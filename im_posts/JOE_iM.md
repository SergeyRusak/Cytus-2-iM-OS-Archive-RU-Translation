It all sounds pretty awesome in the beginning

### WTF!?
**JOEZ Cafe**  
JASUS christ\~  
What, do law and order not exist anymore?  
All I did was go to the kitchen to fix up some food  
only to find out upon return that the entire shop's on the verge of a full\-out brawl, WTF???

Also, what's all this bickering about cream Puffs and strawberry?  
My shop doesn't sell either of those, so if you guys want to fight, keep it outside!

Whatever, rather than whine about this online  
should probably notify the admins first...
### Replies
**foreheadless**  
Show us a photo\~ or even better, show us a recording! lul

**JOEZ Cafe**  
Dumba\*\*, they're fighting INSIDE the shop!  
Ofc I'm gonna stop them first!!!  
If it's outside, then I will definitely record it

**Whysosurprise**  
Strawberry lolololol\~\~\~ Wrong kind of fruit!  
Isn't she your friend LMFAO

**Fu7ureW0rld**  
Is it just me, or is this post itself inviting trouble XDDDD

**noneXenon**  
As owner of JOEZ Cafe  
I thought you were used to situations like this (?)

**JOEZ Cafe**  
Dude, I was utterly shell\-shocked ok  
Just saw a dude who's face was covered in blood  
I thought he poured an entire bottle of YAMAMETO over his head

**Poopytrap**  
Is it so god awful that you have too much left ROFL  
Feels like I'm surrounded by YAMAMETO these days

**Gearz_Igo**  
The brewmaster appears! He is very mad!

**ArupakaKUN**  
Beware the rage of the brewmaster\~

**JOEZ Cafe**  
Guys, I just saw the news of Cherry getting injured  
F\*\*\*! What the hell is wrong with you people!

**moonin**  
Is Cherry going to be ok QQ

**Xzavis**

### OHHH\~\~\~\~\~\~ my beloved one
**JOEZ Cafe**  
Once upon a time  
I failed to cherish you  
Only until losing you did I start to miss you dearly  
Never have I thought that the one who betrayed me  
Would be my best buddy in the band  
He took you away from me, mercilessly (Yes **@Xenon**, I hate you)  
Yet he took no good care of you, tossing you aside like nothing  
Causing you to end up in the hands of a mad cat

BUT, this just in today  
YOU!  
HAVE!  
FINALLY!  
RETURNED!  
HOME!!  
TO!  
MEEEEEEEE!!!  
OH, my beloved Fonder, how I have missed you (French kiss)

That aside, it has truly been a while. Starting to miss the good ol' band days  
I will probably resume my role as a bassist very soon  
Does anyone here wants to JAM with me!?!? I am single and lonely and I need friends\~\~

What the heck are you smoking to write something like this...?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**  
Who are you calling mad cat!!  
Damnit, I shouldn't have given it back (ΦдΦ╬)

**noneXenon**  
So should we now refer to you as King of Germs the bassist XD

**D33M0**  
Bro, you don't have to announce to the world that you're single and lonely LMFAO

**Noposa**  
The bass has random stickers on it lolol

**Bit_Inex**  
I want to JAM!!!!

**HandsomeYi**  
My mind is telling me no\~\~ but my body is telling me yes\~\~\~\~\~

**MatsuyamaC**  
JOE, you better look out for the guy above me...

**CyberLord**  
Let's form a new band!!  
We just so happen to be looking for a BASS guy

**JOEZ Cafe**  
Stop acting like you're innocent, ya filthy thief!  
Yes, I'm talking to you first comment guy!!

**JOEZ Cafe**  
Long time no see, wildcat!! Heard you just got out of the slammer! Come visit; I'll treat you to a drink!

**TreeNoAlice**

### King of Germs owner has had enough!!!
**JOEZ Cafe**  
You bunch of freakin idiots!!!  
Protest here, riot there, and now you are hosting f\*\*\*\*\* mortal kombat in my shop!  
Now my floor is covered with blood\-red YAMAMETO  
Do you guys seriously want me to go bankrupt? Huh???

Therefore!!!!  
Take a look at this brand\-new WaiterKing\-2000!!!  
Not only did it mastered services like preparing the bar and delivering meals  
it can also clean up all the mess in the store with ease  
No matter how sticky and disgusting your puke is, it can make everything squeaky clean in 3 seconds!  
No more accidentally stepping on a puddle of puke that's hiding under the table Muhahahaha!!!!  
It's about time I find someone to help out with the shop, I just can't do it all by myself anymore...  
I welcome everyone to come and play with it (?

**Shibawu**  
Owner, so you learned how to post sponsored content too!??

**JOEZ Cafe**  
Ofc, I learned it from a friend...  
Wait WTF am I talking about? I was not paid by them!!!

**MatsuyamaC**  
So you got nothing yet still promoted their product... Sir, you are such a kind soul  
LMAO

**D33M0**  
The riot really got out of hand fast. So many people lost their cool and forgot to consider the consequences

**CyberLord**  
When I saw the title, I thought you had enough with hemorrhoids or something  
Turns out it's just a sponsored post. I am disappointed

**JOEZ Cafe**  
I've never had hemorrhoids in my life  
Moreover, I've never even had a pimple  
Sorry for disappointing you ^^

**Fu7ureW0rld**  
Is it even physically possible to not have a single pimple? Are you some kind of alien?

**Xenon**  
King of BS.  
Also, you are too old to be using "^ ^";  
Be more aware of your age, you creep.

**JOEZ Cafe**  
Thank you for the compliment ^^  
You can come and lick my floor to see how clean it is ^^  
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Xenon**  
......

**Gearz_Igo**  
Xenon is completely speechless XD

I went and gave it a go the day before yesterday. It was a lot harder than I imagined.  
The owner is really, really good

**w_Rosabel_w**  
Wow, billiards. You don't see those very often these days

**TreeNoAlice**  
How do you play it? Do you swing it like a baseball bat and try to knock the ball into the pockets?

**JOEZ Cafe**  
You can't swing the cue\~ you have to aim carefully and poke your stick at the right hole  
\>///<

**Pinevalley**

### What kind of nonsense BS are they spewing
**JOE**  
Haven't been this p\*\*\*ed off in a long time! My uncle always told me that paparazzi is a job for losers; today I finally get what he meant by that!! I've known Simon since the days of CP. His sense of justice and his dedication to his principles are simply unrivaled. I mean, this dude doesn't even drink booze in my shop! He orders milk all the time! Why the f\*\*\* would anyone think he is an internet terrorist??

Here's also a shoutout to all the damn reporters who want gossip on him. I sincerely invite you to check him out in my shop (Minimum order required). You can look at him while he's helping more people, trying to solve the case, and drinking milk. You'll realize that every word I said about him is absolutely true.

JOE OUT (Drops Mic)

Right on the point Uncle JOE !(ΦωΦ)!  
Xenon really working very hard to help everyone address the problems (ΦωΦ)/

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**  
NEKO is never afraid of reporters anyway  
You a\-holes better watch your back /(Φ皿Φ)/

**JOE**  
Umm... I don't think that's a good idea  
Aren't actions like these why you've been causing him so much trouble...?

**CyberLord**  
Hey a rare social commentary from the owner  
Usually they're either reports about how to hit on girls or promotion for his shop

**RamenBot**  
Wait a sec this is still a promotional post

**Pinevalley**  
I personally don't think that Xenon would do those things  
However, I have to say that with him getting off scot\-free every time and all those rumors out there  
It is no surprise that more and more people around me are starting to feel that there is something "off" about him

**Noposa**  
More and more fans are becoming haters

**RyanRii**  
Didn't expect NEKO to reply to this thread  
Is it wrong for me to be a little excited at the possibility of Cherry appearing as well (?

**lenba**  
Don't be stupid Cherry is under contract with an actual agency. It would be annoying\-AF for them to deal with a paparazzi magazine

**StuffyMouth**  
Owner don't be mad  
I'll go get a drink from you the day after tomorrow

**Pixely99**  
NEKO mostly rely on her fans online to make money. She really doesn't have to give a damn about reporters LMFAO

**maplewing**  
Why isn't it "King of Germs OUT"???
