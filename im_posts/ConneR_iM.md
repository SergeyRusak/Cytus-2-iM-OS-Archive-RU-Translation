Been five years since my last login. Nothing major has changed here apparently. Perhaps the thing that changed the most is myself. 

Everything is a brand\-new start. objectives to achieve, music to play. Will find a path for myself eventually.

Spend some time learning a new instrument called "Violin". According to the records, the Violin is an assembled acoustic instrument. It's made up of the body, the strings and the bow. 

The Violin has a powerful sound and is capable of solo performance. It is agile and can handle complicated verses with ease. It will play a major role in my new composition.

Recently the condition of my prosthetic arm has been god awful, to say the least. Makes me wonder if I accidentally ordered a leg instead of an arm; that or they actually sold me some junk scraped from the morgue.

Gradually getting used to this non\-organic arm, but when awoken in the middle of the night by an unstable nerve shock, I still get a nauseous feeling. Is this the compensation for modern technology?

Can't compose nor perform normally under such conditions. How can I recommend music of such underwhelming quality to my friends?

I am very busy with my work and my research. Do you really think that I have the time to mail it back to the OEM and wait seven to eight days for a repair?

**Ewx_Data**<br>
Sensei got an electronic arm!? What happened??

**DMO**<br>
For performing purposes?

**ConneR**<br>
No, had a minor accident while away from Node08. I would not install this disgusting piece of junk for performing purposes.

**Brightswirls**<br>
That's outrageous! Which brand is it?

BH.

Sir, we are very sorry for the inconvenience we caused. We will send our agent to deal with the issue immediately.

I guess a promotion here wouldn't hurt. My next concert, as usual, will be held at Central Music Hall at Quadrant I. The performance this time will feature classical works of Northen musicians the likes of Rachmaninoff and Stravinsky.

Of course, my newest work will also be featured. Don't miss out on it.

Only Central Music Hall can bring out the characteristics of ConneR Sensei's music.

**ConneR**<br>
Did some research?

**Dogleg**<br>
Central Music Hall can hold almost 2000 people. Reverberation is controlled between 1.85 \~1.9 seconds. A crowned jewel among performance venues.

**Dogleg**<br>
Four floors of seats and boxes, with luxurious curtains and a relief sculpture wall.

**RaiKiyumi**<br>
Jesus why do you know so much?

**DMO**<br>

In terms of artistic attainment, I know my place. I don't consider myself to be knowledgeable by any means. Knowledge is endless, and there is only so much a mere human can obtain throughout a single lifetime. 

Today, through the introduction of a mutual friend, I had a thorough exchange with the scholar of the new generation **@ROBO\_Head**. I was very impressed with his wide array of knowledge. It feels good to meet an old friend in a new place.

**@ConneR** Doctor's research in instruments, classical music and ancient civilizations, worthy for this Unit to learn. ：D

This era, I believe is one that lost its roots.

A variety of music, advanced mixing techniques, constant interactions and collaborations, yet has lost the ability to utilize and enjoy classical instruments, the basis of all music.  

Even more helpless, is that the public has lost its praise and appreciation for the timelessness and beauty of classical music. Affected by the fancy mixing and vulgar lyrics, people now care more about the gossip of musicians rather than their actual music.

Pains me greatly witnessing this.

Master Colin's speech many years ago affected me very much. I greatly appreciate Sensei's words till this day.

Still a while before the information is publicized, but recently I accepted another advisor position. It's in a familiar field, though the unit is not one I particularly agree with. After several back\-and\-forth negotiations, I accepted the position since they are very sincere about it. Once the NDA is lifted I'll talk more about it.

The first assembled acoustic instrument to be discovered is an ancient instrument known as the 'Cello". Perhaps due to its large size, it's preserved in a relatively good condition. It's discovered in a concert hall ruins near Node 13. It was buried 45 meters deep and was detected by an unmanned drone. 

With modern technology, they are many ways to simulate a good low\-pitch string instrument. However, the Cello, which is created with top quality lumber and delicate crafts, can give out a very clear and deep tone. 

A bit sad, yet extremely mesmerizing. This instrument provides a steadiness that makes even the piano, a one\-piece chord instrument, feel inferior.

Sensei will perform with more than 8 different instruments!!!

I heard it when I was visiting Node13. It's a low but melodious tune. I really like it :)

Thank you. I hope to make good use of this opportunity to interact with A.R.C. I believe that I can be of great help in terms of archaeology and ancient documents. <br>
My personal connections with A.R.C. can be traced back to six months ago. As of now, the cooperation experience has been fairly pleasant. Accepting this mission is mutually beneficial for both sides.

The existence of archaeology, is to help humans find what's missing from the past. It helps us study the history of the world and helps humans understand where we came from and where we should go.

People who devoted themselves to archaeology, are not shovel\-wielding, hole\-digging barbarians. They are scholars who study artifacts, read through ancient documents, discover music, and look for history's burial grounds.  

They, are people who pursue the truth.

Due to Node 13's unique historical background, it has quite the collection of well\-preserved instruments. The Saxophone is the instrument that left me the strongest impression in the past five years.  In a bar where I regularly visit, there is this small band that does a live performance every night. Their Saxophonist's superb technique is certainly one of the reasons I kept coming back. 

The Saxophone is an iconic part of Jazz music. Its extremely versatile and free tone allows different performers to give the music their unique twist. The music flows as if it has a soul of its own.

Maybe this is an opportunity for everyone to reflect carefully: are there too many things in the world that we simply can't understand and control.

The Architects created the Node cities on this planet. Did they do it to protect us fragile humans, or are humans mere test rats in a lab?

I feel like that's very unlikely<br>
It seems to have an opposite effect, as more and more people are getting online to discuss these things

Even the admins should have plenty of doubts themselves, right?

Just look at the recent drone incident, so much technology we still can't control properly

People of the modern age seem to be overly focused on pursuing the shallow surface. They often only care about what they see, or more likely, what they want to see. Never once did they think about the context and reasons beneath the surface.

My music is also a rebellion against such oblivious actions. Therefore that's the reason why you can only see me perform in\-person.

Wonder how many people here still remember Architects? I'm fairly confident that humans who existed before my great grandfather's generation had been in contact with them for an extensive amount of time. The Architects provided humans with secure shelters, yet they also left behind countless unsolved mysteries that troubled people to this day. This includes some incidents I personally experienced myself.

Not too long ago, I happened to have the opportunity to get my hands on a set of ancient but very well\-preserved pieces of Architect equipment. Even though a large percentage of them are still in their un\-recreated state, the fact that I could physically research and dismantle one makes me feel very excited.

A gardener was tending to his flowerbed when he discovered a group of ants surrounding an apple that has fallen to the ground. Some ants wanted to start diving in to the delicious fruit right away, Some ants wanted to go back to their hive to bring more ants to carry the apple back. The two sides began to argue with each other. Meanwhile, a third group of ants was busy trying to resolve the conflict; all the while a fourth group of ants was attempting to come up with a solution that can satisfy everybody. 

Have a guess; how did the gardener deal with this fallen apple? He didn't pick up the apple and throw it away. He also didn't wash away the ants with the water hose he was holding. All he did was stand up, and walk away. 

Yeah, who cares.

Special thanks to **@ROBO\_Head** for initiating this conversation, thus giving me an opportunity to make some additions to a previous publication I wrote a long time ago. 

It has been more than two hundred years since humans took over the Administration Bureau and began enslaving the drones with no restraints. We recklessly reconstructed existing infrastructures, tampered with the default designs of city roadmaps, and acted as if we turned on "God Mode" in a game. The drones did not resist, did not complain, yet they continued to fight against humans in secret. In the decade\-plus time since I wrote said publication, accidents are still very much a common occurrence. Humans, in all our self\-declared superiority, couldn't conquer them after all.

Certainly, drones are not creatures. They are just simple, inorganic structures. However, "intelligence" itself is no longer a privilege exclusive only to living creatures. Sounds, visuals, sensations, memories, wisdom, and even the soul are all things that we once thought to be so vague that they were considered ethereal. In this era, however, they can all be interpreted as a combination of countless electronic signals. Humans can no longer claim that we are the one and only "intelligent" mind in this world.

Some people may have doubts about my claims, saying that I was being nothing more than a scaremonger. To those people, I present this: based on the data I obtained, the connection yield rate for the shared UI has yet to show any noteworthy improvement to this day. In fact, the rates have been getting worse. I find that to be the best warning for this situation. For two hundred years, we thought we were the masters of the drones. However, in reality, there is a possibility that humans are the puny insects fed and raised inside the secured area, all while we presumptuously believe ourselves to be the overlords of this planet. <br>
 <br>
The real overlords are far from just an ancient relic in the history books, I sincerely believe that.

Sensei, your papers give me goosebumps, the scared kind...

**Frixion**<br>
I've never thought about the idea of the drones turning on us<br>
After seeing this post, I'm feeling a bit unsettled...

**SIhama**<br>
Imo accidents are bound to happen no matter what. No electronic product has a 100% yield rate after all. <br>
We can deal with the little hiccups just fine. No need to scare ourselves

**DissPoint**<br>
I was expecting more, now I'm a bit disappointed... It's the same old theory, just reworded a bit<br>
I mean, everyone and their mother know that Doc doesn't like machines

**AbigaleJ**<br>
This does resonate a bit with me though. A lot of people take our current daily life for granted, don't they? Maybe all of this is just a toy box designed to keep us distracted from the bigger picture (What can I say, my brain's funky)

**Otis_Emik**<br>
The "overlords" mentioned in the last paragraph, are they the Architects Sensei previously mentioned about??

**Amberclove**<br>
I believe that's the case... Judging from Sensei's past publications, they helped humans build the current Nodes so we can live in the secured area; and they all disappeared after The Decommission

**ConneR**<br>
At least that's what the Academy taught you guys

**Cantspell**<br>
Ooh looks like their's something fishy about that too

**aidan**<br>
OMFG, "There" you moron...<br>
On a side note, it's so damn hard to find any information about the Architects online (Flips Table

**Dogleg**<br>
I feel like Sensei knows a lot of behind\-the\-scenes information, but he just couldn't tell us all of it...

**HC**<br>
Well, in 800 years machines are gonna replace all humans I guess\~<br>
Just like how the old movies play out<br>
Whatever, we're probably all dead as f\*\*\* when that time arrives, won't make a difference

**ConneR**<br>
Take a good look around you, can you say that the matter of "Machines replacing humans" is not an ongoing one? If we take away the machines, what do humans have left?

I hinted about this a while ago. Today, I'm here to make an official announcement.

Because of an invitation from A.R.C., I will be giving lectures at the Academy in my spare time of heading the research project. The topics will be the correct attitude and mental fortitude for archeological excavation. I will also mention my new viewpoints on researches about ancient civilizations. Since it's in the Academy, I won't delve into overly minute details. Nevertheless, I will reveal many unimaginable things that you won't believe exists. You don't want to miss it.

This series of lectures will be available to the public. Anyone can sit in on them. However, I truly hope that there will be other intellectuals present to have a proper discussion with me.

Man, how lazy can you be?<br>
Those who are slothful do not have the right to pursue the truth (In Sensei's tone)

**ConneR**<br>
Extra note here. A.R.C. originally provided me with a pre\-determined handout. They wanted me to give my lecture according to that handout. That file was categorized as spam by my firewall program and deleted alongside other malicious emails. Therefore, I will be using my own material to give the lecture.

In addition, please don't bring any mobile devices or recording equipment to my lectures. I will not prepare any visual aid or handouts for my presentation either. What I'm going to tell you requires no notes; all you need are your ears to hear me talk and your heart to feel my words. I guarantee that you will gain a lot by simply doing what I said.

**DiiR**<br>
Hahaha ConneR sensei's firewall program matches his own personality XDDD

It's not Dr. ConneR if he teaches according to ARC's handouts\~\~ Registered for all the lectures already!!

Action: Successfully registered with block administrators' priority internet access：)

**HWJones**<br>
Thank you to Dr. ConneR for the announcement! Personally, I've been following the public reports of ARC's exploration team for a long time. I have some questions I would like to ask doctor. Can I occupy your time after the lecture ends? I would like to exchange some ideas I had about the recent exploration results.
