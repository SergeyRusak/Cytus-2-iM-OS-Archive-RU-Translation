With each update, the iM UI gets noticably uglier. It's to a point where I can place it in a graveyard and evil spirits will be too scared to even come close to it. I can't take this BS anymore.<br>

Not just that, the entire cyTus connection has been experiencing constant lag these days...

Time to call customer service at A.R.C.<br>
The girl answering phone calls at the service center has a pretty cute voice

TBH, I'm thinking about filing a complaint too. There's no reason your flagship product should have this kind of terrible user experience. <br>
I mean, it's not like A.R.C. doesn't have talented engineers, right?
