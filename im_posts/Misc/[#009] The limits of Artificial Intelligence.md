I know technology is quite developed right now. However, Artificial Intelligence is nowhere near the level of having a virtual girlfriend! WTF is A.R.C. doing?

I thought it's a serious discussion based on the topic; turns out is buncha nonsense...

What are you talking about... did you realize that's the dream of countless single men? Don't act that you never thought of that you nerd\~

As of now, the peak of AI should be **@ROBO\_Head**, right? He can even create his own music

All calculations this Unit has done, result of integrating data from internet. Does not qualify as "Intelligence"

Robo\_head is so strict...

A.R.C.'s mechanical pets are already pretty amazing. They act almost exactly the same as real animals. A while ago my friend's MeowBot got ran over by a car; she cried so hard that I really believe it's an actual pet that died
