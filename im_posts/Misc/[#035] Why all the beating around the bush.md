Monophonic's handling of this case is so infuriating. We don't want refunds; we want to know PAFF's current situation and whether or not she is OK! <br>
I contacted Sis Helena a few times too and got no response at all. God all this anxiety is getting on my nerves, can't even eat properly now>"

Yeah I'm worried sick<br>
Mono's been p\*\*\*ing me off a lot lately

The recent Æsir incident is not properly explained either

**iluvpuf**<br>
Æsir-FEST was already an event where everyone has their own version of the story. Then Robohead came out and revealed that the event was held; it's just that everyone's memory of it was gone. But instead of clearing things up, it led to even more weird-a\*\* speculations lol

\*Raise hand\* I participated, I have no memory

**MAN_Dora**<br>
Anyone have the contact information of other people that work for Mono?

It's pointless. Recently they've issued a gag order to all their employees
