Too many battle royales these days<br>
Do we have something that's more peaceful??

**TunaLee**<br>
For example, we can place a group of players in an area full of weapons<br>
If nobody dies within 30 minutes, all players are then declared winners<br>
Something like that???

What is this, an ultimate challenge to our humanity XDD I feel like it's definitely going to fail because there will never be a winner lol

**HandsomeYi**<br>
Tbh I don't think it's that bad of an idea. It would be quite the wake-up call

**KiwaHu**<br>
Teammates: Hey, we got a gun here. Let's pick it up so players who want to hurt others won't get it.

This is not battle royale anymore<br>
Should call it the peaceful royale

**vveay**<br>
If we go by human nature,<br>
there should be a group of people who consider themselves "righteous" and "fair". They will take away all the weapons first to "manage" them

**STANley**<br>
Then they will start attacking and downing those players that "feel" very dangerous to them

**SYY**<br>
In the end, in order to determine who is truly "dangerous", a conflict will break out and people will start bashing each other's brains in with the weapons

**lrrllrrl**<br>
Wait, then we're reverting back to an actual battle royale again WTH XDDDD

**Hulujam**<br>
Yes, this is human nature after all~~~~

**HC**<br>
