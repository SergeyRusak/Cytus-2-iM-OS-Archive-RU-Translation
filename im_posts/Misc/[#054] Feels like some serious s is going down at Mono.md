Recently, I have access to the Administration Bureau's social hotspot monitoring server due to a research I'm involved in.

Be it internet traffic or actual data density,

the Mono headquarters area is now basically a pressure cooker waiting to explode.

Can anybody go there and see for me what the site actually looks like right now???

I have a friend who is a hardcore fan... He's the one who dragged me here, and now we can't leave...

Can you stream to give everyone a peak of the site??

**Overtale**<br>
No, thanks. I don't think the atmosphere here is suitable for that ~"~
