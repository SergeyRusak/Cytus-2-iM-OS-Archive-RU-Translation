That Colin Neumann Jr. guy that A.R.C. just hired as an advisor, wasn't he arrested by the admins ten years ago for trespassing into the Ruins? Why would A.R.C. get someone with such a questionable resume?

The fact is that the "trespassing into Ruins" thing only applies in Node08, hence the headlines back then. Other Nodes don't give a damn about people wandering into the Ruins. If you ask me, I think A.R.C. has more problems with all the shady stuff with the admins.

I mean, the admins have no business dealing with stuff outside the Node area right lol

Is his trespassing something to do with the hospital?

You can look into the news archives of this guy. For several years, all breakthroughs A.R.C. made happened because of him XD

You mean writing papers that utterly destroyed A.R.C.'s "research"? Hahaha.

He went missing for several years, recently he started a new account for music purposes I think

Colin Sensei is a legend ok? He is not your typical run-of-the-mill scholar
