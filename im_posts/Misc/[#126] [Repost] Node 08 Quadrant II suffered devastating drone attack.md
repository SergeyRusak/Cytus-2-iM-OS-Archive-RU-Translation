> Node 08 Quadrant II's business district suffered a severe drone attack incident. Rumors have come out stating that the attack has left at least 30 dead and over 200 civilians injured. As of now, the Administration Bureau has sealed off all traffic routes entering and exiting that area. Anyone who passes through the area, including pedestrians traveling on foot, must undergo examinations before they can proceed ahead. <br>

> Node 08's business district is a hub area that has always been the most bustling place in 08. Notable landmarks such as Monophonic Entertainment HQ, Central Music Hall, and the Live House District were all affected by the attack to varying degrees. Fortunately, when the attack occurred, most stores had yet to start their business for the day. However, some stores were not as fortunate. For example, the Old Town area, home to the Jazz Bar "JOEZ Cafe" and the renowned Department Store "The Fountains", was pretty much reduced to rubble. The dining street, which houses famous restaurants like "Pizzattic" and "Singularity", also didn't survive the attack and was destroyed almost entirely.<br>

> According to the Administration Bureau, in contrast with the previous sporadic drone malfunctions, this incident was very clearly a targeted attack. There were even instances where large drones crashed into buildings while carrying energy cells or fuel. These cases of suicide attacks have resulted in at least a dozen high-rise buildings suffering structural damage. Official sources have yet to confirm whether this attack was caused by terrorists or not. <br>

If the admins still can't find the culprit after all this, something is seriously wrong with them

My company building is now tilted at a nasty angle<br>
Good thing I decided not to take the elevator when I ran out

No matter who's behind this, if this isn't a declaration of war I don't know what is

**NoLifeGamer**<br>
Admins what the f\*\*\*!! Didn't you just hold a press conference telling everyone NOT to worry? Do you need another 30 people dead for you to do SOMETHING??<br>
Isn't it about time we see some heads roll????

May all who passed away rest in peace. None of them deserve this...

Wait, so does this mean that Pizzattic's secret recipes are all lost in the carnage?? <br>

If he was following his usual schedule, JOE's likely in his store that time preparing to open business for the day...
