# Uh... umm... so, where should I go and hide?

After all the drone attacks, there's no way I can live in the same city as those heartless machines anymore.<br>
Gods of IM, please recommend a place where I don't have to ever look at a drone again. I'm so ready to move.<br>
Besides, I've been single ever since I left the fetus (Entering year 35 now), so it doesn't really matter.

You can just stay at home and never go outside~~~

No way honey, food and package deliveries are mostly done by drones too lmfao

Maybe head to Node13? Heard that the technology there is not very advanced

**KingOtaku**<br>
More info please? On 13

**Varinaya**<br>
A serious accident happened in 13 in the past, so there was this huge anti-technology movement<br>
When ARC first tried to set up a location there, there was even a major riot

**NoLifeGamer**<br>
I think running to 13 just to avoid the drones is a little extreme  ;P<br>
The electrical system there is so basic<br>
and the internet isn't available everywhere<br>
you're gonna get bored to death

**KingOtaku**<br>
!!!??? No internet. Sorry then. Can't do it. <br>
How am I gonna watch all the "useful" stuff over there if there's no internet?

**RaiKiyumi**<br>
Will you really be okay going there XDDD

**DMO**<br>
I think the OP has already given up on that idea
