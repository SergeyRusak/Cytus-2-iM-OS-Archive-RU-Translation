Ehhhh? Is that stuff safe? Wasn't there an incident where that thing went nuts!??

**Roger**<br>
In that incident the guy bought a defective product. Mine's from BH so it will be a-okay

Next time you're going anywhere post it on iM; I'll be sure to stay far away from that location

**@Justin888** We have plenty of service stations all over the world in each Node. If you are really concerned about your safety we suggest that you go live in the forbidden areas.
