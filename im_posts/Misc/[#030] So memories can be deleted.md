# So memories can be deleted?
## Post

I was an audience at Æsir-FEST. Before I don't remember seeing Æsir on stage when recalling this event. I get sick and my memory is blurry.<br>
After reading Robo\_head's post, I am very certain that Æsir did take the stage and perform that day. I'm also quite confident that this is my actual/correct memory. <br>
If this really is the doing of a hacker or virus, this means that memories can be deleted through virtual connection. Therefore I would advise everyone to stay away from it.

Wait but aren't you using it now...

I wrote this post with my phone, not virtual connection... I won't take the risk ever again.

This is nuts. Just read the news and now I see your post. Gotta disconnect now.

Before everything is settled, we should stay away from it. This is much more serious than your memory cell data being wiped...

I also remembered it after seeing the news and Robo\_head's post. On top of that, I began to throw up the very instant I remembered everything...

Let's cut down on the surfing, like seriously...
