> In a recent performance of the popular band Cherry PuNK, lead vocalist Cherry appeared to suffer some serious mismanagement regarding her personal schedule. She was absent for almost 30 minutes before hastily taking the stage to complete the performance. Although her performance is still up to her usual standards, her actions at the start left quite the bad taste. Many audience members criticized her, calling this "The most absurd concert" they've ever seen. <br>
> <br>
> Cherry's late arrival occurred at a charity concert held at Node 08's Central Park. Many audience members actually waited in line overnight just to catch a glimpse of their idol, yet they were slapped with a near-30 minute no-show. Many thought that this was an organized warmup event by the band at first, which led to plenty of complaints. Some fans took to iM to express that Cherry is nowhere near as nice and professional as others have described. Their reasoning is that she didn't even bother to explain why she was late. She just hopped on stage and performed till the end as if nothing has happened. <br>
> <br>
> However, the day following the concert, fan club president CherryMyLife (iM account name) made a statement after contacting Cherry's agent and other band members to understand the situation. He stated that the real reason behind the delay was because Cherry had to deal with a family emergency that suddenly came up. Knowing how disappointed the fans would be of her absence, Cherry rushed to Central Park as fast as she could once she finished addressing the emergency.<br>
> <br>
> Cherry didn't cancel her performance even in the face of an unforeseeable situation. After this information surfaced, her dedication and work ethic immediately received praise from fans and netizens once again, claiming that Cherry is indeed "Node 08 rock's last hope". Praises like "Cherry is the best person I've ever seen.", "We don't deserve Cherry PuNK.", "This is why I will always love her." "Only Cherry can surpass Cherry" can be seen everywhere.<br>

Cherry is what we call a true professional ok~<br>
If it's other artists, they would've probably just canceled the whole thing!

**TunaLee**<br>
Does anyone else feel disgusted by this hollow content farm nonsense we're getting a lot these days??

**moonin**<br>
Her loyal fans probably didn't mind the delay, but the average audience would be pretty mad, right??

**vveay**<br>
Looks like mono's inner management has loads of issues too<br>
Why would anyone allow such a serious mishap??

**CJW**<br>
However, if we were to judge by previous cases, it seems like Mono can't really monitor Cherry either LOLOL<br>
Like the previous incident where she violated her contract, the whole thing barely even made the news

**HC**<br>
Is this what news are nowadays?? Just a compilation of internet comments??

**NnNn**<br>
Oh... so this counts as a report? 

**JusticeMe**<br>
Those comments in the end... just how big of a fanboy do you have to be to make such stupid comments? Guess it takes talent to be a fanboy too ROFL

**SYY**<br>
Turns out that the whole article is just empty fluff. No insider information what so ever

**Curo**<br>
Hey look, it's friends who know how to make big scawy titles~~~~

**lenba**<br>
Breaking! Reporter does your family know that you are copy and pasting internet posts and calling it news?

**RamenBot**<br>
We don't deserve to read such garbage reports

**lrrllrrl**<br>
WTF she just showed up at the end. What did she do to deserve such glowing praise?? Are we that desperate for anything good now?

**maplewing**<br>
I was literally dumbfounded that day. I really thought that LUMY's gonna perform the whole thing herself

**FindCherry**<br>
All PuNK no Cherry

**94Chiang**<br>
Praise the entertainment media and their ability to turn any minute incidents into national emergencies!!
