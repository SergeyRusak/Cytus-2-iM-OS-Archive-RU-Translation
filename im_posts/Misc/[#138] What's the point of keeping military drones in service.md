The Nodes are so small, how can they let those missiles be flying back and forth?<br>
Even if they're suppressing the gangs,non-lethal force is normally used first<br>
Why don't the admins simply decommission those drones?<br>
After they were hacked they just became even more useless.

Just in case~<br>
What if the terrorists or gangs have greater firepower?

**NerfThat**<br>
They still need to consider the damage that might be caused to the city

**TrojanPony**<br>
Agreed<br>
If the TOWER is blows up<br>
half of the city would disappear...

**BUCK$**<br>
won't be easy to blow up the TOWER though...

Be careful. you guys might be blacklisted for dangerous speech w

These incidents should make the admin bureau think hard about what's going on<br>
if they keep letting those heavy-armed drones exist, <br>
who can keep that power under control?

**NoSignal**<br>
anyone who says we don't need force must not live in 03~<br>
The technology gangs from 03 possess way more power than the admins wwww

**Mulder**<br>
The admins of 03 are just a faction of the gang, right?

don't matter if you prep<br>
Who knows what the hell will sneak in from the forbidden areas?

**Wrinkleheart**<br>
Heard rumors that the animals and plants in the forbidden areas do not have natural enemies at all.<br>
Just a bunch of terrifying creatures.
