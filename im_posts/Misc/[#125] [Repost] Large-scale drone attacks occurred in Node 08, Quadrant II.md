> In Quadrant II of Node 08, at least 10 suicide drone attacks have occurred in areas that are densely populated. The detailed number of casualties is not clear, though the firefighters who responded to the site first have stated that the situation does not look optimistic.<br>
> <br>
> At around 3 P.M., the first wave of attacks struck a Law Enforcement patrol post in the outskirts of Quadrant II. Multiple citizens and Law Enforcement Agents suffered minor and critical injuries. Of the critically injured, three already showed no signs of life by the time medical personnel arrived at the site. A witness of the attack told this NNN reporter, that after the first wave of attacks, the remaining drones continued to head toward the business district, most likely preparing for the next attack.<br>
> <br>
> Since these incidents showed clear signs of a terrorist attack, the Administration Bureau has issued an order for first-priority precautionary measures to be taken. All Law Enforcement Agents will be deployed to conduct the investigation. In addition, the flying permits for all drones that are on standby have been revoked. However, drones that are currently conducting missions or offline are still out of their control. If the situation calls for it, these drones will be destroyed or brought down by force.<br>
> <br>
> Based on the news embargo put in place by the Administration Bureau, to all citizens, please head to the designated safety shelters immediately. If the roads to such shelters have already been blocked, please remain indoors. Do not engage or attempt to fight against the drones. Node News Network will continue to broadcast this event by images, text, or audio.<br>

It's different than the sporadic ones we previously saw

Looks like an emergency evacuation has already been carried out in the business district. <br>
But with that many people there is no way they can evacuate everyone in such a short period of time

Is it normal for the sounds of explosions to sound like an earthquake...?
