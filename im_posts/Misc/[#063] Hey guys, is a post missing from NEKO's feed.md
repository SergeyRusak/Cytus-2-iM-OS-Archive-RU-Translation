Ladies and gents, here's your NEKO expert!

Everything about NEKO is imprinted in my brain!!<br>
It seemed that she was going to tell us some big news but there was no follow-up

**DoToro**<br>
If anyone knows, pls PM me thanks!

**Bao**<br>
NEKO spills so much BS that I can no longer tell what is actually important information

**Smurky**<br>
Ummm... do you seriously expect NEKO of all people to give important info???

Seems to have something to do with Mono, but since there's no follow up we have no idea.

**WoooooDy**<br>
Isn't there too much stuff about Mono these days<br>
Like, I'm practically numb to any post with "Mono" in the title
