Sometimes the connection just suddenly gets really slow makes me wonder if I unintentionally connected to another Node's internet<br>

Ah also sometimes when I'm reading articles I get garbled text it's so annoying Is it because my connection device is too dated or is it because the signal interferrence at my work place is too severe

Your lack of punctuation is equally annoying to me

Everything seems fine for me though. The speed is quite fast too. Looks like it's an equipment issue

**Brainmania**<br>
Which equipment is it the chips or the connection cable I'll replace it right away
