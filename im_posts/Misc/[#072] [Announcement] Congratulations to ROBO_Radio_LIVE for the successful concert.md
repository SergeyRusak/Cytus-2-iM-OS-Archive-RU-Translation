To our dear fans and precious customers,

First of all, Monophonic Entertainment would like to congratulate the recently concluded ROBO\_Radio\_LIVE for its overwhelming success. To allow people who love music to all come together and share the emotions is also one of the main goals of Monophonic Entertainment when it was established. 

For the past few days, we've also received a lot of messages from the media and fans about the current contract situation between Cherry PuNK and Monophonic. We will use this opportunity to explain that here as well.

Cherry PuNK's lead vocalist Cherry is still under contract with Monophonic Entertainment, who acts as her album publishing firm as well as her performance agency. The incident this time, where an artist accepted a performance invitation in private, gave us a direct experience of how much the fans adore Cherry. However, we also want to devote all of Monophonic's resources to every single Cherry PuNK performance to make the event even more incredible than it already was. We want our fans to experience the ultimate feast to the eyes and ears. Therefore, the entire Monophonic staff was slightly disappointed when we couldn't participate in ROBO\_Radio\_LIVE together with Cherry. 

Monophonic Entertainment will not pursue legal actions regarding this incident. We also promise everyone that we will continue to improve ourselves so we can create even better spaces for performing and composing. Please continue to follow and support us. Thank you.

Monophonic Entertainment<br>
Entire staff

Keep fighting, even though a lot has happened recently<br>
I still believe that Mono is a very good company

**Rob_Oto**<br>
Fight

**ArupakaKUN**<br>
I thought you guys went bankrupt since you haven't posted in a long~ time (?

**koolboss01**<br>
Is it just me, or does this post gives off that "I don't want to do this, but I have to" vibe lololol

**Porky**<br>
Can't blame them though Cherry is uber popular right now

**JAC-jack**<br>
If Mono really pursued legal actions, things are gonna get ugly, fast

**AbbEE**<br>
Well, of course they can take legal actions XDDDD<br>
if they don't mind losing one of their biggest moneymakers

**moonin**<br>
Very well-handled. Let's us all stand together for music :)))

**Poopytrap**<br>
So you guys are not hand-washing this time???

**Juggernaut**<br>
I will give you one last chance<br>
This is truly the last one though!<br>
If you do anything stupid again I will boycott you forever!!

**Varinaya**<br>
Lemme tell you a joke: People screaming to boycott stuff on iM lul

**Kemcoter**<br>
Nah they're just whining. It really hard to boycott Mono, it's not like boycotting one or two artists will actually cause them any harm

**BUCK$**<br>
Doesn't really matter to me<br>
However, if I like the music, I will still buy it

**SancTityKnight**<br>
Am I the only one who thinks Cherry is kinda in the wrong this time?<br>

**UCantCme**<br>
It's so amusing seeing those nerds defending their idol<br>
Cherry's the one who violated the contract this time, yet they act as if she has done nothing wrong lol

**Hatehate**<br>
Hey man, are you getting paid for that comment?<br>
Better get your boss to treat you to lunch or something

**NotEnof**<br>
R U sure that would be enough XDDD

**WhiteEYE33**<br>
If lunch is not enough, have you ever ask for dinner as well???

**PAFFxNEKO**<br>

Consumers get emotionally blackmailed by big companies<br>
Fans get emotionally blackmailed by artists

**Jingleglimmer**<br>
Mono's response this time is pretty respectful imo<br>
After all, if they really wanted to pursue the case, it would be tough for Cherry to not be in the wrong

**Cherry0987**<br>
Although Cherry violated her contract first, her performance on ROBO\_Radio\_LIVE kicked so much a\*\*!!<br>
It was a treat to see her there~~
