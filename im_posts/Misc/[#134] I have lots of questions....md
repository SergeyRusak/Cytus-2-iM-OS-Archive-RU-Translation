A tier\-1 artist for Mono just dies all of a sudden<br>
Does nobody feel that there's something very strange about this whole thing?<br>
Personal speculations in the comments

Question 1. The cause and the location of death are not stated clearly.<br>
Usually, the death of public figures should be accurately explained to the public.

**Gogossip**<br>
Question 2. Xenon, who has a close relationship with Cherry, is still a fugitive on the run. <br>
Could he know something or, maybe this whole thing it's related to him in the first place?

**Gogossip**<br>
Question 3. The band's post said that it was an accident;<br>
however, if it's an accident in public, there should be news or a report of some kind. Is it an accident that cannot be divulged? 

**888fans**<br>
It certainly is indeed a bit ambiguous...

**Axroid_Sona**<br>
Don't mention Xenon anymore XD

**Go55ip**<br>
Xenon is mentioned so regularly these days that it's not a surprise anymore

**Poopytrap**<br>
Does any news report mention the cause or the location of Cherry's death?

**9me**<br>
I checked it a bit; none so far...

**Tracix**<br>
Maybe it didn't happen in 08 at all?

**GymGai**<br>
I used to hear a rumor that Cherry was involved with gangs during her school days.<br>
But who believes that kinda gossip magazine?

**Revneger**<br>
If it is a vendetta, what is the reasoning?

**AAAnton**<br>
The media has tended not to clearly explain the causes and outcomes of social incidents recently.

**Damn3D**<br>
Are conspiracy theorists all a little anti\-social?
