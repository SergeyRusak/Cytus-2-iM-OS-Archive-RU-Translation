F\*\*\* you. You're just better because you have faster internet and thus lower ping!! Stop acting like you're actually any good!!

**KirinKiraKira**<br>
You need the right tools for the job. Have you never heard that before?

Oops, I forgot that the signal is f\*\*\*\*\* awful in Node 15 LOL<br>
How do you feel about your feeding experience last time

**NekoSamurai**<br>
Well, we're a remote island. What do you want me to do

**KirinKiraKira**<br>
Behave yourself and act as bait for the other team

I presume it's because he couldn't express his stupidity online for days due to the connection problems

**KirinKiraKira**<br>
What does that hav to do with you? F\*\*\* off

**UltraKY**<br>
OP's probably the type of brat who visits other Nodes with oxygen masks ready because "Ooh the air is so bad"<br>
