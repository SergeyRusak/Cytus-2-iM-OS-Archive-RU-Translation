I just saw a group of things fly by the clock tower here at the Academy. <br>
Are they drones? I've never seen them flying in a massive group like that.

Maybe they're doing test flights??

Birds? Really? When's the last time you saw birds in 08??

**Chevalier151**<br>
Which way were they flying toward?

**Arya_Poke**<br>
Looked like they were going from Quadrant I to Quadrant III

**AbigaleJ**<br>
Definitely drones. I saw 'em too. But the group I saw was headed toward Quadrant II

**IronFan**<br>
Eh... Is it normal for drones to start crashing into buildings??????????

**Pixely99**<br>
Think I heard the sound of explosions@@??

**JAC-jack**<br>
The drones are out of control!!!! <br>
Stay as far away from them as possible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
