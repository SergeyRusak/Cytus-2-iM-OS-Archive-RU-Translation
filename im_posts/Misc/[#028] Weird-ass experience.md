This is a weird-ass experience I heard from a friend's friend. He said that he fell asleep without removing the virtual connection cable. He had a dream where he's surfing the net and sending messages to friends. After he woke up, he found out that it wasn't just a dream; he actually sent out those messages in real life...

Didn't the manual for the chips say that you shouldn't sleep with the cable connected?

Woah that's creepy. Never thought the "it's a dream so I can do whatever I want" scenario would actually exist OAO
