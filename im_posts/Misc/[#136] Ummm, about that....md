**T.Goldwell**<br>
Only a few human sounds can be heard

**Noposa**<br>
There were a bunch of drones messing around just a few moments ago, weren't there?

**Pixely99**<br>
Nah seems to have stopped

**RyanRii**<br>
Huh, seems that they really stopped attacking (?

**Duncan128**<br>
Great! It's ok to go out now (So scared...

**MemeYan**<br>
The drones seem to have gone back to normal.

**HandsomeYi**<br>
Holy moly so itâ€™s really just an error, not a terrorist attack??

**Uxi**<br>
Stay alert. may be a trick...<br>
Once we relax, the next wave of attacks will come

**DDStream**<br>
S\*\*\*, shut it!

**CHanatsuka**<br>
So the drones have read Art of War????

**KiwaHu**<br>
First attack, then suddenly stop deliverin meals?<br>
Scam confirmed.

**TunaLee**<br>
Even worse... the meals inside have expired XD

**Curo**<br>
Missed the point wwwww, but it looks too weird to return to normal just like this<br>
Are we supposed to pretend like nothing's wrong?

If there's really someone manipulating all those drones<br>

The drone around my area is starting to clean the roads<br>
Turns out it's a street sweeper?? <br>
It was just holding a disinfectant and tried to poison me!!!
