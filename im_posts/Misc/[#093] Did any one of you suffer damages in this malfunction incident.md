Our hospital got hit really hard in this incident<br>
It's like we drew the short straw on every single occasion<br>
Any device that requires connection got wiped out pretty much entirely<br>
Many patients in intensive care or has special diseases, unfortunately, passed away because of this <br>
(Surprisingly, there were also some patients whose symptoms got better)<br>
Just suddenly realize how severe the risks can be when we are so overly reliant on a singular system<br>
ARC did send someone later to discuss compensation with the higher-ups of the hospital<br>
However, it all just felt too late...

Even though you should already feel numb to life and death since you're in a hospital, stuff like this still makes me very upset

Good work to all the doctors

**AaA**<br>
Thank you to all the doctors who held their posts in such a time of crisis

**BbB**<br>
Are there any ways we can give donations to the victims' families??

**Tracix**<br>
Wait, so no backup system at all for such delicate equipment?? QAQ

**Andy_Roid**<br>
ARC had better shell out some serious money for this screw-up

**StuffyMouth**<br>
So there were people who got better??

**9tingale**<br>
Yes, patients with Virtual-Internet Related Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder

9tingale, have you ever thought about becoming a knowledge-type streamer?<br>
I've always found your articles to be professional and useful

**Mimosa_droid**<br>
You can call yourself Miss Doctor or something

**Neon_raven**<br>
There are so many things wrong with that I won't even bother to correct you<br>
Dr. 9tingale would be a much better title

**IronFan**<br>
I support that~~~~~~

A prayer to all those who passed away \*Pray\*. May they all rest in peace

Back then when the internet broke down, I thought to myself "OH, crap." Nowadays, so many services and systems are deeply tied to the internet. It's guaranteed chaos if anything happens to it. And what do we know?

**Henry**<br>
All my bank services also got completely wiped out that day~~~~<br>
The money I transferred is still lost in the void

**Snor_eDen**<br>
If anyone needs help. feel free to contact me. I'll see what I can do.

I feel like there's absolutely a loophole in the user agreement<br>
No way in hell would they ever compensate the whole amount!!!<br>

By "getting better", do you mean that they woke from their coma??

**9tingale**<br>
Their brainwaves have returned to normal intervals<br>
But the reason why we noticed this is that there actually were patients who regained their consciousness<br>
It's a bit like they suddenly woke up from a deep sleep<br>
However, it's only for that brief time period, so we can't really call this a cure

**Krypton**<br>
If that's the case, maybe you should inform ARC about this too

**Henry**<br>
Maybe not now, as I bet they are currently in complete chaos trying to handle all the compensation and insurance stuff
