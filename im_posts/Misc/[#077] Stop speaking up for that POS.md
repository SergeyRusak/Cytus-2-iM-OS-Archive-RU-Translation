Isn't Xenon the most suspicious one ever since this whole incident started???<br>
This issue of 08 Daily stated that too<br>
He's a computer genius who started to display his talents at a very young age<br>
He personally established many security regulations and protocols after he joined A.R.C.<br>
During Ã†sir-FEST he was allegedly (according to himself) monitoring the internet back-end at A.R.C.<br>
He knows NEKO very well so it shouldn't be difficult at all for him to hack into her stream<br>
Every single case that he's involved in so far have become unsolved mysteries<br>
The answers don't get more obvious than that, right?<br>
These days on iM the issues of random garbled text and deleted comments have also been increasing<br>
Could it be that these are side effects of him tampering with the virtual internet in the past??

F\*\*\*! Can't stand those idiots who are speaking up for him<br>
What because he's handsome he won't do anything wrong?

**UltraKY**<br>
Never seen him without his helmet maybe he's so nervous about being found out that he doesn't have the balls to show people his real face??

**4nonymous**<br>
Maybe his helmet is woven together by his hair (WTF?

**Shibawu**<br>
I had enough of iM's recent BS<br>
Way too many screw ups<br>
Guess I'll switch to MewCHaTS after all

**Arya_Poke**<br>
I don't doubt that Xenon may be capable of doing this<br>
But what about his motives??

**GymGai**<br>
Perhaps his motive is that he wants to get girls (and he succeeded in getting two goddesses, f\*\*\* I'm so jealous)

**888fans**<br>
More like a goddess and a noisy brat right???

On a side note, have we experienced anything like this in the past regarding the internet?? Don't think we have
