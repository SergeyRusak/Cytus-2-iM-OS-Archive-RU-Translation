> The drone attacks that lasted for several days seemed to have been brought under control at noon today, stopping the destruction that rained down on the city and the attacks on citizens at almost the same time. Drones even returned to their normal flight patterns to begin working again. This has caused citizens to wonder whether it was just an error or a terrorist attack that was been carefully designed.<br>
> <br>
> However, due to the heavy losses caused by the attacks, the Administration Bureau was initially unable to propose an effective solution. That was until the A.R.C. indicated its willingness to support, thereby initiating military counter\-attacks. Many citizens expressed great dissatisfaction; the reputation of the Administration Bureau has reached its lowest level in the past two decades.<br>

What reputation? Aren't they all just inefficient bureaucrats??

**XXXenon**<br>
Why does all of this look like a farce now...

**StuffyMouth**<br>
Casualties need to be compensated... big time<br>
Saying that it was something unexpected or something they couldn't handle is just shirking responsibility

**noneXenon**<br>
We can't stop searching to find out who's responsible!

**Varinaya**<br>
The fricking worst! We'll find out who's pulling the strings!

Æsir?? Xenon??  Coincidence? I think NOT!

**Talus_Alpha**<br>
And if it’s a hacker terrorist attack, Xenon could definitely do it

The big boss in Node 08 is ARC after all<br>
The admins r just their dogs

**JaneHikaru**<br>
The admins have such a weak social network. How do they have the right to manage the city???

**DuskDawn**<br>
I think it’s a terrorist attack... definitely a conspiracy

**PoolsKitten**<br>
Whatevs it’s okay now\~<br>
Everyone can return to normal life.

**AbigaleJ**<br>
No way. I think I have PTSD and can’t get close to drones anymore

**Pinevalley**<br>
They might suddenly start to smash your face in...
