Ummm, h\-hey guys\~\~ I'm still alive haha\~\~<br>
Sorry, it seems like I freaked everyone out<br>
When my store got blown up, I just so happened to be crushed underneath all those cases of Yamameto<br>
Those nasty drinks ended up absorbing most of the impact for me, which kept lil' ol' me alive (Turns out I did the right thing ordering so much of that damn stuff!?)

The Yamameto explosion caused me to look as if I was covered in flesh and blood<br>
Maybe that's why I wasn't discovered by other drones? (Scratches head)

All in all<br>
Although there is still tons of stuff I need to sort out<br>
(Things that were reduced to ash not included, so it might be a lot easier than I thought)<br>
This post is more or less to report my safety to everyone<br>
Hope that other injured folks can hang in there and make it as well<br>
JOE out (Mic drop)
