In my dream, the most influential organization in Node 08 actually contains some shady people that are stealing their recreated-yet-undeveloped tech to sell them for a huge profit. You know, dangerous things like Anti-gravity tech~ weapons of mass destruction~ enhancement surgery~ bioweapons...etc.

Think about it, what if Æsir-FEST is also a part of their experiments? Maybe the admins already now, but still allow it to happen because of mysterious reasons?

A.R.C.'s core principle is to maximize technology development. It sounds fine and dandy by saying that it's "for the sake of humanity", but in fact they may still want to control everything, right? The two-to-three-hour memories of millions of people seem like an insignificant sacrifice under these ideals.

This sounds way too much like a conspiracy theory. I mean, what benefit does this bring them?

**Dreamer**<br>
Maybe there's some super advanced tech that requires an experiment of this scale. Don't forget that before the virtual internet was developed, A.R.C. was nowhere near its current status of power 

**MaxLCK**<br>
I have plenty of friends who work at A.R.C., I believe they won't do something like this

I feel like all things exist for a reason though<br>
If there are rumors. there's always a possibility that it's real

**SuduMan**<br>
Guy above me, you are falling into the conspiracy theorists' trap by thinking like that!!
