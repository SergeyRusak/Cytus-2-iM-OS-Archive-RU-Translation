# Requesting witness information regarding PAFF's whereabouts
## Post

Hello everyone,<br>
Like all of you, I am a PUFFER. I love PAFF and her singing as much as every one of you; and just like all of you, I am also very concerned about her since her disappearance

Even though the law enforcement agents are already searching for her, I still want to contribute to the cause, however minor it may be. Several friends and I created a website in hopes that we could gather all possible witnesses available online regarding PAFF's whereabouts. We will sort through the information and send teams to investigate if we determine the tip to be credible. If you want to participate as well, please visit the following website for more details on this operation. Come and help us find our beloved PAFF.

WOW 300 witness information immediately, are you serious lol

We will try our best to sort through them. Please rest assured.

Hmm, this is not a bad idea at all. If we put all of the internet's positive capabilities to good use, we might be able to actually find PAFF this time. I've joined as well<br>

It's really touching to see positive voluntary actions like this after all that rioting went down<br>
Hope you guys can get good results!!<br>

Not really a PAFF fan, but what you guys are doing is awe-inspiring. Keep up the good work!

However, if it's in a restricted area, you can't do much, right?<br>
Regular folks simply have no access to those places

**PaffCheckin**<br>
Yes. If that's the case, we can only let the Administration Bureau handle it<br>
If it's an accessible location, we will try our best to visit it

You're are a true Puffer. Wish you the best of luck

Wish for PAFF to be safe too<br>
