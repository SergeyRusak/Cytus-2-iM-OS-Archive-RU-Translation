> An Administration Bureau spokesperson stated: "Concerning the recent sporadic incidents of drones injuring people on accident, our early analysis has labeled this as a system error within the automatic control center. This error caused the system to mistakenly sent unrelated commands to the drones which caused them to malfunction and act abnormally. We've already activated the security protocol. This will increase the patrol frequency of armed Law Enforcement Agents, as well as improve the anti-drone capabilities of Enforcer Drones."<br>

> At the same time, A.R.C's Recreated Technology Department also stated that they will be assisting in the investigation to determine if there exist other safety concerns that have been overlooked. However, regarding the drones in use right now, they reaffirmed that there is no need for the public to be worried...<br>

I'm pretty sure all the, you know, DEATHS have made everyone uneasy

**NerfThat**<br>
Okay maybe if you look at the total number of drones, this ratio of malfunction is indeed extremely low??

**Brightswirls**<br>
I tell you what. Those people who were there at the accident site that day will definitely not think like that...

**Ewx_Data**<br>
Aren't these things supposed to have ZERO malfunctions????????<br>
Like people are actually DYING because of this!!!!

**fotoistruth**<br>
Is anyone as worried as I am? <br>
What if the Enforcer Drones go berserk as well? Isn't that gonna be way worse with all that "improvement" they made?

**Amberclove**<br>
I also think that improving the firepower for Enforcer drones is dumb and really terrifying

**888fans**<br>
I bet you 5 bucks what they thought was: As long as the Enforcer Drones don't malfunction, everything is a-okay~~~~

Speaking of ARC, they sure have been f\*\*\*ing up a lot lately...

**Bolt_Urx**<br>
When nothing happens, people don't usually think about ARC.<br>
But then you realize that almost all technology you see in your daily life is under their control lol

The Law Enforcement Agents really got it tough 0rz. No wonder my dad doesn't want me to take the exam
