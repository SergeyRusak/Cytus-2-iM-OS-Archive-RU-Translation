Feels like it has nothing to do with the original appeal now?<br>
Like, at first, everybody was just worried about the safety of PAFF. <br>
That's why we were all mad at Mono for hiding the truth. <br>
Why is it that right now, it just looks like a bunch of random idiots causing trouble for the sake of it??<br>
Like what the hell does attacking an innocent artist have to do with all this??

Can't help it. Most people can't use their brains properly

They'll spit nonsense like "Who cares my idol's missing, I want mental compensation Boo Hoo" or some BS like that (?

These days, reasonable comments get buried by the mob...

Also that MonoWillPay tag makes it seem like it's really Mono's wrongdoing when clearly it's not

**KiwaHu**<br>
If they are actual fans, shouldn't help finding PAFF be the more urgent thing to do?

**JAC-jack**<br>
Which shows that a lot of the people in this commotion don't actually care about her; they just wanted to use this chance to cause trouble

From the **\#PrayForPaff** to the **\#MonoWillPay** now, feels like everybody just wants someone else to solve the problem for them

I think Mono is unlucky-AF wwwww

TBH, I feel like Mono didn't do anything wrong from start to finish. The only mistake is that they hid the truth for too long lol
