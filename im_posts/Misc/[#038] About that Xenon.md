Aren't you working some sort of internet security-related job at A.R.C.?<br>
Got anything?<br>

What related job? The entire virtual internet security system is basically his handiwork lul, well maybe there's a team who works with him

**ShadowForest**<br>
It seems like he's not willing to say too much about this

**DuskDawn**<br>
Hiding something?

**Doubty**<br>
Maybe he's the one behind it

**Brock3tt**<br>
Don't like him

**Irisa0938**<br>
He rarely talks about work on his account in the first place

**Copper_stone**<br>
Probably another one of A.R.C.'s pets; never expected much from him

**Arya_Poke**<br>
Rumor has it that he has a s\*\*\*\*\* personality, and his love life is a mess too 

**AntiMetal**<br>
People in music bands are always like that, especially metal bands

**Gogossip**<br>
Got gossip?

**Cipher_troll**<br>
There were rumors about him dating NEKO a while ago, then recently someone saw him getting back together with his ex-girlfriend Cherry

**Andy_Roid**<br>
Cherry? Who's that?

**CyberLord**<br>
That Cherry PuNK girl right? The one that has been covering up for PAFF a lot these days

**Rob_Oto**<br>
