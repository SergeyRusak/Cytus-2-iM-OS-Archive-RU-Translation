That event with that A something DJ really scared me, so I tend to stay away from it... So everyone else is working just fine |||

No problems on my device either<br>
Maybe if you're nicer to me tomorrow it will work again LOL

My connection is working just fine though~~ Did you guys remember to pay for your internet @@

We've been continually monitoring the connection quality over here. Recently, the connection is indeed a bit unstable. The record shows that there were several sudden disconnects and login issues. We hope ARC can address these issues as soon as possible.
