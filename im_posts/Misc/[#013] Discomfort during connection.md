Recently when I connect to cyTus, I get this nauseating feeling. Doctors can't figure out what's wrong either. Should I file a complaint to A.R.C.?

My friend also has similar issues, problems with the chips?

Does the nausea just pop up randomly? or do they appear under certain circumstances?

**Majaja**<br>
Yes! It only occurs during virtual connections. Every time I get this Déjà vu feel, not sure if it's music I've heard or scenes I've seen. Then the nausea starts.

Remember to drink chocolate milk to lessen the discomfort XDDD
