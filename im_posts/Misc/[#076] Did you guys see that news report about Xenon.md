# Did you guys see that news report about Xenon???

I feel like the tone of 08 Daily's reports is a bit biased. Like from the beginning, the reporter's attitude is always one where she's trying hard to dig up some dirt about X, or at least it seems that way.<br>
Like, it's very noticeable in her previous report about picking up NEKO from the Bureau too. I don't think a reporter should have a presumption like that, or is that just me??<br>
Although I am a bit surprised by the things Xenon did as a teenager, isn't that pretty cool as well?<br>
It's like a superhero saving the world! Something every regular civilian (me included) would love to do!

You already admit that you're a fan of that POS, what's the point of trying to support him??

It does feel like the report is kicking someone while they're down. But the points it made are not entirely unreasonable

F\*\*\* If I was a super hacker during my dumb teenage years<br>
I would've made it big already!<br>
Anyone with that kind of power is going to be corrupted no matter what they do

God f\*\*\*\*\* damnit iM!! Do you want me to type or not!!!

08 Daily also released a survey down by a third-party organization that shows over 70% of people believe that there is a high possibility Xenon is involved in the incident

**TunaLee**<br>
What kind of dumb survey is that??? Who did it?

**Curo**<br>
About that...<br>
The so-called "Third-party organization" later came out and clarified that they did not do such a survey<br>
It's very likely that 08 Daily faked it themselves
