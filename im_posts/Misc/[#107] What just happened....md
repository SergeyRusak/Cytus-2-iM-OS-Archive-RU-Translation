Lol jail? More like his personal toilet<br>
He comes in, takes a few dumps and s\*\*\*\* all over the place, then leaves whenever he feels like it

WTH XDDDDDD God I don't know why but that description is just so funny to me ROFL

Man so many dank memes these days<br>
I pity those who accidentally gain internet infamy without ever realizing it

**vveay**<br>
Let's have a bet how long this post will stay up before ARC files a report to get it removed XDDD I say a few days since they'll be desperate to save face

Who's that poor guy whose face got pasted over with Xenon's head LMFAO

Oh crap... It feels like even if in the end this is NOT the truth<br>
the power of memes will ensure that no one on the internet would ever believe them

**maplewing**<br>
Do not underestimate the spreading power of memes

**lenba**<br>

Have a nice day!

**JAC-jack**<br>
On top of that, no one would bother to even listen to your explanations and would just proceed to call you stupid/useless

**NnNn**<br>
Dude this topic is kinda sensitive. You don't want ARC coming after your a\*\*

**C.Y.**<br>
Come on\~\~\~ What year is it that we still have people scared of that nonsense???
