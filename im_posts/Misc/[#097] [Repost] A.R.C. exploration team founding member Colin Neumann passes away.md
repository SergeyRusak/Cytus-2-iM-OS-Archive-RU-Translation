**RestinHell**<br>
RIP, even though I didn't really like him before

**NerfThat**<br>
Why all of a sudden!!!???

**XenonMyLife**<br>
Sensei, I really loved your music<br>
May your soul rest in peace

My god, this year is such a terrible year. So many sad things... R.I.P.

**HWJones**<br>
R U serious 702... Is taking PAFF away from me not enough~~~

I am so fortunate that I was able to go to his previous concert<br>
It's an honor of a lifetime to participate in the final performance of a master

**Never_Show**<br>
What! I was planning to enroll in his class next semester too!!!!

A legend has passed away, just like that<br>
This reminds us that we should seize the moment<br>
and don't dream about going down the wrong path. <br>
Punishment may not come immediately, but it will come one day<br>
Be charitable, be kind

**KYBuster**<br>
WTF are you talking about?<br>
Are you trying to imply that he deserves to die because of his actions????

**FakeFANS**<br>
If you think about it, without ConneR sensei's contributions<br>
many ancient technologies would probably still be buried and never see the light of day<br>
Rest in peace sensei

**Elextron**<br>
Life is so unpredictable. I previously thought sensei would either die on stage in a spectacular final performance or die during an excavation accident<br>
Never imagined he would die of illness in his own home

**WannaBuy**<br>
Will people sell sensei's prosthetic eye and arm as commemorative items? I want to buy them and enshrine them at home

**C.Y.**<br>
U serious... It's year 702 already... When will people learn to start using their brains before posting these stupid comments???

**CJW**<br>
Utterly speechless... So that's how rumors are created. People can't even read the title correctly LOL

**Dogleg**<br>
Is English too difficult a language for you morons to read? <br>
ConneR's full name is Colin Neumann Jr. This is his father, not him!!

**Curo**<br>
The first few comments are so freakin cringeworthy ROFL
