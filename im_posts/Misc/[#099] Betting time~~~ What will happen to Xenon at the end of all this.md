I'll cast my vote first; I personally think it's B<br>
No way in hell would ARC just give up and let the admins snatch away such a talent<br>
The obvious way to go is to get him out, then make him repay that favor by working his a\*\* off for you. That's how you squeeze out all the value!

**Wrinkleheart**<br>
Locked up for life feels too harsh...<br>
I don't think this is a crime that deserves that severe of a punishment

**in9odwetrust**<br>
You never know there were quite a few indirect deaths caused by the malfunction of the internet, gotta take that into account too

**WAW**<br>
Wait you mean the previous massive internet malfunction case is also related to Xenon???<br>
Or is that just your personal speculation?

**SIhama**<br>
Does nobody wants to add new options lol<br>
I've been thinking...<br>
Maybe someone will go and jailbreak him outta there?

**StuffyMouth**<br>
No f\*\*\*in way LOL<br>
The security in that place is super tight. One wrong step and you'll be riddled with bullets by the drones XD

**Watch_Burn**<br>
If you ask me, I say there are no more than 3 people in the entirety of Node 08 who are skilled enough to carry that plan out

**GemFeather**<br>
I bet he'll be declared non-guilty and acquitted. The admins f\*\*\*ed up and arrested the wrong guy in the first place!

**Manpora**<br>
I'm a fanboy of Xenon, so my bet is on C!<br>
That place is no match for the best hacker in the entire world!!!

**RamenBot**<br>
One vote for admin screw up<br>
I find it really difficult to trust anything the admins put out

**fotoistruth**<br>
ARC is so deeply connected with the admins, some sort of secret negotiation behind closed doors is totally possible, right?

**Prime6750911**<br>
He tainted my two goddesses, two life sentences

**UltraKY**<br>
The moral of this story: don't f\*\*\* with an angry weeb, or you'll get locked up for life. Ohhhh, so scary LMFAO

**Henry**<br>
I also feel like someone will bust him out<br>
Xenon should have a pretty wide web of connections

**Krypton**<br>
I feel like he also needs to first state clearly why he pleaded guilty. If not, why would anybody want to save him???

**FlyingCodo**<br>
Possibility of folks breaking him out to perform lynching (?
