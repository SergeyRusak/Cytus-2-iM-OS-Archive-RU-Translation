I only know about this due to the news report on the recent riots. From what I recall, drones are also technology that has not been fully recreated, yet we can already modify them?<br>

My friend's uncle works at the Administration Bureau. He told me that that it's fine to do minor modifications. However, there are indeed still a lot of things they don't understand about the drones.

**AvaJaKeLon**<br>
He also showed me this catalogue. Excluding the earlier models that caused accidents in the past, there are still seven or eight models of drones that are in service right now. Each model has its own specific purpose. Too bad I don't remember any of them

Yikes can you actually show that kind of info to people

**AvaJaKeLon**<br>
... Maybe it's better for me to stop talking XD

**TrojanPony**<br>
Come on tell us more<br>
That way, we will know how to counter them when they are trying to suppress us in the future

**Mulder**<br>
Does this count as inapporpriate speech XD
