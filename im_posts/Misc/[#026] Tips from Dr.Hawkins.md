# Tips from Dr.Hawkins

Dr. Hawkins:<br>
Although it's a bit weird to give this tip on iM, I would advise everyone to control their time using the internet. <br>
Recently, there has been a significant increase in patients who visit us due to discomfort caused by virtual connections. We have categorized them as victims of an internet addiction syndrome.<br>
No matter how advanced technology has become, using the virtual connection for a long period of time will still cause a certain level of stress to the brain. Please take good care of your body.

Agreed. Many of my friends are like that and their memory is getting worse

I'm so scared that I'm keeping my surfing time to under 2 hours per session...

What should we do if we are already affected??

**Dr. Hawkins**<br>
As of now, there is no complete cure for faltering in memory/balance and cognitive disorders. Patients with serious symptoms sometimes fall into a coma.

Just like the past, failure in eyesight due to overuse of electronic products is also incurable. Therefore before we discover a complete solution, I can only give tips like this to prevent these symptoms from happening in the first place.
