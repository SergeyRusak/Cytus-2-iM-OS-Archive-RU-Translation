**Smurky**<br>
Several audiences also fainted as well. A collaborated act?

**NEKOSAIKOU**<br>
Maybe the singing is so horrible that they rather faint lolololol

**beeeeeeeeee**<br>
I think it might be real this time. I mean what's the benefit of making such a fuss?

**NEKOSAIKOU**<br>
Are you dumb? They need this fuss to cover up their old news. Remember all that copyright controversy Mono is going through? Nobody's talking about it now with all this tragedy stuff taking over the headlines lololol

**Poopytrap**<br>
Hmmm you had a point there XD

**NEKOSAIKOU**<br>
**@NEKO\#ΦωΦ** has already seen through all this BS man she good LOLOL
