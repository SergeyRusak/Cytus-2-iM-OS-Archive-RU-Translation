# Can this Mono s*** fiesta end already?

At first, we just want Mono to find the missing person and properly handle the aftermath of this incident<br>
But when I went there, completely different story. The entire site is utterly out of control with no clear goal.The original purpose of the protest is all but lost...

Don't you know that a blinded, angry mob is scary-AF

That NEKO stream also added more fuel to the fire if you think about it…

**MustangMartin**<br>
Ah, you have a point. That stream was what caused the whole thing to blow up… (BOOM~!

Moreover, what she said was probably exaggerated Her dissatisfaction towards Mono is well documented

**SYY**<br>
BTW, didn't NEKO just got back from the admins due to the Æsir incident? Is it ok for her to start spewing nonsense like this so soon LMFAO lolololol

**BUCK$**<br>
Too young, too naïve lul

One can say that Cherry was indirectly screwed by NEKO…

**MustangMartin**<br>
I personally feel like it's time we end this<br>
but it seems like a lot of folks on-site don't agree with me…

**Justin888**<br>
Things can get really ugly if this continues…

**NoProblemo**<br>
Imo, Mono is really patient about this already <br>
If it's the admins, they might want to deal with this in the most efficient way possible
