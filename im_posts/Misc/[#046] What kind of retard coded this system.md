And here I was thinking that I can finally get a refund...<br>
only for the entire system to suck BALLS!!!<br>
The user interface is straight up horrendous...<br>
Did they hire an intern to code this in thirty minutes???

Yeah, same here. When the "System overcrowded" window popped up, I felt like my head's gonna explode right there!! Probably going to a physical location later to refund

**MonoShachiku**<br>
Could it be that there are simply too many connections all at once??

**SancTityKnight**<br>
From what I've heard the physical locations aren't any better either
