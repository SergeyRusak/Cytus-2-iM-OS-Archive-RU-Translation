# Something we must tell everyone

CherryPuNK:<br>
This is a sad news, but we have to let everybody know. Last week, our band's lead vocalist Cherry, real name Sherry Pauline, has left us due to an accident.

We're still in shock and disbelief regarding this sudden tragedy. She is so considerate, so kind, and so talented. Our thoughts and prayers are with her family and friends, as well as all of you who loved her.

Cherry PuNK the band was born because of Cherry. She's the one who gathered us to realize our dreams of playing music together. We three have decided to suspend any band activities indefinitely. We would like everybody to give us some time to heal and collect ourselves.

Last but not least,<br>
For Cherry

You will always be in our hearts

Is this some kind of out-of-season April Fools' joke or something?

**Gearz_Igo**<br>
Nobody would joke about their lead vocalist's death.<br>
If it really is a joke, I say it's way too much...
