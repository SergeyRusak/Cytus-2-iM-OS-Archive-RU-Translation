I don't care if this whole thing is staged or not<br>
I never believed one bit that Xenon would be locked up for real<br>
It's all just a show for the public<br>
Nobody will remember a thing after six months~~~

Keep making ARC more money<br>
Continue F\*\*\*ing up their opponents

Brillant move by whoever staged this<br>
I think it's safe to say that the admins will never solve this case now

Iirc, someone predicted on iM that he'll be rescued<br>
People made fun of him back then<br>
Well, guess who's the prophet now LOLOL

**JAC-jack**<br>
All hail the return of justice???

Dude, drones are scary-AF and they kill whatever comes into sight<br>
Whoever broke in to get him out must have balls of steel

**Chevalier151**<br>
Xenon's backing is simply too strong<br>
Not even the admins can hurt him

**KirinKiraKira**<br>
Will A.R.C. admit that they're the ones who did all that XDDD

**Sopheee**<br>
What is this soap opera nonsense~ Who wrote this crap!
