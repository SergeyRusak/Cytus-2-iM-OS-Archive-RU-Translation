# New behind the scenes update on Xenon's love triangle!
NEKO#ΦωΦ? Cherry?
## Post
Vicky:<br>
A few days ago, popular streamer NEKO\#ΦωΦ, who was acquitted of all charges for her involvement in the infamous hacking incident, has returned to her home. Previously, this paper caught sight of one-man band leader Xenon and CherryPuNK lead vocalist Cherry accompanying her as she left the Bureau. Today, there has been a new update to the situation. 

Yesterday afternoon, Xenon left his home alone. After cautiously looking around, he rode his motorcycle directly to a civilian household on 07 street in Quadrant II. That household turned out to be NEKO's home. According to photos taken by our reporter on-site, Xenon was welcomed into the house by NEKO's family and went directly to her room. For around 20 minutes, the two stayed in her room, alone. The lights were turned off, making it impossible for us to determine what they were up to. As sunset approached, Xenon did not stay for dinner. After a quick chat with NEKO at the doorway, he left on his motorcycle. 

The other female in this love triangle, Cherry, was accidentally injured during the recent protests in front of Mono HQ. At the time of this visit, she was resting in the hospital. Xenon chose not to visit her at the time; instead, he chose to visit NEKO at her home. Does this mean that he finally made his decision? Or is he still wandering between the two and playing his dangerous game of love? For more behind-the-scenes information on this case, please follow 08 Daily. We will continue providing updates on the situation.

NEKO is too young and too naive... Of all people, she had to pick... an internet musician LOL

Yeah he's a piece of s\*\*\*. What kind of man abandons a patient to go on a date with his new gf? I bet he won't give a damn even if his ex-girlfriend dies

**CyberLord**<br>
I find this report's wording to be purposely tasteless. That's only my opinion though (Heard those are the magic words XD)

**11IIll11**<br>
The one who's tasteless is the two-timer who toys with people's feelings

**GymGai**<br>
Can't help it. He is way too suspicious. I have a feeling that he is still hiding many secrets<br>
Sis Vicky, we can only depend on you!
