Discover the secrets, painstaking investigation: Æsir-FEST event report series Part 4

After reading parts 1 ~ 3 of our in-depth coverage reports, we believe that everyone now has a better understanding regarding the ins and outs of the entire  Æsir-FEST incident.<br>
In this report, 08 Daily will be shifting the focus from the mysterious Æsir to another person who's deeply connected with this incident. If you are a loyal reader of our magazine, our follow-up report regarding the hacking incident of the streamer NEKO should still ring a bell. That's right! The focus of today's report has multiple key identities, including back-end system administrator of A.R.C., rumored current boyfriend of NEKO and Ex-boyfriend of Cherry PuNK main vocalist Cherry, Xenon (Real name: Simon Jackson).

Not long after his graduation, he joined A.R.C.'s internet security department and participated in the establishment of many of the current internet security protocols and regulations. Why did A.R.C., an organization that was quite notorious for their attention to their applicants' educational background, allow Xenon, a former high school dropout, to join such a crucial department? It's impossible to not be suspicious of such a decision.

According to the information leaked to our news center by an insider, Xenon's role and administrative power in A.R.C. are much more complicated than what they announced to the public. He is not your average system administrator. He is someone who has unrestricted access to any block and is practically a god to the internet. In addition, as someone who is very familiar with all the regulations and protocols, he can also easily bypass any encrypted... (Read more)

Can anyone who subscribed give me a hint about whether or not it's worth paying money for?
