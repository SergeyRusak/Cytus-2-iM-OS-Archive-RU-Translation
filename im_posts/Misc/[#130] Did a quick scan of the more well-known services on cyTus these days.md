1. The new personal information trojan horse virus' affected range includes all connection devices before V11 (In theory, because I don't have devices before V5 with me. However, nobody should be using those XD)

2. The more they fix iM, the crappier it gets. However, the development team has announced the update plans for next season. Can look forward to it.

3. A random hacker group has stated that several major producers of connection devices and equipment have been infiltrated by scammers. In the future, there's a possibility that brand\-new connection devices will have virus programs built into them.

4. Some forum blocks have claimed that Mono's music platform has already been cracked; still unproven. There is a chance that this is true, but Mono has ways to stop this. For example, once they detect a user of the cracked version, they can immediately lock on to the user and inform the admins of their position. This action is totally legal in the current regulations of the Administration Bureau. Thus, I still advise everyone to not attempt this kind of stuff.

5. Perhaps not too many people have taken notice of this, but the cyTus main system hasn't been updated for quite a while now (People don't normally read this it's just my personal interest lololol). The internal version has been stuck at V24, which is rather confusing. A while ago, a list of updates for V25 were leaked by an insider. I was a little bit excited about it. Despite that, there hasn't been any action for such a long time. Anybody knows what's going on???

It really has been a long wait for V25<br>
What's with the complete dead silence

**STANley**<br>
Not to mention the updates from V20 to V24 were super fast.

**SYY**<br>
Maybe ARC's development have encountered problems?<br>
And btw the update has been fast just for that time period XD Before it was also slow, SUPER slow.

It seems every time a product is previewed by Master Henry, it ends up a mess. \#HenryNooo

**Andy_Roid**<br>
The connection device with a built\-in Trojan virus sounds really god awful

**Talus_Alpha**<br>
True. Who would check the system versions of cyTus as a hobby? XDDDDD

**Ayx_Socket**<br>
I don't think we can expect iM to get any better anytime soon lul
