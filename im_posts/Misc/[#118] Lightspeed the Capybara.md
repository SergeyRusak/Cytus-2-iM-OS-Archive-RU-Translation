I feel like they're going in the wrong direction... <br>
Why is he always in a hot spring balancing oranges on his head??? <br>
Shouldn't he be running around and fighting bad guys??

**beeeeeeeeee**<br>
Probably because all his battles take place at light speed, so we can't see any of them ;-)

**CHanatsuka**<br>
Dude, no one cares about the stoopid movie!!! The Attack of the Drones are ongoing right now~~~~~

**KirinKiraKira**<br>
Send Lightspeed to take care of the drones~~

**HandsomeYi**<br>
Who thought of this crap <br>
If it's light speed how dafaq are we gonna watch? <br>
So the movie's gonna be 100% in slow motion??

What kind of animal is Lightspeed? A giant rat or something?

**KiwaHu**<br>
Well, it's definitely NOT a giraffe that's 4 sure~

**Duncan128**<br>
WTF ROFLLLL It's a capybara, obviously. It's in his goddamn name lolol

**FlyingCodo**<br>
Care more about the attacks you damn nerds!!!

**CyberLord**<br>
ARC will deal with this, right? They should know these drones better than anybody~!

**Noposa**<br>
Are they putting this crap trailer as some kind of publicity stunt?? Wouldnt surprise me. "All publicity is good publicity" is very much a thing

**Rabbitdora**<br>
Have this many malfunctions ever happened simultaneously before????
