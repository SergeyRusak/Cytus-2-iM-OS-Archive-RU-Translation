I heard my friend say<br>
that PAFF was discovered running around on the streets with NEKO<br>
Never thought that the legendary Yuri ship that only exists in the weebs' mind will become canon one day!!<br>
Bow down to your Yuri overlords~~~~~~

She has been missing for so long, I thought she got caught up in some kind of accident QAQ Although she's now together with the wildcat (who I really don't like), I still hope she can return to the stage soon!!

**CeLiA**<br>
That's awesome news!!! Someone go inform Sis Helena ASAP~~~~~

**noneXenon**<br>
Why were they running around @@ Did they encounter some kind of danger??

**iluvpuf**<br>
Does anyone know where they ran to?

**LyLah1207**<br>
Where did the witness report originate? Can someone confirm it for us? I feel like there's something very odd about this
