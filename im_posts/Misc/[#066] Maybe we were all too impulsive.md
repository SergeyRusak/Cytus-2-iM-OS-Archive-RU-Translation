I was there on-site for all of the previous riots. I was indeed quite p\*\*\*ed off at first. When the admins started interfering, I was also furious because I don't know why they were helping Mono with their shady businesses. However, I do feel like we were the ones to blame for injuring an innocent artist too. We can't just pretend that everything is Mono's fault.

I know that I might get a lot of hate for this, but we should all calm down and think about this carefully imho

There's no denying that Mono did a crappy job handling this<br>
However, there are things (PAFF's self-disappearance included) that are not entirely their fault

Really don't want to speak up for Mono... But to riot in the streets for something this minor, that's just flat-out wrong

**DDStream**<br>
I've been wanting to say this for a long time, that there's something seriously not right about this<br>
But even my friends were really mad towards Mono on this

Causing trouble in the real world just from some stupid internet rally. If that's not retarded, I don't know what is<br>
A shut-in at least stays at home and doesn't cause harm to the society

**CandiceNaoko**<br>
That NEKO stream certainly didn't help either... Everyone has to shoulder some responsibility

**NEKOSAIKOU**<br>
ROFL look at these idiots blaming their own stupid actions on NEKO lol<br>
If you want to be dumb, at least be man enough to admit that it's a decision from your own brain and not talk BS about NEKO!!

Says the guy who's infamous for being THE source of internet bulls\*\*\*<br>
Literally ANYONE is more qualified to speak about this subject than your sorry a\*\*

Agreed. I report that ID every time I see it

But he's not completely wrong on this particular incident. We're all grown-ups. It's not like we live in a gangster movie where we have to hit the streets every time we bicker<br>

Regardless of all this... I'm still so worried about PAFF... Hope we can find her ASAP<br>
