> We have received the latest news. Just earlier today, A.R.C. backend administrator Simon Jackson has been arrested in A.R.C. by law enforcement agents. Our sources show that he is none other than the biggest suspect for "Æsir", the mastermind behind the recent string of internet crime incidents. <br>
> <br>
> According to our inside sources, the Administration Bureau received investigative information from an A.R.C. employee. The employee accused Simon Jackson of using a specialized A.I. that has yet to clear safety protocols for all kinds of operations. The Administration Bureau decided to delve further into the situation. However, when they came across A.R.C.'s system program records, they discovered a large number of commands used by said A.I. to commit internet crimes, which even includes the infamous cyberterrorism incident during a live stream a few months ago. All this evidence are proof of Simon Jackson's highly possible association with Æsir. <br>
> <br>
> Faced with such serious accusations, Simon Jackson did not say a single word to defend himself, nor attempted to prove his innocence. Instead, he appeared at the Bureau with law enforcement agents and has been very cooperative throughout the process. We are currently chasing this news in real-time and will update you with the latest information at any time. <br>

**DoToro**<br>
Been following him for a long time, now I feel like a fool... It's like I'm the accomplice of a criminal

**CyberLord**<br>
Man, you're not alone<br>
I just deleted all music that is related to him, whether it's Xenon or Æsir

**Abbyl**<br>
I still can't believe it QQ

**Axroid_Sona**<br>
Face reality. He didn't even utter a word! No innocent people will be this quiet! Told you guys, I felt there was something wrong with him a long time ago. Now the truth shows that HE is the biggest culprit behind this whole incident!

**11IIll11**<br>
NEKO has been defending him all this time, yet he had the gall to attack her AND play with her feelings. Disgusting

**kou**<br>
My younger brother is still in a coma because of him... It's all his fault...

**Arayray**<br>
He still hasn't woke up? Oh my god... I wish your brother the best of luck qq

**noneXenon**<br>
They got the wrong person, right? Xenon can't be this kind of person, can he?

**fotoistruth**<br>
You never know the true side of a person until you see it. If not for Sis Vicky, we would all definitely still be in the dark.<br>
Top-level journalism is a necessary part of a developed society after all

**Nyd_Ans**<br>
Such a world-class scandal at the very start of this century... We need to lock terrorist like him up ASAP

**888fans**<br>

**AntiMetal**<br>
Fanboys and fangirls, get REKT XDDDD

**Nyd_Ans**<br>
You only find out who is swimming naked when the tide goes out~~~~~  Bet those fanboys are all butt-naked now~~

**Go55ip**<br>
Sis Vicky is the media heroine we deserve AND need right now

**USurBrain**<br>
Is it possible that he can still hack the s\*\*\* out of everyone even in custody?

**fotoistruth**<br>
Out of Neko and Cherry, I wonder who out of the two will stay by his side

**Copper_stone**<br>
Run as far away as possible ofc~~~~ What kind of idiot will choose to stay with him

**AntiMetal**<br>
Yeah yeah go praise your now worthless posters stupid fanboys

**xxScarlexx**<br>
Xenon... How come...

**WAW**<br>
Not showing any signs of resistance during his arrest, does this mean that he's secretly pleading guilty???

**noneXenon**<br>
Xenon is supposed to be a very careful person. Even if he does do something bad, he shouldn't leave such obvious clues either, right???

**AntiMetal**<br>
Did you morons get your brains burnt from defending him too much?

**GymGai**<br>
If it really is Xenon<br>
Then when Robohead exposed the truth months ago, he was like "Oh I'm figuring out a way to help everyone..." Dang that was some excellent acting, wasn't it???

**Wrinkleheart**<br>
I thought 4 sure he would resist arrestment. <br>
Guess he is not the physical type after all

**NEKOSAIKOU**<br>
F\*\*\* doesn't that make him an absolute music genius

**Curo**<br>
Crap, he is even more godly now. Genius hacker + genius musician

**Poopytrap**<br>
Time to binge-hear Æsir music to let off some steam

**4nonymous**<br>
Thank you to the admins for arresting Æsir<br>
Can you punish him by making him compose more music @@

**Copper_stone**<br>
Xenon repay me my internet bills

**Axroid_Sona**<br>
Not surprised, can't expect someone who wouldn't show his real face to the public to be any sort of a "good guy" LOLOL

**AngryMan**<br>
Good thing that I didn't really like his music to begin with<br>
I have several friends who are trashing their albums right now LMFAO
