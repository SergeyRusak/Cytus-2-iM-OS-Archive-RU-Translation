Today, on my way to my part-time job, I suddenly heard a commotion coming from the crowd<br>
I turned around and I think I heard someone yelling NEKO's name<br>
So I just sort of instinctively press the shutter<br>
I ended up capturing a photo that's pretty amazing!!<br>
Looks like the internet rumors about PAFF hiding in NEKO's home turn out to be actually true!!!

Man, you dumb. You should've just sold this photo directly to the media~~~<br>
I bet 08 Daily would absolutely pay a fortune for it

**Ararar**<br>
\*Sobs\* I'm so sad why do I never get chances like this  QAQ

**NathaN**<br>
Dude that's some EX rank luck!! You just bumped into an SSR character on the road!

**iluvpuf**<br>
I hope this is true! PAFF is safe after all!!! My day just got so much better~

NOICE, actual breaking news. Haven't gotten those in a long time<br>
These days, there have been so much Xenon news that I feel a bit disgusted whenever I see one now

**Doubty**<br>
Same here LOLOL It's the same s\*\*\* every single day so damn annoying

**PoolsKitten**<br>
If it's true, then I can rest assured since PAFF is safe<br>
But what caused the commotion?? I'm getting a bit worried again

**BbB**<br>
I believe it's time to Tag sis Vicky so she can see this post

**Chevalier151**<br>
Mono, look.<br>
Somebody did your job for you!!!

**Arya_Poke**<br>
If only we have **@ROBO\_Head** here to perform precise analysis of the people in the photo<br>
We would've gotten further confirmation of their identities

**AbigaleJ**<br>
Dude, no need to Tag Robohead<br>
He has not answered any comments nor posted anything recently@@

**IronFan**<br>
So nobody even bothered to chase after them to make sure???

**Varinaya**<br>
It seems like they avoided the crowd in the end. My friend said that they did run pass her; really does look a lot like PAFF. Should be the real one
