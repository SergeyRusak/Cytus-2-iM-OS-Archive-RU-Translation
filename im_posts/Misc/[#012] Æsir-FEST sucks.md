Found a ticket stub for Æsir-FEST in the drawer, got really pissed off when I remember that the main act never showed up!!!

Thank goodness it's free, and we still got the opening performances of Robo\_head and PAFF

I don't remember the opening acts too well, but it's NOT OK to make everyone wait in front of the main stage for two goddamn hours

How come what I've heard it's that there was a blackout?

**Rabbitdora**<br>
But didn't NEKO said that it just wasn't held at all? Is it really a blackout?

**Popo**<br>
What blackout? It was bright as s\*\*\*
