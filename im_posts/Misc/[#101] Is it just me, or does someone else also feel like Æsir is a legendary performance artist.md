# Is it just me, or does someone else also feel like Æsir is a legendary performance artist?

Æsir (I think it should be fair to directly call him Simon or Xenon now)<br>
is totally a legendary performance artist~~~~~

When he debuted, he only distributed music on the internet for free: A rebellious attitude to the pop music industry that only cares about money

Invited famous artists to host a completely free Live performance: A symbol that music has no borders and should be accessible to everyone

At the end of the Live, erase everyone's memory and take it away: A sign that artists have absolute control over their own work

Hacking of an annoying streamer: A warning to ignorant brats. The world of the internet is not a place for you naive children to be messing around in

Real identity discovered: Everything turns out to be planned by the seemingly self-righteous and self-proclaimed "defender of justice" Xenon. A lesson that tells everyone to not trust shallow and egotistical truths so easily

I almost believed you, ALMOST

**CeeJay**<br>
What the heck are you smoking?

**Trashtalker**<br>
You've successfully blurred the line between Xenon hater and fanboy cuz I have no idea which one you are after reading all this

**AAAnton**<br>
Is it just me, or has the letter X start to develop powers? Cuz every time I see it, I get this sense of nausea, dizziness and want to puke (faint

**RaiKiyumi**<br>
I feel like I have visual fatigue from seeing it so much<br>
I often have times where I suddenly don't know how to pronounce the letter "X"

**Lynx87**<br>
Keeping going, you are this close to persuading me

**Cipher_troll**<br>
There are so many damn loopholes in that. You can't just casually skip over everything like that without addressing the details. Context is important!

**noneXenon**<br>
If Xenon ever gets a bail, will everyone be willing to donate money to fund his bail?

**xxScarlexx**<br>
I'll donate I want to do something for him!!!!

**HolyEarth**<br>
Holy s\*\*\* This is the most amazing speculation I've seen since this incident occurred<br>
Can I repost it to my private chat group XDDDD

**Copper_stone**<br>
So... he performance-arted himself to an arrest? Is he stupid or what<br>
Many of them pretty serious crimes too

**Fu7ureW0rld**<br>
I still believe that Xenon is innocent, something's definitely fishy about this case

**Logicker**<br>
Wait but Xenon did charge people money for his personal Live lol<br>
The logic makes no sense there, doesn't it???

**Pumpkinforest**<br>
He can dispute any illogical loopholes with that last point anyway. He is never wrong no matter what

**Muahaha**<br>
OP, have you ever consider starting a cult?<br>
You seem pretty good at BSing people

**Gearz_Igo**<br>
Hey look, it's friends who know how to talk nonsense~~~

**Trashtalker**<br>
I'm also a performance artist. I oversleep and is late for school every day. I use my personal experience to prove the importance of time management since I overslept for my midterm and is now completely f\*\*\*ed
