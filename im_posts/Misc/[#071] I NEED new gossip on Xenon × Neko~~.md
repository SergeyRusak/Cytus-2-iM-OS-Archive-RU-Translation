You guys have too much free time... Who they want to be with is none of your f\*\*\*\* business

Who is C? Is it CONNER sensei? I'm totally down for that C×X

**SuperKY**<br>
Cherry is literally a goddess. Good\-looking and has a great personality too. That POS Xenon doesn't deserve to be with her<br>
As with NEKO, just a spoiled brat whose mouth moves faster than her brain. Spamming emoticons like she's a retarded child; just like the OP

...... WTF a blank comment?

**9me**<br>
I even checked again to make sure that my eyes were not seeing things. How the heck do you send a blank comment? Doesn't the system block those

I definitely typed something. Why did they turn blank when I hit send? The f\*\*\* is this thing doing >皿

It's clear that ARC finds this discussion pointless, hence why they decided to screw with you<br>
On a side note, I wonder if X will go see both his waifus perform at RRL

**UltraKY**<br>
X: Make no mistake, I'm saying that everyone else is mine as well
