Our demands are based on evidence and good reasons. Today, if the Administration Bureau demands us to leave, then we should have the right to demand an apology and mental compensation from Monophonic Entertainment. We devoted our time and money to PAFF, yet we get treated like garbage by the agency. Is that even fair????

About that Cherry, she rode PAFF's coattails to fame anymore. that b\*\*\*\* had it coming!!

You can't tell if people are being sarcastic or serious these days...

Are sure it's ok to say something like that? BTW, Cherry was so unlucky...

**Tracix**<br>
Seconded. Like it must really suck to get injured on your way to work...

**Grimwood**<br>

**PunisheR**<br>
