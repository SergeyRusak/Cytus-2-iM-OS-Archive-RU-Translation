# English pronunciation very important
## Post
t×pazolite:<br>
Because my english is poor sometimes I use wrong pronunciation. A while ago when I performed at Node 47, a staff member asked me in English if I am ready or not. I wanted to say "I'm ready" but I said "I'm lady". I'm not lady.

Does 47 speaks English as well??<br>
I've always wanted to visit that place at least once

That's just because English is the most universal of all existing languages<br>
It's what the Academy taught us<br>
Doesn't really matter to me. It's not like English is hard or anything; anyone can learn it without trying

Sir, do you have any idea how many people you just p\*\*\*ed off with that last line?
