# Anybody know what the final passcode for See2 is?

Lately, a friend sucked me into<br>
buying the game See2: US<br>
After beating it all, this screen popped up and asked for a password to unlock extra content<br>
Does someone know the password?<br>
or did I miss something??

WHAT!!!?? I didn't even get that final password screen!!!! WTF???

**C.Y.**<br>
It's not that hard actually. Think back for a sec and you'll get it tbh

**Hulujam**<br>
UHHHHHH still don't know 0rz

**CHanatsuka**<br>
After entering the password, what happened next made me cry like a baby<br>
Like, who's cutting these goddamn onions QQ

**STANley**<br>
For me, not experiencing this hidden content is like not even playing the game at all

**Hulujam**<br>
Help me, please~~

**lrrllrrl**<br>
It's mentioned in the earlier storylines<br>
You should look for it yourself~~~

Why are you people giving him such a hard time??<br>
Is this what IM is like now?<br>
It's obvious he's asking for an answer. Is it really that hard to give a proper reply?<br>
Or maybe everyone is just pretending to know when they really don't?<br>
Is this really necessary? Are you all stupid?

**JessiaAvison**<br>
Dude, you're the one who's stupid here. Some (or I should say most) people prefer not to spoil a game in a comment section.<br>
Calling people out doesn't make you better; it just makes you look like a hypocritical fool who doesn't know what he's bumbling about.

**beeeeeeeeee**<br>
Come on let's not argue over See2. <br>

**Noposa**<br>

How do you guys pronounce See2: US? Is it "Seetus" or "SeetwoUS"?

**KiwaHu**<br>
I pronounce it "See2: US".
