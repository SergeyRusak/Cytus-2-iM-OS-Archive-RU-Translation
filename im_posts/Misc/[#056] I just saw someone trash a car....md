Feels like a lot of freaky people are mixed in the crowd??<br>
But I don't have the balls to yell "Stop it, you cream puffs"...

It's practically a gang parade now, isn't it?

**ElinaDaniel**<br>
Really learned something new in this incident<br>
Turns out there are a lot of cream Puffs in the gang business

**MemeYan**<br>
Dude, WTH?

**Talus_Alpha**<br>
Didn't a bunch of gang members got arrested just a few days ago? Also, from what I can tell, those in the crowd appears to be just net users and/or fans

To be fair, I saw the call on a forum and thought I could maybe get some quick cash out of this. That's the only reason I'm here...

Gotcha\~\~\~\~\~\~ It's people like you who add fuel to the fire! (TBH, compare to those actually wrecking stuff, folks like you seems to be minor offenders)

**HandsomeYi**<br>
Looks like a lot of people got riled up by NEKO's stream and forgot about common sense

I wanna go home...<br>
After seeing Cherry get injured, I start to feel like I wasn't in the right mind when I decided to come here...

**Uxi**<br>
Can you actually come out though?? Heard that the admins are ready to start using moderate removal methods

**Michiko**<br>
It's way too difficult to garner the support of public opinion when your protest is targeted at a private business<br>
Not to mention that they even assaulted an innocent person, not a good look
