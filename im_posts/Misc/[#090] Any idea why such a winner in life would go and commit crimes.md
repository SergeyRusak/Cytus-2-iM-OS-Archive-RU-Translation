Seriously, why?<br>
Genius, has a job that pays really well, knows how to play music, BOTH his rumored girlfriends are super hot/cute girls anyone would die to date<br>
It's not like he's a loser weeb like me who can only get a tiny sense of happiness through dating sims and simulation games<br>
Just... why the heck would he want to host a concert to delete everyone's memory?<br>
Is he a psychopath or what?

Maybe he has some sort of rare disease that allows him to achieve orgasm by deleting people's memories

In addition, people won't even remember the ahegao you have when you delete their memories

Ooh, how convenient

To get inspiration for songs? I have heard that some artists get their creative rush through negative emotions like violence and crimes. Maybe that's the case??

Goddamnit he is such a winner in life! I am jealous AF

Both NEKO and CHERRY are great!!! I often have... thoughts when I look at them

If you're someone who has followed Xenon from the very beginning,<br>
it's very difficult to imagine that he's someone who would do such things...

Iirc, his motivations were not stated clearly in the news<br>
Usually, if someone pleads guilty directly without a motivation, something's definitely fishy, right

**DDStream**<br>
So... guilty was "pleaded" for him?<br>
Basically, a sacrificial lamb??

Isn't it precisely because he's a winner in life that gave him the idea that he can get away with whatever bullcrap he does?

**aidan**<br>
Most winners in life ended up being complete f\*\*\* ups too<br>
You will treasure the things you have only if you achieved them through your own hard work!!

I am proud to say that I've cleared all the routes for any dating sim I play!!<br>

The world of a genius is hard to understand. Perhaps there really is a reason that none of us ever thought about!

**NEKOSAIKOU**<br>
Welp, can't help it then, guess I'll be the one to comfort NEKO

**AlwaysKY**<br>
Maybe he lost in truth or dare?

**DogBark**<br>
Imo, there is definitely still more shady stuff that folks are not saying
