I remember that I attended the launch celebration party, but have no memories of what actually happened. I woke up today on my bed still wearing my suit<br>

Did you really not remember anything lul? Maybe you've been Ã†sir-ed XDD

**lenba**<br>
I somewhat recalled that I talked a lot of nonsense?<br>
Oh god, I hope that I didn't say anything TOO offensive?

**Hulujam**<br>
I think you're ok. Your colleague from Node14 took that cake for "most WTF" last night XD

**STANley**<br>
You mean **@Kemcoter** ?? LOLOLOL

**Marshall**<br>
Was he really THAT drunk XDD

**beeeeeeeeee**<br>
Dude he was TRASHED!! He had absolutely no memories of what happened XDDDD

**NathaN**<br>
He went completely nuts and started slurring his native language nonstop. Oh and he ate bananas with his bare hands

**RamenBot**<br>
Wait, what bananas??

**lrrllrrl**<br>
He peeled the entire banana (like the whole thing) and grabbed it with his bare hands then started swinging it around like he's Donkey Kong on crack. I... I can't...

**@lenba** you were super cute yesterday though

**maplewing**<br>
Wanna see a recording XDDD

**lenba**<br>
U...ummm I'll pass on that XD

Should we hold another party the next time we have a product launch?

**C.Y.**<br>
Sure

**Kemcoter**<br>
I woke up in the middle of the night yesterday only to find myself sleeping on the lobby floor. Why did nobody wake me up!!!

**moonin**<br>
Because after you got drunk, you were running around like a madman and literally sticking your face to other people's faces when they were trying to talk to you!!!

**KiwaHu**<br>
**@Kemcoter** so that was you. I was wondering why there's a weird noise outside, hence why I never left my office.

**JAC-jack**<br>
Goddamnit I was not there f\*\*\*\*\*\* ~~~~ looks like I missed a lot of good s\*\*\*!!

**CHanatsuka**<br>
No worries man. We'll hold another one when the next version launches!!
