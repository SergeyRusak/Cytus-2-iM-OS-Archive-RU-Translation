Mono probably thinks that this is none of their business anymore, don't they? They see that they can't handle the situation, so they terminate the contract and abandon her. They think we are stupid enough to let them off scot\-free with no responsibility after turning the entire situation to s\*\*\* 

If that's their attitude, we are not stopping at just surrounding the building this time. I'll be on my way first. You guys can follow up later

Why would the admins help a private business? Could there be a collusion??

Or maybe it's just because you guys are rioters who deserve to be arrested for being f\*\*\*\*\*\* idiots in public

**De_Fort**<br>
