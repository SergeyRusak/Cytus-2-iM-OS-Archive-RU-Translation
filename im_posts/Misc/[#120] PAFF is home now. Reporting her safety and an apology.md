# PAFF is home now. Reporting her safety and an apology
## Post
Helena:<br>
Hello everybody, this is Paff's older sister Helena White

First, I'd like to thank all of you for your support and encouragement you've given since PAFF went missing. If it weren't for all your passion and consolation, I don't know if I'd still be here today. Also, I'd like to especially thank anyone who has provided tips and assistance in finding PAFF.

PAFF has contacted us in the past few days and we now know that she is both safe and has trustworthy friends by her side. Since a lot of complicated things have happened, it's not possible to explain them all here, so I am very sorry about that. I feel like she needs some time to collect herself too. Therefore, I  just want to inform everybody that there is no longer any need to search for PAFF, so please refrain from asking for her exact whereabouts. Whether or not she will return to the stage as an idol singer is entirely up to her. If she ever makes a decision, we will announce it.

Thank you, everyone, for being with us all this time. The pain that has been felt cannot be forgotten, but everything we have now means the world to us. Thank you.

The video message above is a message to all of you recorded by PAFF herself. Hope everyone can feel at ease now.

Helena White

Artists don't care about being insulted. They're more scared of not being discussed QAQ
