I don't know who the hell it was that suggested I order some YAMAMETO fruit beer. <br>
I shipped in several boxes and ain't no one's ordering it!!<br>
Should've trust my instincts<br>
Tomato with hops!? The only palates that can handle that are sickos and smashed drunks~~~

Now there's this giant mountain of YAMAMETO just sitting there behind the bar...<br>
All it takes it's a fatso to crash into them and we'll have ourselves a massive explosion~
