Just came back from a holiday, man finally feels alive again. You really need to leave your job completely to get actual rest... I attended a mental enhancing camp in another Node; it was a great experience.

Your application actually got granted?

Last time I had to wait in line for an entire morning before it's finally my turn...

I though cross-Node traveling is the pain in the neck. Last time someone's application wasn't granted... they had to be deported from another Node and sent back QQ

It worked just fine for me though. Just remember to apply earlier, then wait for a short while. As long as you inform your company everything should be okay.

It's a bit annoying, but an early application does indeed help.

Maybe I should plan a trip too. I'm way too exhausted at work these days.
