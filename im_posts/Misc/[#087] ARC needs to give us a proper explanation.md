I was really angry that all we get is a template announcement about the system being fixed

I'm a registered nurse at hospital 15<br>
In this day and age, most medical systems are connected to the cyTus system<br>
There is a central system that universally oversees everything on each floor<br>
When the whole system broke down this time, it was a manpower shortage catastrophe for the entire hospital<br>
Not to mention the many patients on the intensive care floors who relied on life support systems just to stay alive<br>
All of them gone in a snap of the finger. We didn't even have time to save them

I realize that this was a very serious accident<br>
However, the cyTus system is already this crucial to human society<br>
Shouldn't ARC shoulder a bit more social responsibility?

At the very least, we have the right to know more secrets, right?

Agreed. My company was also in a huge mess due to the situation this time. They should come out and give us a proper explanation

I feel like ARC has already done well enough for us<br>
Without the ancient technology they excavated, we're probably still drilling wood for fire<br>
Everybody is so strict

Not like we want to be strict, but this is human lives we're talking about!!

**Talus_Alpha**<br>
Our world is already deeply rooted in ARC's systems. Without it, we couldn't even survive.<br>
Nevertheless, it is a bit scary if this keeps happening. We are relying on it so much yet issues still occur on a regular basis...

Ask not what ARC can tell you<br>
Ask what you can do for ARC

**vveay**<br>
Get out. This is a serious discussion and not a place for you to talk s\*\*\*

If we think about it carefully, every single human in Node 08 is a user of ARC<br>
I don't think it's too much to ask for a bit of security promise

**HandsomeYi**<br>
These ungrateful a\-holes asking for so much, who would want to be a hero if this is what they get?<br>
I support ARC.  Ignore these stupid haters

**AntiMetal**<br>
LOLOL Isn't the most famous hero within ARC a super hacker in the past? Legal criminal we're talking here

**UltraKY**<br>
When I see the previous comment, can't help but have a dream. No need to wait too long. A big announcement is coming soon. Everybody is going to be so shocked

Ah, I woke up. Better watch the news

**Gogossip**<br>
Dude you got something??
