Although instances of separate drone malfunctions did occur before this it's getting a little out of hand (Multiple drones malfunction all at once??) <br>
After all this, people are gonna get PTSD when they see a drone  Who do you think is the one pulling the strings behind the scenes?<br>
ARC? The Administration Bureau?? Xenon getting his revenge on society???

As for 08, this is indeed not the first time. It's practically part of daily already (?

And the relief pitcher of the year goes to... Xenon!

**SuperKY**<br>
Real Culprit: Oh no. Something's gone wrong. Quick, blame it on Xenon~

For real, I think ARC wants to use this opportunity to take back the control of all drones that previously belonged to the admins

**fotoistruth**<br>
I'm thinking the exact opposite. I think the admins don't want ARC to have too much power. Therefore, they're making people cautious regarding technology. This way, folks won't rely on ARC tech and products too much

Hey dumba\*\*<br>
If the admins did that<br>
They're the ones that are gonna have to clean up the aftermath, not ARC<br>
Plus, how would they know that public opinion will be on their side once everything goes to s\*\*\*?

**GymGai**<br>
Imo I think us Mono. They want to get out of the entertainment industry and join the military industry XD

Annnnndddd the s\*\*\*posting begins again<br>
Didn't even make it past the 10th comment this time

TBH, I might freak out a little when I see a drone on the streets after all this, even if it's just the trash-collecting type...

**888fans**<br>
If a hacker is really this good and can hack this many drones at once, there's no way ARC wouldn't know about this person, right?

**T.Goldwell**<br>
If we're to talk about hackers, I have a feeling that Xenon will be brought up again        ~OwO~

**Sopheee**<br>
PAFF just got back and now this happens! <br>
I hope she's alright~

**PrideCr0w**<br>
You should be worrying about yourself first!!!
