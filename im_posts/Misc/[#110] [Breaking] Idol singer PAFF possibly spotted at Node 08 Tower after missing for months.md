> Node 08 idol singer PAFF has been missing for months due to unknown reasons. During her absence, multiple incidents have occurred. From the fans' violent protest regarding Monophonic Entertainment's mistreatment of her disappearance; to the information discovered during the Ã†sir-FEST investigations that linked PAFF's deteriorating health to a possible memory theft she suffered during the incident and more. Just as everyone is about to give up on the search for her, the case took a very surprising and drastic turn today. <br>

> Earlier today, in Node 08 Tower, multiple pedestrians caught sight of PAFF together with well-known streamer NEKO. However, the two quickly passed through the crowd and proceeded to disappear. Only a few witnesses were able to get out their mobile devices in time to capture some blurry photos. We are currently contacting Monophonic Entertainment and the Administration Bureau to confirm the details on this event.<br>

Do they have something to do with Xenon's jailbreak? Are you two the mysterious armed people?

Well, if NEKO uses her gaming skills to control the drones, I can totally picture the havoc she'd cause (in a good way) LMFAO
