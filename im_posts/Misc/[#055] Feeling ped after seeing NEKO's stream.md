The entertainment industry and the record labels are shady-AF<br>
Treating artists like products<br>
Right now, we have no idea what the heck they are up to<br>
They better give us an explanation ASAP

If it's really all a set-up then hot dang is this business shady. PAFF is a living human being, not an item

**CandiceNaoko**<br>
Take NEKO's word with a grain of salt though<br>
Since she has quite the personal vendetta against the company when she left, her comments tend to be more extreme

**Chevalier151**<br>
There is indeed a group of people on-site who are there because of NEKO's stream. They feel the need to teach this company a lesson<br>

**koolboss01**<br>
And yet they ended up targeting the wrong person LOL<br>
All they did was getting an innocent injured. EPIC FAIL

**NotScalper**<br>
I say that the protest is somewhat of a success?? I mean, they should feel the pressure now, I think??

**Srys_lee**<br>
Maybe PAFF has a part in this mess too?

**PaffCheckin**<br>
No comment on this. Had a feeling that nothing good ever happens when Mono is involved
