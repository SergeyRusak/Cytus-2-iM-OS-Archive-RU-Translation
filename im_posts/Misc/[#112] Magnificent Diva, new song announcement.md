Although I don't know why another diva sudden popped out of nowhere<br>
But this... I can wholeheartedly support this~~~~~

I fell in love the first time I heard her music<br>
It has this magical power to lure you in!!!

**STANley**<br>
Woah is this the arrival of the diva era? Can she surpass PAFF??

**CHanatsuka**<br>
How exactly is NEKO doing this lololol<br>
What did she do to net her a collab with a Tier-1 singer like MIKU~?

**vveay**<br>
Saito Production and Monophonic Entertainment, which one is bigger??

**lrrllrrl**<br>
Saito pretty much dominates the market in Node03<br>
They just haven't officially released their stuff in Node08

**JAC-jack**<br>
MIKU! MIKU! MIKU!

**Noposa**<br>
Don't you weebs dare look down on our NEKO!<br>
She earned everything with her true skillz!! 

**HandsomeYi**<br>
Wow a NEKO fan calling someone else a weeb... Look in the mirror first, will ya??<br>
MIKU 4 life!!! I've already saved up the ticket money for the next LIVE!!!

Stop putting out limited editions! RIP my wallet.

The name "Saito Production" sound so... dangerous, for some reason~~~ Like they'll get into a brawl with someone who bumped into them on the streets (I blame the stereotypes~ XDDD

**SYY**<br>
Used to be a PAFF fan, but immediately change sides after hearing MIKU's songs (No regrets
