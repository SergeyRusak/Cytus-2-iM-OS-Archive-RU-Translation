[Stream announcement 09:00 PM God of Work]

Heard that this game is seriously godlike<br>
Has already sweep through countless awards<br>
From the trailer, the combat system looks a bit complicated<br>
If I suck balls in tonight's session, please don't flame me

As with why I decided to stream all of a sudden<br>
Maybe because after watching NEKO stream for so long, it really seems like a fun thing to do<br>
So I decided to give it a try myself too

God of Work sounds unnecessarily epic... What kind of game is it??

**DDStream**<br>
TPS+RPG, you need to train by working in a company, then go out to save the world at night

**HandsomeYi**<br>
Dafuq lololol Whoever thought up this idea is either a madman or a genius lolol

**MYMYM**<br>

Sir, your English teacher would like a word with you. Oh, and he has a knife

**MemeYan**<br>
I previously saw this game on NEKO's wishlist lulz<br>
There's also the Mega Briefcase deluxe edition<br>
Inside, it contains a physical employee badge and the in-game item "Infinite Overtime Coins"

**Noposa**<br>
So you have to achieve a balance between going to work and killing monsters?

**NekoSamurai**<br>
Oh, so our MC is working two extra jobs<br>
Work in the morning, overtime at night, killing monsters for late night

**Pooooon**<br>
I don't want to be this MC...

**Poopytrap**<br>
On top of that, you also have to maintain your relationship with your family. You have to find time to go home, because a broken family is Game Over as well

**C_H_U**<br>
Aren't we playing this game every day? It's called "Life" HAHAHahahahah... I want to cry

**CHanatsuka**<br>
I finished the whole game. Quick tip: just buy tons of Overtime Coins. That's the fastest way to level up

**KirinKiraKira**<br>
I see your grand plan. You're trying to become a streamer so you get to sit next to NEKO in the iM annual party~~~

**Mulder**<br>
I heard that a sequel is already in development

**xxScarlexx**<br>
This game creates some serious inner conflicts when you are playing through it XDD
