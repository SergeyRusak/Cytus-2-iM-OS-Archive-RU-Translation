Why would PAFF collaborate with some nobody... is this some rich brat who wants to ride on her coattails?

I believe something similar happened before?

I remember that. Wasn't it a veteran producer who wants his child to debut? He singlehandedly took care of everything from music to MV to producer...

Maybe his child doesn't want to be in showbiz? Maybe she wanted to be a doctor?
