The agency has dispatched people to find her<br>
The admins have also been involved<br>
A ton of fans should be looking for her too<br>
Yet as of now, we still have absolutely no clue at all??<br>
Don't you find that to be very odd?

I also find this to be really odd<br>
I mean, this is Node 08 after all<br>
All this advanced surveillance system and stuff, yet still nothing at all? 

**Ararar**<br>
If she has a certain level of camouflage technology then maybe it would be hard to find her (?

**Ange3Lina**<br>
Dude, this is PAFF we are talking about, not ConneR

**ElinaDaniel**<br>
If it's ConneR sensei, I feel like he would just knock out every single person who's trying to track him down LOL

**BuddyHat**<br>
Robohead did mention that it would be harder to track her down if it's the suburb area

**BabyHug**<br>
If it's a kidnapping, news about a ransom should appear a long time ago. Could it be that Mono is still hiding something?

**iluvpuf**<br>
At the very least, I hope it's not something terrible QAQ<br>
PAFF, come back\~\~\~\~

**Heart_Head**<br>
Perhaps she took the Xenon route and covered her face with a helmet (?

**m00nl16h7**<br>
Could it be that she has an accomplice?
