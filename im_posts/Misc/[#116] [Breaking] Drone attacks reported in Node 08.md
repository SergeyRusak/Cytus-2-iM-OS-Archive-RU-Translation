If the roads to such shelters have already been blocked, please remain indoors. Do not engage or attempt to fight against the drones.

Does anyone now what's going on?<br>
I heard explosions and screamings. <br>
Should I call the agents? What should I do??????

**EvilForce**<br>
Get you a\*\* moving and go to the shelters ASAP!!!  It's all written up there!! Can you not read the alert?

**SuduMan**<br>
My brother's a Law Enforcement Agent. Does this mean he'll have to fight these drones? <br>
I'm so worried about him...

**kou**<br>
My mom just escaped from the chaos outside. <br>
She said the drones are crashing into pedestrians@@

**Blanky_Blank**<br>
if I need to protect myself, any idea what weapon will be effective??

**Silence_Bob**<br>
Dunno. I don't think they would allow that can hurt drones to be sold publically<br>
Maybe the agents' guns would work???

**T3RA_wr47h**<br>
Does the Bureau still have drones to deploy? Using drones to fight drones might just be the way to go@@!

**Popo**<br>
Has ARC's private security army been deployed yet? <br>
Aren't they the experts in dealing with these things?

**Neon_raven**<br>
One of them just crash landed into my building's courtyard... <br>
Luckily I live way up on a much higher floor.<br>
(ΩДΩ) So scared 0rz

Please be careful up there\~ Not the time to move around now...

Posting to report my safety. There didn't seem to be any incidents reported in my area... so far<br>
Must be because this place is so remote that not even the drones can locate it lol

**9tingale**<br>
Isnt reporting on this a bit dangerous? I'd much rather the reporters get the heck out of there than see them report on this...

**Poopytrap**<br>
My waifu NEKO... Is she okay????? I can give her my space here at the shelter!!!

**NekoSamurai**<br>
Idiot. She'll get killed on the way to your home. Don't be stupid

**Mick_Rorty**<br>
BTW, I just realize how ubiquitous drones are. They really are f\*\*\*\*\* everywhere! You never notice that until s\*\*\* like this happens

**Wickedragon**<br>

**vveay**<br>

**Pascal626**<br>

Folks, do not overreact to false information. The emergency news reports are just to prevent the situation from getting out of control. Nothing more.
