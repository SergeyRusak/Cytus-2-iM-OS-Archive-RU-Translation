> The series of internet terrorist attacks related to the infamous Æsir-FEST has been the talk of the Node. Prime suspect Simon Jackson (Internet ID: Xenon) was arrested a few days ago. Despite refusing to explain his involvement with the cases at first, after several nights of interrogation, we've received information that he has finally given up and pleaded guilty, stating that he is indeed the mastermind behind everything: Æsir.<br>
> <br>
> According to an anonymous source from within the Administration Bureau, Simon Jackson stated during interrogation: " Under a condition where a certain purpose exists in the subconscious, I may have used my computer technology skills to convert the theoretical thought of stealing memories into practical actions. Even though my memory is still in a rather chaotic state, I will not rule out the possibility that I fabricated this Æsir identity and used it to commit criminal acts."<br>
> <br>
> The source also points out that the higher-ups at A.R.C., where Simon Jackson is previously employed at, have also dispatched key figures to assist the Administration Bureau in acquiring more evidence. This is also to ensure that there are no hidden accomplices or other potentially dangerous factors that may lead to another incident.<br>

Night night fanboys and fangirls. GG for you all~~~

Why does the second paragraph feel like some bureaucratic mumbo jumbo??

**noneXenon**<br>
Is it possible that he's forced to plead guilty

**Wrinkleheart**<br>
Is it just me, or does this feel like the admins are in a hurry to get this case over with?? It all seems too easy

**AngryMan**<br>
So he wanted to test out his abilities thus decided to use the entire city's brains as his lab rats?

**11IIll11**<br>
I heard that Xenon participated in the establishment of many of the virtual internet's regulations<br>
Maybe, just maybe... they are filled with loopholes he inserted himself~~~~~~

**NEKOSAIKOU**<br>
RUN GUYS, RUNNNNN~~~~~~~

It's so hard to imagine what the usually cool Xenon would look like when he pleaded guilty<br>
Probably pretty emotionless

**fotoistruth**<br>
Or... maybe it's the complete opposite and he's a sobbing mess on the floor...

**USurBrain**<br>
Just how many "insiders" are there for the media???<br>
In theory, shouldn't this be investigative information that is not yet revealed to the public LMFAO

Anonymous source... Unless a proper source is named, nobody's gonna believe this BS
