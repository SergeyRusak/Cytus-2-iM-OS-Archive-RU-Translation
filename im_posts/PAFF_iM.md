Must be because PAFF works really hard! That's why she gets acknowledged by the judges. The sales are gonna go through the roof.

Disgusting, very disgusting

**AngryFan**<br>

Definitely not a PUFFER, we know our place!

I feel like we need to single him out. The admins are probably going to give him a non\-prosecution or something and let him off scot\-free. What if he does it again?

**PAFF-Official**<br>
We would like fellow little Puffs to calm down. We don't do anything illegal!

**CeLiA**<br>
Must know your own place

**Lynx87**<br>
He keeps yelling that he is PAFF's friend, is he nuts or what?

Arrest him! Arrest him! Arrest him!

**maplewing**<br>
Cuff him! Cuff him! Cuff him!

**SancTityKnight**<br>
Any updates?

**vvv_IRIS_vvv**<br>
Seems like it's not a fan, just some crazy dude

**iluvpuf**<br>
Wasn't that guy already arrested

**Chevalier151**<br>
So it's now up to the admins? I feel like he needs to feel the rage of the fans...

**An0nym0us**<br>
Can someone post the footage? The news footage is blurry and unrecognizable. Someone should have a clearer version.

We would like fellow fans to calm down. We will update you accordingly.

Greeting fellow fans. I am Helena, PAFF's agent. 

PAFF is now awake. Her condition is stable, but to be absolutely certain that she is fine, we will be staying at the hospital for a few more days to do a complete check\-up.

I have to be honest, I really panicked when PAFF collapsed during last night's event. Not as an agent, but as PAFF's sister and only family. 

Due to my inability to handle the chaotic venue and comfort the fans, the situation got really messy. I apologize for my mistakes. I am really sorry. 

Many of you may know that PAFF suffered a serious accident before she debuted. The accident caused severe damage to her brain, so please don't blame her for the incident today. 

PAFF is a very shy child. I know that because I grew up with her. Her devotion to fans and her efforts to try communicating with this world through music, I've witnessed it all with my own eyes. 

I would like fans to not abandon her due to her physical shortcomings. Besides music, your support is the only thing that keeps her going.

For remaining with her and supporting her through all these times, I am deeply grateful. All of you, thank you so much!

PAFF is slowly getting herself back into shape. Everyone, please continue to root for her.

Recently the agent has been watching PAFF very closely, since she is always trying to secretly practice singing. Even virtual simulation training is off limits for her now!

Tomorrow is the routine return check\-up. We believe that the doctor will see PAFF's improvements!

Link is completely dead. The so\-called "available 24/7" customer service system also have not responded at all. Available 24/7? More like absolute trash 24/7!!!

**Poopytrap**<br>
Dude, do you have too much money to throw at random crap? Maybe this is all a scam ya know

**vvv_IRIS_vvv**<br>
Mono officials, any announcements regarding the Æsir\-FEST incident?

**AbbEE**<br>
My god that's right<br>
Mono should know about Æsir\-FEST too<br>
Since they agreed to let PAFF be a guest performer

**koolboss01**<br>
Does your company want to give an explanation for ANYTHING

**CeLiA**<br>
This is not the Mono I used to know...

**HC**<br>
Calm down everybody. If you think about it, there's nothing wrong with how they are dealing with this

**AngryFan**<br>
Do you think that refunds will solve everything!!!?

**m00nl16h7**<br>
Where's Mono's CEO?<br>
Are you setting up a press conference to apologize for this mess?

**Chevalier151**<br>
Idiots refund is the only way they can handle a situation like this. What else are they gonna do

**IronFan**<br>
I'm so disappointed. I will not support you guys anymore in the future

**Mohito**<br>
Even though the news reports say that Æsir\-FEST was held, I still couldn't piece together my schedule that day

**NotScalper**<br>
It's great that we can ask for a refund. I bought 15 general admission tickets

**SuduMan**<br>
You must be a ticket scalper, right?

**PaffCheckin**<br>
I just paid a visit to the physical store locations around that area<br>
They said that they didn't receive any instructions from HQ<br>
Do you really have any intention to handle this situation properly?

**StuffyMouth**<br>
Don't really want to support Mono's events from now on. SkyEkho might be the better choice. They may be a smaller company, but look at the work they did with ConneR's concert; it was f\*\*\*\*\* awesome

Dear little Puffs, do you remember the rookie band **@Cherry PuNK** who composed a song for PAFF \~\~

Originally, PAFF was scheduled to participate in the Tower 054 new floor "108" 's opening celebration event. However, since she is still not feeling well, she is unable to be present at the event herself. She will be talking with everyone through a pre\-recorded video. Monophonic Entertainment also invited Cherry PuNK to be at the event as special guests!

After hearing that they will be performing in place of the still recovering PAFF, the members of Cherry PuNK have been practicing really hard. Everyone, please remember to acknowledge them and give them a huge round of applause!

**Paffy**<br>
Just happen to be watching the rehearsal clip, for some reason PAFF just feels kinda...off?

**SuduMan**<br>
How so?

**Paffy**<br>
She looks like she's in good spirits, but it doesn't really match the description the officials gave us a while ago. Like she's supposed to be resting, but it just doesn't look that way

**Paffy**<br>
Also I'm getting some serious Déjà vu from some of the things she said. You guys help me figure this out:<br>
"Thank you to everyone for their support. I'm fine, nothing really serious" and " I hope that everyone is not affected by the false rumors out there. Please trust the agency's announcements"

**iluvpuf**<br>
Weren't these the things she said about a year ago on a Mono press conference explaining her "dating" rumors?

**maplewing**<br>
Dude why do you remember crap like this so clearly lol

**Paffy**<br>
OMG you're right! I just found the clip; it's exactly the same. Everything, from the expressions to the words, is the same!!!!!

To our dear fans and precious customers,

PAFF (Real name: Aroma White), an artist who is currently under contract with us, left the hospital she was resting at on the night of September 9th without notice and has been missing since. As of today, her agent, the agency, and other colleagues have been unable to make any kind of contact with her. 

Here, I would like to first thank all the fans and our friends in the media for your understanding. Monophonic Entertainment chose to not explain the actual situation to the public when the incident first broke out due to an attempt to protect the privacy and rights of our artists. We have tried our best to search and investigate, in hopes that PAFF can contact us herself and explain the situation. However, we haven't made any notable progress. We are in the same position as everyone is right now: we know the fact PAFF has gone missing for no reason, but we don't know any details. More investigation is still required. 

We are essentially PAFF's closest family when it comes to her business. As our business blooms, we grow together. We had hope that PAFF could contact us herself during this time period; unfortunately, things didn't work out as we expected. Please allow us to sincerely apologize to all our fans and the public for our actions in the past few weeks. We are very, very sorry. 

We also hope that everyone can help us locate the whereabouts of PAFF. If you have any hints, please contact us. Sincerely<br>
Chris Carpenter<br>
Monophonic Entertainment CEO

**TunaLee**<br>
Not a very clean wash imo

Seriously how long has it been and NOW you're asking for help<br>
What if something really bad actually happened to her? Who's responsibility is that!!!??????????????

**SancTityKnight**<br>
PAFF please be OK!!!

**Poopytrap**<br>
Leaving without notice all of a sudden is so worrying...

**StuffyMouth**<br>
I truly feel that asking for a refund was one of the best decisions I ever made in my life

**An0nym0us**<br>
We've been saying, "Not surprised, it's Mono" for years<br>
Well, look what we have now<br>
"Surprise, Muthaf\*\*\*er!"

**koolboss01**<br>
I don't give a flying f\*\*\* about your apology statement. Fix your damn refund system first!!

**CeLiA**<br>
I don't think an apology statement can save this mess now

**HC**<br>
If she's been missing for so long, could it be a kidnapping??

**lenba**<br>
So worried about PAFF >"< what should I do

**TobeTobe**<br>
If it's really a kidnapping they would've informed the police a long time ago ok. Only thing Mono didn't want was to blow this out of proportion; no way they ignore PAFF's safety

**Chevalier151**<br>
Hey, I've been wanting to boycott Mono since the beginning. Anybody care to join me now?

**IronFan**<br>
We should go protest at Mono headquarters<br>
Did they really think that all fans are nerds who don't go outside

**Mohito**<br>
You just exposed yourself lul

**NotScalper**<br>
What's wrong with being a nerd? We go outside too

**SuduMan**<br>
So Mono's been looking for her all this time to no avail and is finally asking for help now<br>
Looks like they thought too highly of themselves before?

**PaffCheckin**<br>
Yep hand washing indeed. Keeping themselves squeaky clean

**StuffyMouth**<br>
So worried about her safety<br>
If everyone works together we should find her in no time

Let me interpret this for everyone:<br>
Hello<br>
PAFF got lost, even though she's an adult<br>
We can't do anything about it as well<br>
You can't blame the agency<br>
Because we are only responsible for making money with PAFF<br>
We are not responsible for being her GPS

After the agency's statement, I feel that I should officially apologize to everyone here as well. 

Regarding the concealing of PAFF's situation. I understand that everyone is worried, panicked and angry. I am very sorry.

Since the incident really just came out of nowhere, I had no idea what to do as well. After discussing with the agency, we came to the conclusion that we should stay low for a while and see how things play out. Meanwhile, the agency immediately dispatched people to search for PAFF as well. 

This has been a very difficult time for me and other people who care about PAFF. We don't know why she suddenly decided to vanish, but I believe that right now she is in a state that needs us by her side the most. I truly hope that everyone can help us look for PAFF. If you have any information, feel free to tell me directly through this account. 

Last but not least, thank you for reading this entire post. I don't expect anyone to forgive me for what I've done, but I do at least hope that you can understand the struggles and sadness I experienced as her sister during this time. Monophonic Entertainment<br>

To our dear fans and beloved customers,

For the past few days, Monophonic Entertainment has been at the center of a serious conflict. The situation has taken a turn for the worse, as a fellow Monophonic Entertainment artist was violently attacked and suffered physical injuries earlier today. These incidents have severely harmed the company's reputation and our employee's safety. They are also chipping away at the positive relationship this company has built with the fans throughout the years.

To fellow fans who are surrounding the Monophonic Entertainment Headquarters right now, we sincerely hope that you can have a proper and peaceful conversation with the Monophonic PR team that will be present on\-site very soon. Your feedback and opinions are always the most important thing to us. 

We believe that only reasonable and calm conversation can lead to a path of mutual understanding. 

Sincerely<br>
Monophonic Entertainment

**PAFF-Official**<br>
To our dear fans and beloved customers,

Monophonic Entertainment Inc. signed Miss Aroma White to a contract back in 695. For the past seven years, ever since her performance debut under the name "PAFF", we have always treated everything regarding Miss White with the highest possible standards. We always try our best to give fellow fans the best experience.

After Miss White went missing without notice, we have also tried our utmost to search for her and handle the losses. However, her action is indeed a violation of her contract and has already caused the company a substantial amount of damage, including property damage, other contract artists getting injured and more. In addition, it has led to the mistrust between fellow fans and the company, something neither of us wants to see happen. 

Therefore, we hereby announce the following information to fellow fans and friends in the media: After taking all issues into consideration, we have reached an agreement with Miss White's agent, Miss Helena White. We will be terminating the contract between Monophonic Entertainment Inc. and Miss Aroma White, effective immediately. We will no longer be responsible for her future career as an artist. 

We wish Miss White the best of luck in her future. We will continue to work hard to create the highest quality of performance experience. We hope that fellow fans can continue supporting our other artists.

Sincerely<br>
Monophonic Entertainment
