Hi, I'm Cherry. Thank you to everyone for their passion during yesterday's performance<br>
LUMY has been saying that it's my turn to write a thank-you post, but I was so tired yesterday that I was out cold the instant I got home... I am so sorry!

For yesterday's Encore song, I sang Crystal PuNK's old song "Still"<br>
Since this is a rare opportunity, I would like to talk a little bit about this song<br>
This is a song written during the CP (Crystal PuNK) days by Simon (a.k.a. Xenon)<br>
It's also a song that I really, really love. The concept behind this song is as follows:

 "In everyone's lives, there's always fear that we dread to confront.<br>
 No matter how many friends we have, every person is still an independent individual.<br>
 No matter how close we are to another person, we can't expect them to fully understand our pressure and anxiety.<br>
 In most cases, we are the only ones who can truly feel the pain, and we have to confront it alone.

 But this is exactly why we should try to understand that every life is a different story<br>
 Even though they may not feel your pain,<br>
 they just might be carrying an equally, perhaps even heavier burden that you don't understand. <br>
 The most important thing of all is to conjure up the courage to overcome your own fears, <br>
 and cherish those who are willing to stay by your side even if they don't fully understand you.

 Here's to hope that this song can bring courage to those who are fighting their own unique battles"

Haven't seen Xenon a lot these days

Probably dealing with the AEsir case

**xxScarlexx**<br>
That case was so freaky. Tend to stay away from chip surfing now``
