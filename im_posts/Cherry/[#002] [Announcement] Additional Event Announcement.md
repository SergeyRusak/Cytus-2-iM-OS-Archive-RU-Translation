[Announcement]<br>
This week, the "Floor 108 Opening Celebration Event" held at Quadrant III's Tower 054 has invited Cherry PuNK for a special performance. Come and celebrate this occasion with us! (The event is completely free!)

Time: 702/09/15 PM 03:00 ~ PM 04:30

Originally plan to participate in this event, **@PAFF-Official** couldn't make it because of her physical conditions. The members also feel terribly sorry for fellow PUFFERs.

However, PAFF recorded a holo-recreation and she has a message for everyone. We would like fellow fans to come and support PAFF with us!

That day, one of our new songs in the new album we are working on will also be performed for the first time. Please look forward to it!

Let's go and cheer for PAFF!!

**iHatepuf**<br>
It seems like all this band does is using PAFF to promote themselves... disgusting

**Xzavis**<br>
Yeah, feels like they're taking advantage of a patient

**CherryMyLife**<br>
Shut up you cream Puffs. ChP rose to fame by their own strength and music ok? They will be fine even without Mono

**Fuxkoff**<br>
Oh yeah? Then why won't they f\*\*\*off and go back to being an underground band? Stop riding on PAFF's coattails

**M3rmaid**<br>
What's with these petty arguments... music is music, who gives a damn about whether it's underground or not? Everybody please calm down ok?<br>

Will Cherry be singing Crystal PuNK's songs this time? Heard it last time, been wanting to hear it live again since >\_

**CherryPuNK**<br>
Yes, she said that she will at least sing "Still"<br>

**Varinaya**<br>
Can't agree with you more.

**Shibawu**<br>
Yeah, these idiots are like boohoo she fainted, now nobody can make music because she's in a coma. WHAT THE ACTUAL F\*\*\* do they think they are???
