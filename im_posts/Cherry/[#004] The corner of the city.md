Has anyone been to Quadrant I?<br>
That's an area where very few people live or even talk about now<br>
A while ago, I paid the area a visit to draw some inspiration<br>
After seeing the scenery there, it just feels like it doesn't belong to this city<br>
Everything is so quiet and motionless, despite the fact that the bustling city is only a few blocks away

When I was a child, my father always told me that there are things we frankly couldn't understand<br>
A long time ago, the Architects left behind all this and disappeared without a trace

There will always be that day, where we come across the departure of our loved ones<br>
It's inevitable, like the rotation of this planet

Maybe we'll be living every day carefully and worried because of that<br>
Maybe we've gone through this situation time and time again in our hearts<br>
Maybe, we are just not prepared to confront those that are about to leave

Cherry's really sentimental today QQ

**CHanatsuka**<br>
I live right across the bridge, the only thing I don't like is the ARC's carriers passing by every morning. God they are loud...

**DustyAsh**<br>
It's pretty dangerous there isn't it? The admins sealed off a lot of places it seems

**MirriLL**<br>
Yeah, it's said that there are a lot of broken and unusable facilities in there

**iWanttobelieve**<br>
Maybe the Architects are some outside space aliens?

**iAMneet**<br>
Outside space aliens.... sounds like something the NEETs would hate LMFAO

**Cantspell**<br>
Jusy got dumped by my girlfreind ... this post jit me right in the frels......

**aidan**<br>
Maybe you got dumped because you don't know how to use the frickin autocorrect

**Axroid_Sona**<br>
A while ago my MeowBot also jumped off a building, I was so sad...

**D33M0**<br>
Wait what?? What the heck happened lol?

**DoctorWhere**<br>
That area is super mysterious. So many urban legends were created there @ @

**vikisser**<br>
Wait are we talking about urban legends!? Then it's time to **@ROBO\_Head** XD

**ROBO_Head**<br>
Analysis: Node 08 civilian active areas average less than 5% of the entire Node<br>
Conclusion: Rumors about Quadrant I believability: Extremely low.

**KiwaHu**<br>
What does that even mean Robo? It just looks like gibberish to me XDDD

**KoraKora**<br>
The only thing it proves is that there really is nobody living there LOL

**ZigZag**<br>
Hold on a minute, is 5% the right number? Is Node08 really THAT massive??? lololol

**AvaJaKeLon**<br>
It is actually. There are many places where most people won't even go near<br>
Also if you live in the Tower, one Tower is a pretty sufficient area for daily activities<br>
Some people probably never left the Tower before they became an adult

**iSEEu**<br>
Are you sure it's for inspiration? A few days ago someone caught a shot of Cherry catching a motorcycle ride with Xenon again ROFL

**w_Rosabel_w**<br>
Stop spreading unconfirmed fake rumors ok = =

**iSEEu**<br>
If you don't believe me, just do a quick search in the gossip blocks. The photo is right there

**SuperKY**<br>
S\*\*\* so does that mean the Xenon two-timing stuff is real?

**Gearz_Igo**<br>
Dude, there was never proof that Xenon and NEKO were actually dating, so stop making stupid assumptions...

**Shipper**<br>
And it's not like a single photo's gonna prove anything. I myself hope this is the sign of a possible CP comeback XD

**Fuxkoff**<br>
**@Xenon** Didn't your post say that you'll be offering everything to help deal with internet security? Turns out you're too busy dealing with girls lolololol

**NekoSamurai**<br>
So... has NEKO been released yet...??

**KirinKiraKira**<br>
From what I heard, it appears that she was already acquitted
