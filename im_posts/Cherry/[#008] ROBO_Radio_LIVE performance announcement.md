Cherry:<br>
Hello everyone<br>
I have some good news that I want to share with everybody

I am honored to receive an invitation from  **@ROBO\_Head**<br>
and will be performing on the ROBO\_Radio\_LIVE hosted by him

Having the opportunity to perform on a new stage,<br>
collaborating with other amazing artists, and singing for new friends<br>
I feel truly blessed

We stand by each other's side, not just through the internet, but in life as well<br>
As the music and singing flows<br>
whether it's on the stage or off the stage, our hearts can always be closely connected

I hope I can spend this time together with all of you<br>
Thank you

But I didn't see any news about this on the Mono official website. That's so rare

**CherryPuNK**<br>
This performance will be a personal event for Cherry.<br>
It's is not a part of Cherry PuNK's contract with Mono<br>
However, the other band members (me included) is ready to cheer her on in the audience!

Hahaha All the artists are so supportive of Cherry<br>
Whether it's current or previous band members, friends will always be friends<br>
This type of comradery between artists is amazing

**Rob_Oto**<br>
Beware of Mono's ultimate move... Contract termination from the most minute of issues<br>
**\#PrayForPAFF**

**KiwaHu**<br>
Can't help but think back to Æsir-FEST. That's also an event hosted by a DJ... Robo probably won't brainwash us right? At least that's what I hoped (((；ﾟДﾟ))))

**SuduMan**<br>
This group can totally brainwash everyone with just their music!! I'm so excited about this!!!
