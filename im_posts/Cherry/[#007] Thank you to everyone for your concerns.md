Hello everyone

Cherry here<br>
Allow me to show my gratitude to everyone who was concerned about me<br>
I've been discharged from the hospital yesterday<br>
Thanks to the proper treatment of the doctors, I'm feeling very well now

Held a little celebration party with my band members<br>
They've been teasing me about being the first artist to ever end up in a hospital by simply going to work<br>
Can't blame them though; you don't find a lead vocalist who's this unlucky everyday

However, I don't blame anybody. I really do understand why the fans are so emotionally fired-up for this incident<br>
The incidents and people I've come across lately <br>
have led me to the realization, that if it was me who lost something I treasured<br>
I certainly won't be able to keep myself under control

Through this incident<br>
I had the opportunity to take a short break and think about some things

The distance between people have been getting larger by the minute<br>
However, we still breathe and live under the same starry sky<br>
It was in the past, it is now, and it will certainly continue into the future too

Hope that I can put such emotions into my songs<br>
and continue to sing them for you guys<br>
Thank you

Vocalist\_Cherry

Was indifferent towards you before, starting to like you more as I read this post. Keep fighting

Good to hear that you're well! Welcome back!!!

Wait a sec, upon second look, why does this post have a "getting back together" feel to it...???

**TorF**<br>
Told you that the relationship levels are going to gradually increase<br>
I predict an official announcement coming in about 2 months LOL

**CHanatsuka**<br>
Why are there dumb comments like this on a proper situation update?<br>
Take your BS somewhere else; leave Cherry alone

Cherry, have you read about the latest news report from 08 Daily<br>
Maybe you still don't know the true colors of POS Xenon

**Fuxkoff**<br>
X's facade is about to be exposed very soon... I suggest you keep your distance Cherry

You're the best because you aren't affected by all the static noises. I look forward to seeing your time arrive

Big sis! If you're out of the hospital, come have a drink! Oh, BTW, pay your bills from last time as well
