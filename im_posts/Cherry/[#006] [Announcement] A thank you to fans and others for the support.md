[Announcement]<br>
Hello everyone<br>
We have an emergency announcement to make<br>
Earlier today, our lead voaclist Cherry was entering the Monophonic Entertainment headquarters building when she was accidently caught in the violent actions of the protesters.<br>
She suffered multiple scrapping wounds on her elbows and calves. She also experienced symptoms of dizziness, possibly due to the excessive force she was pushed with<br>
 <br>
Fortunately, under the escort of the security team,<br>
she was sent to the hospital on time and got proper treatment<br>
As of now, she is through with her treatment and is now resting<br>
 <br>
A big thank you to fellow fans and others for your support<br>
After Cherry gets better after a few days' rest<br>
we will let her address everyone herself<br>

F\*\*\*! Enough of this BS! Can we find out who did it?

**MYMYM**<br>
It's probably going to be difficult, as the site was really chaotic

**Hatehate**<br>
Cream Puffs going nuts

**Paf_Paf**<br>
Bro, don't you dare insult all of PAFF fans<br>
 Most of us are still very reasonable about this incident

**KOSOMA**<br>
OMG why did it turned out like this @@

**KiwaHu**<br>
Thank goodness it’s just scrapping wounds… I hope she doesn't have a concussion?

**Mecha_Giga**<br>
WTH are these a\*\*holes thinking!!!<br>
What’s the point of getting innocent people involved??

**Strawcherry**<br>
Cherry, take your time and rest well

**KiwaHu**<br>
Treat your wounds carefully; you don’t want an infection

**Don0van**<br>
\*Whisper\* Can I ask which hospital she is in…?

**M3rmaid**<br>
Why aren't the admins doing something?<br>
Can’t you just arrest all of them?

**JAC-jack**<br>
A lot of people are just there to cause trouble imo

**RockLover**<br>
Why would they attack Cherry? She has nothing to do with this

**WUT**<br>
Isn't PAFF kinda responsible as well??????

**m00nl16h7**<br>
If you wanna blame, blame Mono for not dealing with their s\*\*\* better<br>
