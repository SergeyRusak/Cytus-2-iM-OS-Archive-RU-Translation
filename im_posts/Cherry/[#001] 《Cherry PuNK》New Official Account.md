CherryPuNK:<br>
Hi! We are the next-gen band《Cherry PuNK》!

From now on, all official event announcements and the daily lives of the members will be posted on this account<br>
The old account will likely not be updated anymore (I think)<br>
If you follow the old account, please remember to transfer to this one~

To those who don't know about us yet:<br>
We are a two-year-old independent Rock/Post-Rock band from Node 08.<br>
Our members include lead vocalist and guitar - Cherry/ Bass - Frank/ Keyboard - LUMY/ Drums - Dannis<br>
This year, we are very honored to receive the invitation from Monophonic Entertainment to join this big family.<br>
We are currently working on our first album after we joined (Our previous EPs are also available at Monophonic's marketplace)<br>
In the future, we will work with the company and bring everyone more amazing events and performances.<br>
Looking forward to meeting everyone~

So Cherry's becoming a superstar now~ Don't forget me... Q\_Q

**CherryPuNK**<br>
**@aasdd** Ha! Don't be ridiculous

**NEKOSAIKOU**<br>
It's the band that **@NEKO\#ΦωΦ** recommended a lot!! Must support!!<br>
But look out though, since Mono is shady-AF LOLOL

**D33M0**<br>
Mono's commission fee is brutal, why would you join it...

**w_Rosabel_w**<br>
Followed \\m/

**Pumpkinforest**<br>
It's not a bad thing to get more exposure though. Mono's marketing team has a pretty good track record

**Bit_Inex**<br>
Agreed. This band is awesome; it just never got the recognition it deserves lulz

**TreeNoAlice**<br>
If not for the collaboration with PAFF a while ago, I wouldn't have known this band. Music is very solid

**Lynx87**<br>
Mono give PAFF back, you a\*\*holes! ˋˊ

**CrystalP**<br>
\\Any Crystal fans here/

**Crys_Forever**<br>
Still prefer the old style though...

**KiwaHu**<br>
Will the data from the old account stay there? I really like to visit that account to see recreations of your performances!

**CherryPuNK**<br>
**@KiwaHu** Yes. It's just that there won't be new posts~ the data there will gradually be transferred to this account too

Node 08 rock's only ray of hope

**CyberLord**<br>
Did you forget about Xenon? ROFL

**noneXenon**<br>
Xenon is more Metalcore, ok? They are two completely different styles

**LyLah1207**<br>
Can't stand the screaming

**WuGuChicken**<br>
They're two sides of the same coin, no point arguing
