Goodnight everybody

Cherry here<br>
Just now, after hearing from friends and seeing the sudden burst of messages in my inbox, <br>
I finally discovered that I was targeted by a gossip magazine

Right now, Xenon and I are simply old friends<br>
Fans who have followed us since the Crystal PuNK days should understand this very clearly<br>
Even though the band disbanded, all the members are still in contact with each other

We originally had plans to meet each other that day<br>
Going to the LED office to pick up his friend was a complete afterthought<br>
That day was also my first time meeting the streamer NEKO

Regarding other false accusations in the magazine<br>
The Xenon I know is definitely not someone who would indulge in illegal activities<br>
Hope everyone can respect other people's privacy and avoid baseless speculations<br>
Even though we are public figures, we would still like some breathing room

Thank you

Cherry is so awesome, will support you

Cherry you don't have to be chained by things in the past<br>
It's more important to look towards the future :))

**Gogossip**<br>
Are you really gonna say that there's NOTHING between you two?

**iHatepuf**<br>
Such immature actions, man these young internet celebrities

**moonin**<br>
The entertainment industry has always been a hot mess LOL

**Grimwood**<br>
OH hey look what we have here: some fossils XD

**TorF**<br>
Common thing to do now is to say we're friends<br>
Then as more evidence surface, the relationship levels will gradually increase

**Shibawu**<br>
So WTF does that have to do with you? It's their life; what they do is none of your business

Recent issues of 08 Daily are getting more and more exciting<br>
They finally start to grasp the taste of young readers~

Node 08 rock's only ray of hope, please hold strong~~~

Don't really like Xenon, too many secrets<br>
If a man is not open about himself it's always suspicious

**M3rmaid**<br>
If Cherry really wanted a boyfriend, I feel like she could easily nail a better option out there

**moonin**<br>
Cherry said that they are not dating now<br>
What kind of problem do you idiots have

**CherryMyLife**<br>
If Cherry decided to sue the worthless magazine, I will support you!!!

**RockLover**<br>
The recent sales of 08 Daily have surpassed Pineapple Weekly and Hex Magazine

Wow Cherry backing up Xenon in her own statement
