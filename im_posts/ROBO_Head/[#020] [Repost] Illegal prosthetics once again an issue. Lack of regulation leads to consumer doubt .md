> Another accident caused by illegal prosthetics, this time in Node 08's Quadrant III industrial area. A man suddenly went berserk at work. The pistons in his prosthetic right arm began to move on their own, attacking nearby colleagues and security guards that arrived on site to stop him. The accident left one dead and twelve injured.<br>
> <br>
> According to the official investigation, the man's prosthetic arm was purchased from the black market and is an illegally produced, defective product. The neural chips in the arm cause brain damage to the user. The chips may also experience short-circuits and overcharge when the user's emotions are unstable. Node 08 Administration Bureau's medical committee urges the public to only use officially approved, safe prosthetics to prevent similar incidents from happening again. <br>
