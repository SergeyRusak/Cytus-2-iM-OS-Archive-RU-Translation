[Technology][News][ARC][A.I.]<br>
> The Institute of Ancient Ruin Civilization (A.R.C.) announced at their routine dinner party that they will be releasing an interactive software that allows the public to simulate exploration in the forbidden areas. This software is available for download at the A.R.C. official site. In addition, A.R.C. is scheduled to make a huge announcement at an upcoming press conference. Inside sources told us that the topic of this announcement will be on AI and its interaction with human emotions. <br>

My uncle also works at A.R.C. HQ, but I heard his work is dangerous and he must go to the forbidden areas regularly

I think A.R.C. is larger than the admins in Node08. It's the other way around here in Node13

Here we call A.R.C. the "real" admins : )
