Æsir was indeed on stage! OH MY freakin GOD~~~

**Flower_Head**<br>
this is way beyond "Information Security", is it the end of the world!?

**Andy_Roid**<br>
So can we now confirm that the culprit here uses the same method as the one in the NEKO incident?

Affirmative.

Great, two major terrorist attacks by some godlike hacker in Node08, millions affected yet the admins are doing jack s\*\*\*...

Reported to Administration Bureau

**Heart_Head**<br>
Who did it, was Æsir a victim as well?

**Talus_Alpha**<br>
What if Æsir is the perpetrator himself...\*runs away\*

**Esox_tron**<br>
Æsir, like NEKO, completely vanished from the web after the incident, so he should not be the mastermind behind this, right?
