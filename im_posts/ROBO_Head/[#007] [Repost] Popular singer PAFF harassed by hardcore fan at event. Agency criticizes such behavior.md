PAFF, while shaken, did not suffer any physical harm. <br>

Excess white noise in audio file

Aw that's unfortunate, but man ROBO\_head you really CAN do everything

**Farland**<br>
I was pretty close to PAFF, the man kept yelling the same words. A dialect of some sort? or a name?

**SuduMan**<br>
Maybe some kind of curse \*shudders\*

**An0nym0us**<br>
Stuff like this freak me out. God know who will be the next victim

**KarenMayako**<br>
Best wishes for PAFF, hope she is not frightened >"
