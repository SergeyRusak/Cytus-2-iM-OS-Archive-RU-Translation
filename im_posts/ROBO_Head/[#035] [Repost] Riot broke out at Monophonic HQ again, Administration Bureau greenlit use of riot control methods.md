> Following the incident a few days ago where angry fans surrounded Monophonic Entertainment Headquarters, a second riot erupted today. This one is largely believed to be related to Monophonic Entertainment's announcement of its contract termination with missing idol singer PAFF. Most fans viewed this as an act of evading responsibility, thus leading to today's incident. <br>
> <br>
> Earlier today, fans voluntarily gathered in front of the building once again. According to the analysis by the drone, the crowd this time expanded much faster than last time. This fast-growing mob quickly jammed the entire traffic network around the site. The furious fans nearly caused the entire situation to go out of control. Fortunately, the Administration Bureau deployed squadrons of law enforcement agents and riot control drones in time to prevent the worst from happening. Using high-velocity water streams, the agents were able to drive away the rioting crowd and arrest 12 suspects for excessive behavior, finally putting an end to the riot. <br>
> <br>
> Monophonic Entertainment later issued a statement regarding this incident. In addition to thanking the Administration Bureau for their timely and efficient help, they also expressed their grief for the actions of the rioting fans. They also restated their point, that Monophonic Entertainment has communicated with PAFF's agent, Helena White, about all the details regarding the contract termination. The two sides reached a peaceful and mutual agreement before the decision was made public. It was not an attempt to evade responsibility, which is what many people outside of the company have suspected. <br>
> <br>
> During the suppression, several dozen citizens got injured, mostly due to slipping on the wet surface. Even though no significant injuries were filed, this is still one of the larger physical protests in recent years. The Administration Bureau has treated this issue with extra care. According to several sources, the Bureau plans to form a special investigation team to research countermeasures. On top of that, since the iM system was used as a platform to organize such activities, the Bureau also plans to involve A.R.C., the administrators of the virtual city cyTus, into the discussions to prevent similar incidents from occurring again.<br>

Decision: Possibility of another protest within a week: 42%

**AaA**<br>
Much lower than what I expected. The admins know how to do their job well

**BbB**<br>
Don't say it in such a casual manner!<br>
I just happen to pass by there a few minutes ago. The site is utter chaos! So many people were pinned on the ground by the law enforcement agents. Some of them even have their entire face covered in blood; it's really frightening

**DuskDawn**<br>
You reap what you sow. They have only themselves to blame for getting involved with this mess

**An0nym0us**<br>
You people don't understand how we felt! We just wanted some justice!<br>

Oh hey! We have a survivor. How does prison food taste XD

**NerdBuster**<br>
Causing others trouble in the real world for something on the internet; if that's not stupidly childish I don't know what is

If I were to make a guess, all of those people are probably weebs living in their mother's basement while feeding on D\*\*itos and M\*\*\*tain Dew (Ok, maybe an occasional Chinese food takeout)

**Tracix**<br>
Wait wat? It was normal in the first part; why did the second part become a meme fiesta LMFAO

**RamenBot**<br>
Speaking of Chinese food, I think the admins should get rid of the water streams<br>
They should spray people with s\*\*\* instead. I guarantee you it will be super effective against the rioters

**Marshall**<br>
We would like ARC to devote their resources in developing quantum poo spraying drones

**beeeeeeeeee**<br>
The heck? Am I reading this right? WTF is quantum poo?????? ROFL

**AAAnton**<br>
Please focus the research on making quantum poo scatter through the quantum field via quantum radiation in order to achieve the maximum quantum spread and release quantum smell particles to quickly disperse the protesting crowd

**KiwaHu**<br>
Another mention of the word "quantum" and I'm going to have you f\*\*\*\*\* murdered!<br>
LMAO<br>
**@ROBO\_Head** Tell him to stop it!

**ROBO_Head**<br>
Note: Analyze technology viability of forming quasi-human feces with the application of Quantum Physics

**CHanatsuka**<br>
Wait Robo are you serious about this NOOOOO!!!!!

**lrrllrrl**<br>
S\*\*\* I got cramps on my sides for laughing too hard XDDDDD
