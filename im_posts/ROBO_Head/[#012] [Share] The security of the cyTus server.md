> The security system for the cyTus server is very tight. It is basically a giant military fortress in the sky. A.R.C. not only has the air force protecting it; even A.R.C. employees must go through multiple levels of security checks before entering the building. <br>

Record: Natural accidents since cyTus is launched: 0;<br>
human failure: 3. No record of casualty or property loss.

Not too bad a yield rate in my opinion

I can't say anything that is within the NDA.<br>
However, I can tell you that every single employee is required to go through a mental health assessment every three months. So everything should be fine.
