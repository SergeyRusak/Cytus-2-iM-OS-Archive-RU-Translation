[Announcement][PAFF][Missing]<br>
> ... PAFF (Real name: Aroma White), an artist who is currently under contract with us, left the hospital she was resting at on the night of September 9th without notice and has been missing since. As of today, her agent, the agency, and other colleagues have been unable to make any kind of contact with her. <br>
> <br>
> Here, I would like to first thank all the fans and our friends in the media for your understanding. Monophonic Entertainment chose to not explain the actual situation to the public when the incident first broke out due to an attempt to protect the privacy and rights of our artists. We have tried our best to search and investigate, in hopes that PAFF can contact us herself and explain the situation. However, we haven't made any notable progress. We are in the same position as everyone is right now: we know the fact PAFF has gone missing for no reason, but we don't know any details. More investigation is still required...<br>

Analysis: Suburb area lacking in surveillance equipment, basic stealth disguise enough to avoid detection

**Ayx_Socket**<br>
Is ROBO going to provide some direct hints

**Abin**<br>
There's just too many people in Node 08<br>
If she really wants to cover her tracks it's practically impossible to find her, right?

**Flower_Head**<br>
Anyone knows why PAFF left the hospital without permission?

**TobeTobe**<br>
I also find it weird that she leaves the hospital when she's supposed to be resting

**Ararar**<br>
Could it be that she was threatened or hypnotized???

**DustyAsh**<br>
Hacked???

**Ange3Lina**<br>
I know there's been two major hacking incidents recently, but don't blame everything on hackers lol

**ElinaDaniel**<br>
Feels like PAFF is purposely avoiding surveillance cameras and tracking<br>
If she just wandered off it shouldn't be hard to find her

**BuddyHat**<br>
Perhaps she has an accomplice???

**BabyHug**<br>
Whatever let's blame Ã†sir for everything~~~
