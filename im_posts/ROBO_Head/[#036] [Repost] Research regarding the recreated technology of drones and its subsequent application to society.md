# [Repost] Research regarding the recreated technology of drones and its subsequent application to society

[Excerpt][Document][Colin Neumann Jr.][Drones]<br>
>         The Drone is a type of mobile machinery that is equipped with a UI that's shared with the human brain. Originally, they were automatic tools used by the Architects for architecture, excavation, security and other purposes. After "The Decommission" and the disappearance of the Architects, humans founded A.R.C. to recreate and analyze the technology left behind. Due to how widely applicable and convenient the drones are, they are widely used in many fields, especially in areas where it's too risky for humans to venture ourselves.<br>
> <br>
>         To explain in a level understandable by the general public, not only can these drones be remotely controlled through a shared UI with the human brain, they can also operate on their own by algorithms inputted in advance. The algorithms can be written so that these drones will follow a certain set of principles when they operate. Unfortunately, humans have yet to fully grasp the algorithms used by the drones. This shortcoming led to many accidents (Including the model LE-110 Striker human assault incident that occurred in 680 N.A.). On top of that, even when remotely controlled via the shared UI by a human, incidents where the drone frankly ignored the pilot's directions and acted on its own were still fairly commonplace. In some large-scale simulations, the connection error rate even reached a staggering 3%. Of course, as you may have guessed, this number is nowhere to be seen on A.R.C.'s research conclusions.<br>
> <br>
>         From model LE-112 to LE-119, there are a total of eight drone models operating in the field right now. All of which are left behind by the Architects and each one has its own unique purpose. For example, large machinery and model LE-115 drones often handle demolition duties during an excavation. Under human modifications, each model also has different add-on equipment sets labeled A~C. However, in exchange for the add-ons, the connection yield rate has further diminished compare to the basic modules. As with the most primitive LE-110s and LE-111s, they have more units left behind than any other model. However, due to the constant string of accidents involving them, all units have been removed from field operations by the Administration Bureau. Currently, they are sealed indefinitely in a warehouse located in the forbidden area.<br>

>         It has been two hundred years since humans attempt to gain control over technologies we simply can't grasp. In the face of potential threats and unknown risks, we are unable to give up our innermost greed. We chose to seal them off, in hopes that one day we can truly uncover the secrets behind them. I can't say that this isn't a showcase of arrogant courage, but at the same time, the sheer lack of wisdom in this decision is also painfully noticeable. To those who made this decision, you have my sincere condolences.

As expected from Robohead, unearthes a master's paper in no time!

**ElinaDaniel**<br>
WTF these things are super dangerous no matter how you look at them... Yet the admins want to keep using them...

**Tracix**<br>
The water stream model is probably modified afterwards<br>
Don't think the Architects would need to worry about something as insignificant as mere riots<br>
Look forward to seeing Poo Spraying Drones JK lol

**Otis_Emik**<br>
That second sentence sounds like something Dr. ConneR would say

**ConneR**<br>
Such nostalgic words.<br>
    Thank you to **@ROBO\_Head** for finding the most appropriate explanatory document regarding the topic of drones. However, the document is undoubtedly dated now. Please allow me to make some additions regarding the views I developed in recent years. 

**ROBO_Head**<br>
Decision: This document among 13652 related documents, level of representativeness  highest<br>
Dr. **@ConneR** to make additions, very welcomed. Will allow this unit to further learn and update its knowledge.ï¼šD

**Amberclove**<br>
I'm tearing up a bit for seeing this conversation<br>
The two most knowledgable people of our generation are exchanging ideas without reservation

**RaiKiyumi**<br>
Two people? Or is it one man one machine? XD

**Ewx_Data**<br>
I'm excited about Colin sensei's take!

**CozyCaty**<br>
All set to write a research paper on drones~
