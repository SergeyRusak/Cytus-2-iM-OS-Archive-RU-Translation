> A protest broke out in Node 08's business district today. Angry fans surrounded Monophonic Entertainment's headquarters and a riot ensued. This protest is largely due to the fan dissatisfaction that has been building up since Monophonic's popular diva singer PAFF disappeared from the hospital she was resting in. Monophonic Entertainment's mishandling of the PAFF situation on top of the lackluster PR work they did afterward was what ultimately led to the chaos today. According to the drone analysis, there are thousands of protesters already on-site and the number is still increasing. The building where Monophonic Entertainment is located has been sealed off for safety reasons. The company has also request security and other assistance from the Administration Bureau.<br>

> According to our basic understanding of the situation, this protest is not headed by any specific organization or a thought leader. This protest was a result of an internet collaboration effort among fans using the hashtag **\#MonoWillPay**. Their main points of complaint are Monophonic Entertainment's insincere attitude towards handling the issues and their apparent hand-washing of their artists to keep themselves clean. As of this moment, the entire protest has been relatively calm. No incidents of violence have been reported so far. Nonetheless, the Administration Bureau still deployed two squadrons of riot control drones around Monophonic Entertainment headquarters for security concerns.<br>

> As of the publishing of this report, Monophonic Entertainment has yet to issue a statement regarding this protest. Rumor has it that several high-level directors will be addressing the crowd directly to settle the disputes. However, at the same time, there's also a different voice on the internet. Some have wondered if this entire event was just incited by people with malicious intent. They call for fans to stay calm and be alert; do not let others take advantage of your passion. <br>

S\*\*\* I need to leave for an appointment later and I have to pass by that area. Hope I won't be affected

**DuskDawn**<br>
Are they too bored or what?<br>
Why would you mob someone for something this stupid?

**Clairy**<br>
Is it just me, or does their appeals seem really vague?

**AbigaleJ**<br>
Probably for the compensation<br>
They want to see if they can pressure the company to pay up; that way they can earn some quick cash

**Wowow**<br>
I feel like launching a **\#FindPaff** is the more meaningful thing to do right now...

**Irisa0938**<br>
QAQ I want to take a few days off to help find PAFF too

**Copper_stone**<br>
Really hard for me to imagine that it would take this long to find someone in Node 08

**AaA**<br>
TBH, for a leaderless mob event like this, it's quite hard to tell if there's actually a mastermind behind the scenes

**BbB**<br>
This is the golden opportunity for rivals and enemies to take advantage of imo

**N0B0DY**<br>
Oh crap, my company is in the building right next to Mono HQ. We are definitely suffering collateral damage right now

**WoooooDy**<br>
Maybe ask your boss and see if you can leave early to avoid the mob???
