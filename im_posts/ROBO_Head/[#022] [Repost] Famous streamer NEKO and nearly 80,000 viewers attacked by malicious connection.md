> According to the information this reporter received before the deadline, famous streamer NEKO's recent stream, which attracted an audience of nearly 80,000, suffered a large-scale malicious connection attack moments after the stream started. The attack caused hundreds of thousands of people to experience temporary memory loss, an unprecedented disaster. <br>
> Some witnesses point out that before the victims become unconscious, they all received a mysterious call. Upon accepting the call, all victims suffer symptoms like epileptic seizure, severe headache, foaming at the mouth and fainting. <br>
> Node 08 United Hospital's director of Virtual Psychiatry stated:" We have requested specialized hospital beds from A.R.C. for those with severe symptoms. Other patients will have their symptoms eased by a medical wave deployed remotely. Due to a large number of patients, it may take a while for the wave to take effect. Please wait patiently."<br>
> Meanwhile, Node 08 Administration Bureau's security office has marked the streamer as a suspect and has brought her in for questioning. Details will require further investigation.<br>

Analysis: Comparing attack pattern and disconnection time...... 100%<br>
Speculation: All victims attacked by same source

Stupid Reporter, her full name is NEKO\#ΦωΦ

Man, I was planning to watch the stream yesterday but was hit with a train delay. Looking back now I was kinda lucky(?

**Dolly**<br>
**@ROBO\_Head** my older brother was also attacked will his life be in danger?

**ROBO_Head**<br>
Negative. Minimal damage to brain, temporary cognitive disorders or memory displacements will recover within 3~5 days

**Dolly**<br>
Thank you Robo\_head, my family can now rest assured after hearing that

**WuryAlot**<br>
Is it me, or is it really unsafe now...should I cut down on the connection time?
