> The stream hack incident that created quite the buzz a while ago just experienced a dramatic development today. Streamer NEKO\#ΦωΦ, who was marked by the Administration Bureau due to her suspected involvement, was acquitted of all charges and released this afternoon. After contacting the Law Enforcement Department (LED), this reporter was able to receive a quick confirmation of this news.<br>
> <br>
> This reporter also managed to get some exclusive information. According to an anonymous source inside LED, in the past few days, they've been receiving physical evidence that is very favorable for NEKO. The evidence is sufficient enough that the LED officers and the Bureau believe that NEKO is not the main culprit behind the large-scale hacking incident. To prevent public opinion from shifting, the procedures have been cleared and her release has been granted as quickly as possible. <br>

Investigation result compare with this unit's decision: Match<br>
NEKO\#ΦωΦ proxy server for culprit's memory alteration attacks

So it's all a misunderstanding<br>
NEKO fans win<br>
Haters, the door is to the left

**AntiNEKO**<br>

I'm sorry, won't do that again Q\_Q

**Copper_stone**<br>
Feels like the entire case is now back to point zero

**Arya_Poke**<br>
It was never gonna be NEKO in the first place lol<br>
This case went in the completely wrong direction from the start

**AntiMetal**<br>
If NEKO is a super hacker, then I'm ARC's CEO

**Gogossip**<br>
So she just went home quietly<br>
Judging by NEKO's personality, I thought she would've have started a party right there at the main entrance

**AbigaleJ**<br>
Are you sure that her real-life personality in private is the same as the one during stream ROFL

**Flower_Head**<br>
\*Whisper\* TBH I kinda secretly hope it's the same...

**C.Y.**<br>
I have a friend's friend who was her classmate. From what he said, not as over-the-top as she is in streams, but indeed a very fun and playful person

**Andy_Roid**<br>
Today the LED also only issued a brief statement. Seems like the investigation is truly going nowhere

**AaA**<br>
I've got to comment on NEKO's page to celebrate!!! ΦwΦ

**BbB**<br>
Good thing that the innocent wasn't wrongly accused in the end \*prays\*
