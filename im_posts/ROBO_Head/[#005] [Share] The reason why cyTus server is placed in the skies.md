> Do you know why the cyTus server is placed in the skies? It's because the energy required to power the server is immense. With specialized solar panels covering the entire server, solar power can be effectively used to charge the server. Its location in the Stratosphere also means that turbulence doesn't really harm the architecture. The cool temperature in the lower portion of the Stratosphere, around 216K (-57°C), also means that it's much easier to dissipate heat. <br>

P.S: cyTus server exact same coordinate as A.R.C. headquarters.

We see it every day in Node08, just look up and you can see it

**Cybel_Mach**<br>
My dad is super worried that thing will somehow fall from the sky lol

**Andy_Roid**<br>
Will it fall? **@ROBO\_Head**

**ROBO_Head**<br>
Analysis: Target   non human-failure   chance of falling from sky: 0.0003333333333333333……%

Wow ROBO\_head watches this show as well<br>
I also watch it every day right on time

**AvaJaKeLon**<br>
My uncles says it's very safe up there. There are plenty of protection mechanisms in it

**Esox_tron**<br>
**@ROBO\_Head** Even though it's technically a "kids" show, its contents are well researched. I often recommend this show to my graduate students. 

**ROBO_Head**<br>
Affirmative.

**DustyAsh**<br>
Never thought Robo\_head has a TV show recommendation

**koolboss01**<br>
But if that giant server really falls from the sky, it's gonna cause a boatload of damage I imagine...

**TunaLee**<br>
I can't figure it out. **@ROBO\_Head** HHHEEELLPPPP~

**ROBO_Head**<br>
Simulation: Target  (weight) \* (falling velocity)......<br>
Results: Node08 destroyed percentage: 100%

**NnNn**<br>
Nope nope nope nope 

**SuduMan**<br>
Nah, it's impossible for it to fall...

**SYY**<br>
A building that size...<br>
it's gonna be like a meteor hitting earth \*runs\*

**Andy_Roid**<br>
**@ROBO\_Head** It's just a simulation, I don't think an accident like that will ever happen

**ROBO_Head**<br>
Negative. Everything has chance.

**Ararar**<br>
NOOOOOOO

**OtaCU**<br>
A world with no internet might as well be dead
