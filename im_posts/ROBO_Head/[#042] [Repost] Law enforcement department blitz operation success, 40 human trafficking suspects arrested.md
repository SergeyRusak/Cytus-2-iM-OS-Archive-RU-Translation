> In an attempt to stop cross-Node human trafficking and online sex crimes which target young children, after six months of investigation, the special ops team of Node 08's law enforcement department launched a cleanup blitz yesterday. 16 suspects were arrested in Quadrant III and IV. Of the suspects, notorious pedophiles were among the criminals arrested. What's even more horrifying was that among the human trafficking group suspects, retired law enforcement agents and multiple minor gang members were also part of them.<br>

> Davis, the head of A.R.C's internet security department who assisted the Administration Bureau in this operation, also stated that the human trafficking groups use the black market and encrypted internet connections for things like information trades and contraband transactions. However, under the assistance of A.R.C., the Administration Bureau was able to get their hands on a large amount of evidence, which allowed them to strike preemptively and crack this case.<br>
> <br>
> While the Node 08 Administration Bureau is carrying out the aforementioned operation, four other cities, Node 03, 11, 18, 47 are also launching their own investigations. As the spearhead of this operation, Node 08's law enforcement department stated during the press conference that they apprehended around 40 suspects. All suspects are currently going through interrogation.<br>

Another screw up by a retired law enforcement agent?? Why don't they just outsource the whole thing to ARC?

With somebody like Xenon at the helm are you really sure that's a wise decision????
