> Yesterday, in the middle of the night, a law enforcement drone performing its routine patrol at Node 08 Quadrant I's automatic area accidentally attacked a civilian household in the area. A model LE-117 Striker drone that belongs to the Node 08 Administration Bureau suddenly lost control and launched shock blast grenades at a civilian building.  The law enforcement agent who was controlling the drone remotely via a virtual connection also suffered minor damage to his brain when the error occurred. The good news is that the Administration Bureau instantly reacted and shut down the drone's battery, therefore no further damage was caused.<br>
> <br>
> This accident is the fifth incident since Node 08 was established where law enforcement drones accidentally harm/kill innocent civilians. Of the 5 incidents, the most noteworthy is the first, which occurred on December 9th, 680 N.A.-: Cross Node transport system administrator Carly Pauline was accidentally involved in a gunfight between law enforcement agents and armed robbers on her way home from work. Back then, the technology for controlling drones was not mastered by humans yet, and the unfamiliarity with the technology led to tragedy. A model LE-110 Striker accidentally unloaded its riot control machine guns against Carly Pauline, severely injuring her. She died from heavy blood loss before she made it to the hospital. This incident prompted the Administration Bureau to establish a rule stating that human remote controls are mandatory for any drone operations. However, it has been years since the rule was established, yet drone-related accidents still happen...<br>

Decision: Shared UI between drones and human brain still not fully-recreated technology ：/

I remember that 680 N.A. incident. It was a really big deal when I was a child<br>
My parents forbade me to go out too late because of that incident

The place I work is right next to a relay patrol station for the agents. There's a boatload of drones coming in and out of the station every day >"

**BUCK$**<br>
I was terrified of drones when I was a kid because that incident scarred me

**MAN_Dora**<br>
I recall that poor family who lost a loved one. The news interviewed their young daughter; it was so tear-jerking

**m00nl16h7**<br>
They were a family of law-abiding public servants, then all of a sudden this tragedy completely tore the family apart

**DustyAsh**<br>
WTF why would someone put a phishing program under the news 凸(-\_-\#)

**MirriLL**<br>
Dude, drones are deadly AF ok

**AvaJaKeLon**<br>
My uncle told me that law enforcement drones used to be even more destructive, but a lot of their functions and weapons were locked for safety concerns since they will be operating in highly populated cities

**Mulder**<br>
So you're telling me that they weren't originally built for public security?

**SYY**<br>
Why did the admins allow these killing machines to run around freely???
