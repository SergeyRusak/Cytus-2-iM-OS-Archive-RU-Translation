> According to official data from A.R.C., the cyTus virtual city has over 200 million registered users and over 180 million active users daily, a 23% increase compared to last year. Mega SNS blocks have also reached the number of 37000. To handle this increasing need for connection, A.R.C. and the Nodes are scheduling for a massive hardware update. <br>
