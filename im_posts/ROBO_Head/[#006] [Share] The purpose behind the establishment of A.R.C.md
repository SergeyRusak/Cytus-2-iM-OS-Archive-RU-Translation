> The A.R.C. was established two centuries ago. It is dedicated to the excavation, recovery, development and recreation of past technologies and provides said technology for all humans to use equally. <br>
> Of all the technology, the one that affects humans the most is certainly the creation and application of imitation Bio-neural networks. It led to a massive increase in the amount of data transferred and a much-improved internet using experience. <br>
