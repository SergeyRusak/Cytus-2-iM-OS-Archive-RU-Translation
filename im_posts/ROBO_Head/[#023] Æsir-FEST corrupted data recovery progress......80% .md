The truth is some attention seeking prick got stage fright and ran away

If every single connection is cut, isn't it similar to repeater malfunction or a blackout?

**C.Y.**<br>
Doesn't this looks somewhat similar to NEKO's case?<br>
though the magnitude differs a lot 

**Andy_Roid**<br>
never thought data can be this corrupted

I was a participant, all this talk is starting to mess up my memory

**BbB**<br>
What did you remember?

**AaA**<br>
I remember everything up to Robo\_head's performance, nothing after

**BbB**<br>
My friends who participated said the same thing

**AbigaleJ**<br>
But I can't even remember ROBO\_Head's performance

**Flower_Head**<br>
Almost complete, we want to know what happened
