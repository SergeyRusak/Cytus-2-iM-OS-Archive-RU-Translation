[Exclusive][Xenon][NEKO][Cherry]<br>
> Famous streamer NEKO\#ΦωΦ, who was brought in for investigation by the LED due to her involvement with a hacking incident that affected thousands, was acquitted of all charges yesterday morning and has been escorted home by friends.<br>
> <br>
> However, according to this reporter's actual on-site observation, the friends that came to pick her up turned out to be the also internet-famous one-man band leader Xenon and the recent darling of Monophonic Entertainment, Cherry PuNK's lead vocalist Cherry. Xenon and NEKO have had very intimate interactions on iM. In fact, many fans have already suspected that the two were dating. However, this time, Xenon brought along his ex-girlfriend from the Crystal PuNK days as well. The three appears to get along with each other very well too. This reporter was extremely confused and had no idea what they were up to. Upon exiting the LED, NEKO's expression seemed very relaxed. After a quick chatter with Xenon and Cherry, she left in a car. <br>
> <br>
> Is Xenon really so charming to the point that he can get away with two-timing? Or did Xenon, real name Simon Jackson, utilized his powers at A.R.C. to rescue his precious girlfriend? For more behind-the-scenes information on this case, please follow 08 Daily.<br>

Decision: Attempt to spread malicious message

**Axroid_Sona**<br>
I feel like Xenon himself is very questionable<br>
Like he's the only one to get off scot-free from start to finish, coincidence?

**ShadowForest**<br>
God what a life! Paid good money, has fans, and now cute girlfriend(s)

**DuskDawn**<br>
Are u guys blind? Robohead has detected that it's malicious message

**Doubty**<br>
ROBO\_head's decision is based on information on the internet, right? This means that if the information is hidden in the real world there's no way for him to reference it correctly~~

**Brock3tt**<br>
This does remind us: we've never actually discussed in detail how Robohead's thinking process works...

**Irisa0938**<br>
Let go of the two cute girls~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Copper_stone**<br>
Why would Cherry go pick up NEKO with Xenon though, that's what really bugs me<br>
Am I the only one who thinks this group doesn't make any sense?

**Arya_Poke**<br>
What "sense" do you want, it's friends picking up a friend lol<br>
Stop getting mislead by this BS report OK ???

**AntiMetal**<br>
Cherry was quite the bad girl back then XD Done some shady things by herself apparently?? At least that's what my friend told me

**Gogossip**<br>
X always acts as if he's better than everyone else and he doesn't care about anything<br>
These type of people are the worst and they're fake-AF LOLOL

**NoProblemo**<br>
Readers LOVE malicious messages (Not a typo)

**Andy_Roid**<br>
Isn't ROBO somewhat contributing to the spread of this report by writing this post? \*Faceplams\*

**CyberLord**<br>
Lies based on facts are the scariest<br>
( ﾉД`)( ﾉД`)( ﾉД`)

**Dreamer**<br>
Xenon and Cherry was a really infamous couple in the world of underground bands in the past~~<br>
It's a dream so don't PM me
