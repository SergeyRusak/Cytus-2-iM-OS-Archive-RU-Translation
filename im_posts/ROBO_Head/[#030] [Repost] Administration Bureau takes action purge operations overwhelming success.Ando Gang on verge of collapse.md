> Since the middle of last year, the law enforcement department (LED) of the Administration Bureau has launched a series of operations titled "Node 08 gang purge". These operations focus on rounding up illegal gang members and eliminating locations where gang activities are rampant. As of this month, 78 listed locations across all 4 quadrants of Node 08 have been targeted for compulsory criminal search. 55 members from major gangs such as the Ando Gang and the Baro Brotherhood have been found liable for the violation of the Organized Crime Act, Electronic Narcotics Prohibition Act, Criminal Intimidation and Extortion Prevention Act, and more. Also found in the criminal searches are 129 suspects who are involved in other criminal cases, hundreds of doses of electronic narcotics, 11 standard-issue law enforcement rifles, and 50 pulse rifle magazines. <br>

> During these operations, over 90 percent of the Ando Gang's leadership core has been arrested. Their funds have been blocked as well. The entire organization has been fatally crippled due to the lack of any leadership. Originated from Node03, this notoriously violent gang that once ruled over the Node 08 underworld as its largest gang is now nothing more than a mere name. <br>

> According to the head of Quadrant II's LED, working in tandem with the Administration Bureau's "Node 08 gang purge" operations is just a small part of a bigger picture. The regulations for Cross-Node traveling is set to loosen in the near future, so more people are expected to visit the Nodes. In addition to rounding up the gangs in each region, other illegal activities, such as smuggling, that harm the civilians' safety will also be investigated and punished according to the law when found. The goal is to improve security and create a positive image for the city. <br>

Analysis: Node 08 gang influence decreased 35%

Wow so Robohead can even get his hands on gang information, like how XD

**TunaLee**<br>
Feels like it could be done by reverse tracking the gang's profitable businesses?

**TrojanPony**<br>
Seems to me that we won't be missing them any time soon?

**ElinaDaniel**<br>
NICE! Last time my friend caused a ruckus in their nightclub and got pummelled so badly that he nearly ended up in the ICU. They had it coming for a long time!

**Alaina**<br>
... I say your friend had it coming as well (?

Electronic narcotics do nothing but destroy lives<br>
People who produce and sell them should all be imprisoned for life

**MAN_Dora**<br>
The admins have been letting these people run free for too long

Good Riddance

**DustyAsh**<br>
If the balance is now broken, will other gangs use this opportunity to expand themselves?

**MirriLL**<br>
Some stores in Quadrant II could barely sustain themselves due to all the protection fees demanded

**AvaJaKeLon**<br>
The admins have been s\*\*\* on a lot these years; turns out they can still do some good

**Mulder**<br>
From what I've heard, Node 03 is the "true" gang-operated city

**Fu7ureW0rld**<br>
B, but, Node 03 is quite fun. Its culture and people are very different from 08

See ya you bastards
