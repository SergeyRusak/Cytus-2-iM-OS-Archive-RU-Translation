# [Repost] An urban legend nightmare comes true: memory lost for millions, main culprit still nowhere to be seen

ROBO_Head:<br>
[Æsir][Breaking][News][ARC][Administration Bureau]<br>
> The mysterious musician Æsir, who made a high-profile concert announcement half-a-year ago, was exposed by famous internet DJ ROBO\_Head for the suspicious use of illegal methods to erase the memories of all connected users. However, the actual method and purpose of these actions are still unclear. Earlier today, we received some inside news from the law enforcement department of the Administration Bureau. The Bureau has initiated the investigation, and there is a possibility that this incident is related to the "streamer hacked" incident that occurred at the end of last month.<br>
> <br>
> Regarding this issue, the spokesperson for the Bureau stated that if the actual situation indeed matched the rumors and that the users' memories were erased, this will be the largest internet terrorist attack since Node 08 was established. "We are facing a unique situation never seen before. This is a brand-new type of enemy, using a brand-new method of attack." Davis, A.R.C.'s minister of internet security, also released an announcement earlier today, stating that they will be working together with the Bureau to locate the culprit and uncover the truth...<br>

Speculation: Investigation progress...... 15%<br>
Action: Continue search of internet and collect list of possible culprits

**T3RA_wr47h**<br>
It's times like this that I appreciate the fact that Robohead doesn't have a brain<br>
If not for that fact, we might have no evidence at all on the event

**Ayx_Socket**<br>
It feels like you are saying that he's an idiot by stating that he doesn't have a brain XDDDD

**Talus_Alpha**<br>
**@ROBO\_Head** You have no brains~~~~

**ROBO_Head**<br>
This unit consists of inorganic compounds<br>
Brain organic biological organ<br>
Conclusion: This unit no brains<br>
P.S: Smarter than 99.99% of carbon-based creatures ：D

**HC**<br>
ROBO\_Head should count as a Silicon-based creature I think XDD Just like how Sci-Fi novels describe alien creatures

**AliceinCytus**<br>
No matter what, I still can't remember anything about the concert<br>
Or should I say can I still remember anything?<br>
If I really do remember, is it really my memory of that day?

**NerfThat**<br>
I saw Dr. Hawkins on a show the other day. He said that although the memory is theoretically erased, the human brain has some kind of self-defense mechanism. So there might be a backup hidden in the subconscious

**BUCK$**<br>
Ah man, times like this make you wish that you're a computer and you can just go into the subconscious to copy and paste your memory to your heart's content

**MAN_Dora**<br>
This is supposed to be an issue for the admins<br>
But the A.R.C. seems more reliable now 

**Heart_Head**<br>
It's always been like that in Node 08 XDD

**Cybel_Mach**<br>
I<br>
Still<br>
Don't<br>
Remember<br>
Anything

**AntiReality**<br>
I feel like rather than worry about some kind of terrorist attack, we should apprehend and restrict every person that could be a culprit

**AntiReality**<br>
You know, people like NEKO, ConneR...etc. are all pretty dangerous people<br>
Not having quarantines or restrictions on their internet usage is dumb<br>
Why are these potential risks allowed to roam freely among us regular folks???

**Heart_Head**<br>
I utterly disagree with every single word you just said

**SYY**<br>
Idiot. So you decide that other people's rights can be violated just because of some insubstantial sense of danger?

**AntiReality**<br>
You must be one of those idiot fans of theirs right? I can't and won't communicate with someone who can't think with their own brains sorry

**DustyAsh**<br>
Moron by doing that you're falling into the real culprit's trap

**Smurky**<br>
Can NEKO be released already? Like how it's impossible for her to be the perp!!!

**D33M0**<br>
I also feel that a mere streamer has no ability nor the necessity to perform an attack like this

**Marsh**<br>
Maybe because she wants to be famous?

**CyberLord**<br>
Dude she is already super famous. Didn't you see how many people were connected to her stream when she was attacked!!
