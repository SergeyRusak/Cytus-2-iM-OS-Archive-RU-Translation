[Announcement][Monophonic Entertainment][PAFF][Contract Termination]<br>
> ... After Miss White went missing without notice, we have also tried our utmost to search for her and handle the losses. However, her action is indeed a violation of her contract and has already caused the company a substantial amount of damage, including property damage, other contract artists getting injured and more. In addition, it has led to the mistrust between fellow fans and the company, something neither of us wants to see happen. <br>
> <br>
> Therefore, we hereby announce the following information to fellow fans and friends in the media: After taking all issues into consideration, we have reached an agreement with Miss White's agent, Miss Helena White. We will be terminating the contract between Monophonic Entertainment Inc. and Miss Aroma White, effective immediately. We will no longer be responsible for her future career as an artist...<br>

Mono really just got the short straw at the worst possible time, but, can't say I didn't see that coming<br>
The way they handle the situation is so terrible that it's practically ASKING for public outrage

**WhiteEYE33**<br>
It really is terrible... makes me wonder if they actually hired monkeys to do PR work

**Damn3D**<br>
Dude, if you ask me, the ones who drew the shortest straws are their other artists~~ Especially Cherry...

**C.Y.**<br>
Agreed. I wonder if Cherry is feeling better now

**Alaina**<br>
There were some news about gangs, could it be that she got arrested?

**m00nl16h7**<br>
I thought most of the gangs are busted already?

**MAN_Dora**<br>
God, all these recent incidents are so confusing. I don't what's real and what's fake anymore
