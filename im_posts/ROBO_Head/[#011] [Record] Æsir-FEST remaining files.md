Really?

**YsoSurprise**<br>
EHHHHHH, so it does exists?

**Talus_Alpha**<br>
If there's an opening act, there should be more performances right? (I didn't particpate BTW)

**KarenMayako**<br>
I heard PAFF's!

**Cybel_Mach**<br>
I was there, it ended after Robo\_head's performance

**DustyAsh**<br>
I don't even remember if PAFF and ROBO\_head really performed TBH

**Andy_Roid**<br>
Let's get PAFF herself to answer **@PAFF-Official**

**ROBO_Head**<br>
Speculation: Chance of reply from PAFF-Official: 0.7%

**Ayx_Socket**<br>
TOO LOW!

**Esox_tron**<br>
Wait how the hell is that number calculated XDDD

**CHanatsuka**<br>
Hm? I just realized that Robo\_head replied without a tag

**Heart_Head**<br>
I think Robo\_head scans the tag before deciding whether or not to reply
