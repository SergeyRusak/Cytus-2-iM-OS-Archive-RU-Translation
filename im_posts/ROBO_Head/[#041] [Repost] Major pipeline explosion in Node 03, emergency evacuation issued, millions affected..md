> Last night, a series of chained explosions occurred in Node 03, Quadrant IV. It is suspected that a leak in the local pipeline system has resulted in at least 30 major explosions. The flames quickly engulfed the dozens of buildings nearby. Estimated casualties currently sit at 20 dead and 300+ injured. In order to prevent further accidents, Node 03's Administration Bureau has cut off the energy pipelines and electric power supply within a radius of several kilometers around the area.<br>
> <br>
> The epicenter of this disaster is Node 03, Quadrant IV's Genmu Boulevard. The explosions first began with several key buildings and following the explosions, a massive firestorm erupted.  From the images taken by the airborne surveillance cameras, we can see that the buildings were immediately swallowed by the inferno and created a mountain of thick smoke. Large squads of firefighting drones reached the accident site 90 seconds after the initial explosion. They started launching fire extinguishing bombs and firing high\-pressure water streams to keep the fire under control.<br>
> <br>
> The rescue workers themselves have reported multiple casualties due to the explosion and the subsequent fire. This includes 6 firefighters, 2 law enforcement agents and 5 possible researchers who were found wearing lab coats.<br>
> <br>
> According to the neighborhood, it appears that the power supply experienced some unstableness earlier today. The Administration Bureau's initial speculation is that a crack in the energy transport pipelines caused the accident. The Bureau has issued an emergency evacuation order to civilians who live within Quadrant IV's 203 \~ 903 areas. The head of the security council, Ryu Minatsuki, has also announced that the distribution centers will be opened to the civilians as temporary shelters. Rumors of an inner conflict between the Node 03 Administration Bureau and the gang organizations have been running rampant in recent years. It is yet to be determined if this series of explosions has something to do with gang violence and revenge seeking. The law enforcement department has already launched the investigation. <br>

Holy s\*\*\* Node03 is scary who the heck would want to live there

**Nexus697**<br>
03 is easily top 5 in terms of population though XDDDDD

03 is pretty much overseen by gangs, nobody's got the balls to say anything

**MirriLL**<br>
Not surprised, it's 03. Isn't it basically a tradition there to give babies a bulletproof vest on baby shower

**Abin**<br>
The admins over here are super useless<br>
The "private organizations" manage pretty much everything

**AbigaleJ**<br>
WTH is a security council?? We don't have that here in 08 do we??

Ya all a bunch of noobs<br>

Gold bless those who are injured<br>
No matter what<br>
these accidents are always the most brutal to the innocent civilians

R.I.P

Even if it's indeed an energy pipeline explosion, why are there no safety/prevention mechanisms at all? And the entire automatic fire suppression system broke down at the same time? I feel like there are some serious conspiracies behind this

**Popo**<br>
Gangs removing their enemies??

My colleague moved here from Node 03<br>
According to him, over half of his classmates were already directly or indirectly recruited by the gangs when they are still studying at the Academy

08 has very good security, we shouldn't be affected, right?

**Andy_Roid**<br>
With big brother ARC overseeing everything in the skies, I imagine even if there is an accident, it wouldn't be as destructive (I think?

Dude, don't jinx us LOLOLOL
