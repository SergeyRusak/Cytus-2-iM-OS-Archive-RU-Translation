OHHHH! You guys are gonna be famous!!

**aasdd**<br>
So Cherry's becoming a superstar now\~ Don't forget me... Q\_Q

**CherryPuNK**<br>
**@aasdd** Ha! Don't be ridiculous

**NEKOSAIKOU**<br>
It's the band that **@NEKO\#ΦωΦ** recommended a lot!! Must support!!<br>
But look out though, since Mono is shady\-AF LOLOL

**D33M0**<br>
Mono's commission fee is brutal, why would you join it...

**w_Rosabel_w**<br>
Followed \\m/

**Pumpkinforest**<br>
It's not a bad thing to get more exposure though. Mono's marketing team has a pretty good track record

**Bit_Inex**<br>
Agreed. This band is awesome; it just never got the recognition it deserves lulz

**TreeNoAlice**<br>
If not for the collaboration with PAFF a while ago, I wouldn't have known this band. Music is very solid

**Lynx87**<br>
Mono give PAFF back, you a\*\*holes! ˋˊ

**CrystalP**<br>
\\Any Crystal fans here/

**Crys_Forever**<br>
Still prefer the old style though...

**KiwaHu**<br>
Will the data from the old account stay there? I really like to visit that account to see recreations of your performances!

**CherryPuNK**<br>
**@KiwaHu** Yes. It's just that there won't be new posts\~ the data there will gradually be transferred to this account too

Xenon is more Metalcore, ok? They are two completely different styles

**LyLah1207**<br>
Can't stand the screaming

\[Announcement\]<br>
This week, the "Floor 108 Opening Celebration Event" held at Quadrant III's Tower 054 has invited Cherry PuNK for a special performance. Come and celebrate this occasion with us! (The event is completely free!)

Time: 702/09/15 PM 03:00 \~ PM 04:30

Originally plan to participate in this event, **@PAFF\-Official** couldn't make it because of her physical conditions. The members also feel terribly sorry for fellow PUFFERs.

However, PAFF recorded a holo\-recreation and she has a message for everyone. We would like fellow fans to come and support PAFF with us!

That day, one of our new songs in the new album we are working on will also be performed for the first time. Please look forward to it!

Shut up you cream Puffs. ChP rose to fame by their own strength and music ok? They will be fine even without Mono

**Fuxkoff**<br>
Oh yeah? Then why won't they f\*\*\*off and go back to being an underground band? Stop riding on PAFF's coattails

**CherryPuNK**<br>
Hi, I'm Cherry. Thank you to everyone for their passion during yesterday's performance<br>
LUMY has been saying that it's my turn to write a thank\-you post, but I was so tired yesterday that I was out cold the instant I got home... I am so sorry!

For yesterday's Encore song, I sang Crystal PuNK's old song "Still"<br>
Since this is a rare opportunity, I would like to talk a little bit about this song<br>
This is a song written during the CP (Crystal PuNK) days by Simon (a.k.a. Xenon)<br>
It's also a song that I really, really love. The concept behind this song is as follows:

 "In everyone's lives, there's always fear that we dread to confront.<br>
 No matter how many friends we have, every person is still an independent individual.<br>
 No matter how close we are to another person, we can't expect them to fully understand our pressure and anxiety.<br>
 In most cases, we are the only ones who can truly feel the pain, and we have to confront it alone.

 But this is exactly why we should try to understand that every life is a different story<br>
 Even though they may not feel your pain,<br>
 they just might be carrying an equally, perhaps even heavier burden that you don't understand. <br>
 The most important thing of all is to conjure up the courage to overcome your own fears, <br>
 and cherish those who are willing to stay by your side even if they don't fully understand you.

 Here's to hope that this song can bring courage to those who are fighting their own unique battles"

**Axroid_Sona**<br>
Were Xenon and Cherry dating each other during the CP days

**TreeNoAlice**<br>
You mean a CP in CP? (??

**Cipher_troll**<br>
I smell some sweet, sweet gossip

**Gogossip**<br>
I believe that them breaking up was the reason the band disbanded

NO, Xenon belongs to NEKO!!!

BS! NEKO belongs to me!!!!!

**CherryMyLife**<br>
Dude WTH, I see you literally everywhere ROFL

**SuperKY**<br>
So is X dating two people at the same time? I don't get it

**Justin888**<br>
Wait what led to this conclusion? That's some funky logic you got there LMFAO

**Fuxkoff**<br>
That's one heck of a complicated relationship circle

**@Xenon** Explain yourself

**Fu7ureW0rld**<br>
Here comes the tagging

**D33M0**<br>
Haven't seen Xenon a lot these days

**Gearz_Igo**<br>
Probably dealing with the AEsir case

Has anyone been to Quadrant I?<br>
That's an area where very few people live or even talk about now<br>
A while ago, I paid the area a visit to draw some inspiration<br>
After seeing the scenery there, it just feels like it doesn't belong to this city<br>
Everything is so quiet and motionless, despite the fact that the bustling city is only a few blocks away

When I was a child, my father always told me that there are things we frankly couldn't understand<br>
A long time ago, the Architects left behind all this and disappeared without a trace

There will always be that day, where we come across the departure of our loved ones<br>
It's inevitable, like the rotation of this planet

Maybe we'll be living every day carefully and worried because of that<br>
Maybe we've gone through this situation time and time again in our hearts<br>
Maybe, we are just not prepared to confront those that are about to leave

I live right across the bridge, the only thing I don't like is the ARC's carriers passing by every morning. God they are loud...

**DustyAsh**<br>
It's pretty dangerous there isn't it? The admins sealed off a lot of places it seems

**MirriLL**<br>
Yeah, it's said that there are a lot of broken and unusable facilities in there

**iWanttobelieve**<br>
Maybe the Architects are some outside space aliens?

Outside space aliens.... sounds like something the NEETs would hate LMFAO

Jusy got dumped by my girlfreind ... this post jit me right in the frels......

A while ago my MeowBot also jumped off a building, I was so sad...

**D33M0**<br>
Wait what?? What the heck happened lol?

**DoctorWhere**<br>
That area is super mysterious. So many urban legends were created there @ @

**vikisser**<br>
Wait are we talking about urban legends!? Then it's time to **@ROBO\_Head** XD

**ROBO_Head**<br>
Analysis: Node 08 civilian active areas average less than 5% of the entire Node<br>
Conclusion: Rumors about Quadrant I believability: Extremely low.

**KiwaHu**<br>
What does that even mean Robo? It just looks like gibberish to me XDDD

**KoraKora**<br>
The only thing it proves is that there really is nobody living there LOL

**ZigZag**<br>
Hold on a minute, is 5% the right number? Is Node08 really THAT massive??? lololol

**AvaJaKeLon**<br>
It is actually. There are many places where most people won't even go near<br>
Also if you live in the Tower, one Tower is a pretty sufficient area for daily activities<br>
Some people probably never left the Tower before they became an adult

**iSEEu**<br>
Are you sure it's for inspiration? A few days ago someone caught a shot of Cherry catching a motorcycle ride with Xenon again ROFL

**w_Rosabel_w**<br>
Stop spreading unconfirmed fake rumors ok = =

**iSEEu**<br>
If you don't believe me, just do a quick search in the gossip blocks. The photo is right there

**SuperKY**<br>
S\*\*\* so does that mean the Xenon two\-timing stuff is real?

**Gearz_Igo**<br>
Dude, there was never proof that Xenon and NEKO were actually dating, so stop making stupid assumptions...

**Shipper**<br>
And it's not like a single photo's gonna prove anything. I myself hope this is the sign of a possible CP comeback XD

**Fuxkoff**<br>
**@Xenon** Didn't your post say that you'll be offering everything to help deal with internet security? Turns out you're too busy dealing with girls lolololol

**NekoSamurai**<br>
So... has NEKO been released yet...??

**KirinKiraKira**<br>

Goodnight everybody

Cherry here<br>
Just now, after hearing from friends and seeing the sudden burst of messages in my inbox, <br>
I finally discovered that I was targeted by a gossip magazine

Right now, Xenon and I are simply old friends<br>
Fans who have followed us since the Crystal PuNK days should understand this very clearly<br>
Even though the band disbanded, all the members are still in contact with each other

We originally had plans to meet each other that day<br>
Going to the LED office to pick up his friend was a complete afterthought<br>
That day was also my first time meeting the streamer NEKO

Regarding other false accusations in the magazine<br>
The Xenon I know is definitely not someone who would indulge in illegal activities<br>
Hope everyone can respect other people's privacy and avoid baseless speculations<br>
Even though we are public figures, we would still like some breathing room

Thank you

Hello everyone<br>
We have an emergency announcement to make<br>
Earlier today, our lead voaclist Cherry was entering the Monophonic Entertainment headquarters building when she was accidently caught in the violent actions of the protesters.<br>
She suffered multiple scrapping wounds on her elbows and calves. She also experienced symptoms of dizziness, possibly due to the excessive force she was pushed with<br>
 <br>
Fortunately, under the escort of the security team,<br>
she was sent to the hospital on time and got proper treatment<br>
As of now, she is through with her treatment and is now resting<br>
 <br>
A big thank you to fellow fans and others for your support<br>
After Cherry gets better after a few days' rest<br>
we will let her address everyone herself<br>

Hello everyone

Cherry here<br>
Allow me to show my gratitude to everyone who was concerned about me<br>
I've been discharged from the hospital yesterday<br>
Thanks to the proper treatment of the doctors, I'm feeling very well now

Held a little celebration party with my band members<br>
They've been teasing me about being the first artist to ever end up in a hospital by simply going to work<br>
Can't blame them though; you don't find a lead vocalist who's this unlucky everyday

However, I don't blame anybody. I really do understand why the fans are so emotionally fired\-up for this incident<br>
The incidents and people I've come across lately <br>
have led me to the realization, that if it was me who lost something I treasured<br>
I certainly won't be able to keep myself under control

Through this incident<br>
I had the opportunity to take a short break and think about some things

The distance between people have been getting larger by the minute<br>
However, we still breathe and live under the same starry sky<br>
It was in the past, it is now, and it will certainly continue into the future too

Hope that I can put such emotions into my songs<br>
and continue to sing them for you guys<br>
Thank you

Hahaha All the artists are so supportive of Cherry<br>
Whether it's current or previous band members, friends will always be friends<br>
This type of comradery between artists is amazing

Beware of Mono's ultimate move... Contract termination from the most minute of issues<br>

Can't help but think back to Æsir\-FEST. That's also an event hosted by a DJ... Robo probably won't brainwash us right? At least that's what I hoped (((；ﾟДﾟ))))

**SuduMan**<br>
This group can totally brainwash everyone with just their music!! I'm so excited about this!!!
