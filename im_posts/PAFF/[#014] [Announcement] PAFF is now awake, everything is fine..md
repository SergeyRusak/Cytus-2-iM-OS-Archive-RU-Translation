# [Announcement] PAFF is now awake, everything is fine.
## Post
**PAFF-Official**<br>
Greeting fellow fans. I am Helena, PAFF's agent. 

PAFF is now awake. Her condition is stable, but to be absolutely certain that she is fine, we will be staying at the hospital for a few more days to do a complete check-up.

I have to be honest, I really panicked when PAFF collapsed during last night's event. Not as an agent, but as PAFF's sister and only family. 

Due to my inability to handle the chaotic venue and comfort the fans, the situation got really messy. I apologize for my mistakes. I am really sorry. 

Many of you may know that PAFF suffered a serious accident before she debuted. The accident caused severe damage to her brain, so please don't blame her for the incident today. 

PAFF is a very shy child. I know that because I grew up with her. Her devotion to fans and her efforts to try communicating with this world through music, I've witnessed it all with my own eyes. 

I would like fans to not abandon her due to her physical shortcomings. Besides music, your support is the only thing that keeps her going.

For remaining with her and supporting her through all these times, I am deeply grateful. All of you, thank you so much!
