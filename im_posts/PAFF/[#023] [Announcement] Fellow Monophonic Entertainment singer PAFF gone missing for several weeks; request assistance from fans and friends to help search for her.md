# [Announcement] Fellow Monophonic Entertainment singer PAFF gone missing for several weeks; 
request assistance from fans and friends to help search for her
## Post
PAFF-Official:<br>
To our dear fans and precious customers,

PAFF (Real name: Aroma White), an artist who is currently under contract with us, left the hospital she was resting at on the night of September 9th without notice and has been missing since. As of today, her agent, the agency, and other colleagues have been unable to make any kind of contact with her. 

Here, I would like to first thank all the fans and our friends in the media for your understanding. Monophonic Entertainment chose to not explain the actual situation to the public when the incident first broke out due to an attempt to protect the privacy and rights of our artists. We have tried our best to search and investigate, in hopes that PAFF can contact us herself and explain the situation. However, we haven't made any notable progress. We are in the same position as everyone is right now: we know the fact PAFF has gone missing for no reason, but we don't know any details. More investigation is still required. 

We are essentially PAFF's closest family when it comes to her business. As our business blooms, we grow together. We had hope that PAFF could contact us herself during this time period; unfortunately, things didn't work out as we expected. Please allow us to sincerely apologize to all our fans and the public for our actions in the past few weeks. We are very, very sorry. 

We also hope that everyone can help us locate the whereabouts of PAFF. If you have any hints, please contact us. 


Sincerely<br>
Chris Carpenter<br>
Monophonic Entertainment CEO

WTF, you decide to tell us the truth NOW???<br>
So you really thought we were so stupid that we would believe your previous BS, didn't you!!!

**Poopytrap**<br>
So they're washing their hand of her now; not sure if they did a good job though

**TunaLee**<br>
Not a very clean wash imo

**beeeeeeeeee**<br>
Seriously how long has it been and NOW you're asking for help<br>
What if something really bad actually happened to her? Who's responsibility is that!!!??????????????

**SancTityKnight**<br>
PAFF please be OK!!!

**Poopytrap**<br>
Leaving without notice all of a sudden is so worrying...

**StuffyMouth**<br>
I truly feel that asking for a refund was one of the best decisions I ever made in my life

**An0nym0us**<br>
We've been saying, "Not surprised, it's Mono" for years<br>
Well, look what we have now<br>
"Surprise, Muthaf\*\*\*er!"

**koolboss01**<br>
I don't give a flying f\*\*\* about your apology statement. Fix your damn refund system first!!

**CeLiA**<br>
I don't think an apology statement can save this mess now

**HC**<br>
If she's been missing for so long, could it be a kidnapping??

**lenba**<br>
So worried about PAFF >"< what should I do

**TobeTobe**<br>
If it's really a kidnapping they would've informed the police a long time ago ok. Only thing Mono didn't want was to blow this out of proportion; no way they ignore PAFF's safety

**Chevalier151**<br>
Hey, I've been wanting to boycott Mono since the beginning. Anybody care to join me now?

**IronFan**<br>
We should go protest at Mono headquarters<br>
Did they really think that all fans are nerds who don't go outside

**Mohito**<br>
You just exposed yourself lul

**NotScalper**<br>
What's wrong with being a nerd? We go outside too

**SuduMan**<br>
So Mono's been looking for her all this time to no avail and is finally asking for help now<br>
Looks like they thought too highly of themselves before?

**PaffCheckin**<br>
Yep hand washing indeed. Keeping themselves squeaky clean

**StuffyMouth**<br>
So worried about her safety<br>
If everyone works together we should find her in no time

**Varinaya**<br>
Pray that PAFF is alright!!

**PaffCheckin**<br>
**\#PrayForPAFF** Can we still use this

**Hatehate**<br>
Let me interpret this for everyone:<br>
Hello<br>
PAFF got lost, even though she's an adult<br>
We can't do anything about it as well<br>
You can't blame the agency<br>
Because we are only responsible for making money with PAFF<br>
We are not responsible for being her GPS

**MustangMartin**<br>
Dude WTF pretty accurate though<br>
LMFAO

**Hulujam**<br>
That's a super mean interpretation

**AngryFan**<br>
Getting even more angry after reading it

**Strawcherry**<br>

**MAN_Dora**<br>
Stop exaggerating the truth idiots. It's not funny at all!
