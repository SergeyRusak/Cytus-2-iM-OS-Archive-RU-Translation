**PAFF-Official**<br>
Fellow fans, sorry for the interruption. I am Helena, PAFF's agent.<br>
A few moments ago, when performing the Encore song, PAFF collapsed on stage. We have PAFF taken to the hospital already. A doctor is checking on her.

**Lynx87**<br>
Can you guys at the venue tell us what the hell happened!?

**PAFF-Official**<br>
PAFF is in a stable condition, nothing critical. She just hasn't woke up.<br>
We would like fellow fans to calm down. We will update you accordingly. 

**AnyClue**<br>
We are all still at the venue, no staff in sight and everything is a mess
