Disgusting, very disgusting

**AngryFan**<br>
Does not accept these kinds of behavior

**AbbEE**<br>
Definitely not a PUFFER, we know our place!

**IronFan**<br>
I feel like we need to single him out. The admins are probably going to give him a non-prosecution or something and let him off scot-free. What if he does it again?

**PAFF-Official**<br>
We would like fellow little Puffs to calm down. We don't do anything illegal!

**CeLiA**<br>
Must know your own place

**Lynx87**<br>
He keeps yelling that he is PAFF's friend, is he nuts or what?

**PoolsKitten**<br>
Arrest him! Arrest him! Arrest him!

**maplewing**<br>
Cuff him! Cuff him! Cuff him!

**SancTityKnight**<br>
Any updates?

**vvv_IRIS_vvv**<br>
Seems like it's not a fan, just some crazy dude

**iluvpuf**<br>
Wasn't that guy already arrested

**Chevalier151**<br>
So it's now up to the admins? I feel like he needs to feel the rage of the fans...

Can someone post the footage? The news footage is blurry and unrecognizable. Someone should have a clearer version.
