# [Annoucement] Explaining the decision behind the contract termination of PAFF
## Post
**PAFF-Official**<br>
To our dear fans and beloved customers,

Monophonic Entertainment Inc. signed Miss Aroma White to a contract back in 695. For the past seven years, ever since her performance debut under the name "PAFF", we have always treated everything regarding Miss White with the highest possible standards. We always try our best to give fellow fans the best experience.

After Miss White went missing without notice, we have also tried our utmost to search for her and handle the losses. However, her action is indeed a violation of her contract and has already caused the company a substantial amount of damage, including property damage, other contract artists getting injured and more. In addition, it has led to the mistrust between fellow fans and the company, something neither of us wants to see happen. 

Therefore, we hereby announce the following information to fellow fans and friends in the media: After taking all issues into consideration, we have reached an agreement with Miss White's agent, Miss Helena White. We will be terminating the contract between Monophonic Entertainment Inc. and Miss Aroma White, effective immediately. We will no longer be responsible for her future career as an artist. 

We wish Miss White the best of luck in her future. We will continue to work hard to create the highest quality of performance experience. We hope that fellow fans can continue supporting our other artists.

Sincerely<br>
Monophonic Entertainment

Dick move, Mono, dick move...<br>
You made all the money, lose an actual living person, gave us no clear explanation and now you terminate her contract when she is STILL MISSING???

**Poopytrap**<br>
Hiding behind all these big words... cowards!<br>
Why don't you just terminate yourself?  <br>

I've been waiting for news about PAFF every day and this is what I get in return...

**Shrimpyy**<br>
So you place property damage ahead of your artist getting injured...<br>
Even though "Not surprised, it's Mono", you people will never cease to amaze me at how disgusting you can be<br>

TBH I think they're pretty unlucky themselves... who knew that PAFF would disappear all of a sudden

**Varinaya**<br>
Dude, RUN! You can't just say the truth! The angry mob will come knocking with their flaming pitchforks!

Made loads of money with PAFF, yet one mistake and you immediately abandon her...<br>
Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. I will never spend another penny on anything with your name on it<br>

While I won't say it's entirely you guys' fault, this really does leave a bad taste in my mouth...

**Juggernaut**<br>
Boycott this BS!!!<br>
Boycott until the end of the world!

**Hatehate**<br>
Congratulations, Mono, you played yourself.<br>
Never seen a company that screws up as much as you folks<br>
Mono is dead to me, see you in hell

**TobeTobe**<br>
And you had the GALL to wish her best of luck at the end... when you don't even know if she's alive or not! I am so angry that I want to cry...<br>

So disappointed in you people. You don't deserve PAFF. Goodbye
