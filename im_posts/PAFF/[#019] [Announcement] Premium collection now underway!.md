Dear little Puffs, we have some good news for you~

To support PAFF, who is still recovering, Mono Music plans to produce a special premium collection for PAFF. It will record all her hard work and will contain her best songs throughout all these years!

Aaaanndd...in addition to behind-the-scenes and crossovers, we invited Monophonic Entertainment newcomers <br>
**@Cherry PuNK** to compose the songs, guaranteed to bring everyone a brand-new experience!

Please pay attention to **@PAFF-Official** and the upcoming updates!

We don't want premium collection; we want PAFF to be healthy!

**IronFan**<br>
Didn't she just return to the hospital for a check-up?

**Pascal626**<br>
Won't PAFF get too tired from this, did the doctor give permission? Why is the agency doing this to PAFF QQ

**HC**<br>
... I'll buy it

Who the hell is Cherry PuNK?

**AbbEE**<br>
Isn't this a bit too much work for PAFF? Is this Sis Helena's decision?

**Lynx87**<br>
Premium collections nowadays is likely handled by the companies..."likely"

As long as PAFF gets enough rest I don't mind. I am just worried. 

**SancTityKnight**<br>
What are they trying to promote some unknown newbie?

**Michiko**<br>
It's more important to let PAFF rest!

**koolboss01**<br>
But for someone like PAFF who cares so much about performance quality, it would be hard for her to stay completely out of this...

**CyKa**<br>
Don't work PAFF too much!!!

**LyLah1207**<br>
I really hope PAFF's body has recovered enough to handle this

**Chevalier151**<br>
We can only wait and see
