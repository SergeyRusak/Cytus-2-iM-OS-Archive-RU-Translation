# [Announcement] Activities suspended and rest
## Post
**PAFF-Official**<br>
Dear little Puffs, on the recommendation of the doctor, PAFF will be traveling to another Node to rest and rehabilitate.

Therefore all activities will be suspended for a while. For refund policies please visit the official site~

We hope that PAFF can recharge completely and return to the stage better than ever!
