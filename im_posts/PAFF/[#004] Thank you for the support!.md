Must be because PAFF works really hard! That's why she gets acknowledged by the judges. The sales are gonna go through the roof.

If these judges didn't give it a positive mark... I'll make them pay!

Nice taste from these judges

It would be odd if they are NOT positive about it

**CeLiA**<br>
Really? Awesome!

**IronFan**<br>
If PAFF doesn't get a positive score, nobody deserves one

The composers that help make the music this time are also very good. The music matches PAFF's voice perfectly
