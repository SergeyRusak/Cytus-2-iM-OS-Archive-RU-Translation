# I am very sorry to everyone

After the agency's statement, I feel that I should officially apologize to everyone here as well. 

Regarding the concealing of PAFF's situation. I understand that everyone is worried, panicked and angry. I am very sorry.

Since the incident really just came out of nowhere, I had no idea what to do as well. After discussing with the agency, we came to the conclusion that we should stay low for a while and see how things play out. Meanwhile, the agency immediately dispatched people to search for PAFF as well. 

This has been a very difficult time for me and other people who care about PAFF. We don't know why she suddenly decided to vanish, but I believe that right now she is in a state that needs us by her side the most. I truly hope that everyone can help us look for PAFF. If you have any information, feel free to tell me directly through this account. 

Last but not least, thank you for reading this entire post. I don't expect anyone to forgive me for what I've done, but I do at least hope that you can understand the struggles and sadness I experienced as her sister during this time.

Did you sell your younger sister to some shady organization

Dude shut up. Now's not the time for nonsense

If we're being critical, I feel that the way they handled this entire sage is...  flawed, and very, very questionable, to say the least

**Smurky**<br>
The entire Mono PR team should go home and kill themselves

We've been through worse situations than this. We'll be fine this time too :))))

**Muahaha**<br>
When you found out that she's missing from the hospital, why didn't you inform the police?
