Dear little Puffs, thank you for your support and encouragement through all this time.

Monophonic Entertainment is very sorry to announce that due to PAFF's personal health conditions, her《Around the Nodes》concert tour, which was originally scheduled to begin on 702/12/24, will be postponed indefinitely. We promise right here that all fans who purchased tickets will receive a full refund as long as they have the receipt. We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused.

The《Around the Nodes》concert tour is canceled due to multiple reasons. Monophonic Entertainment would like to sincerely apologize again to the fans, artists and all parties that are affected by this decision. We would like fans who already purchased tickets to contact the Monophonic ticketing system to apply for a refund. In addition to a full refund, we will also absorb all the extra handling costs during the refund process ourselves.

Details on the refunds are as follows:<br>
1. Expiration Date:<br>
From now till 702/10/30 (included). Time will be based on the Administration Bureau's time of connection. 

2. How to return the ticket:<br>
(A) For those who received a virtual ticket via internet pay:<br>
Based on the transaction data and the ID chip verification, we will automatically refund the cost of the ticket to the registered account. If you wish to change your registered information, please visit the link posted at point no.3.

(B) For those who received a physical ticket at a Monophonic Entertainment or other certified partners' physical store location:<br>
We will be distributing drones to each physical store location to help with the refund process.

Hold it, hold it right there! What we want is NOT refunds!!

**Michiko**<br>
In the end still no explanation at all for PAFF's current situation ˋ口ˊ

**koolboss01**<br>
PAFF, I won't ask for a refund. I want you to use our money to heal yourself

**An0nym0us**<br>
Should I say "Not surprised, it's Mono"?

**SancTityKnight**<br>
Link is completely dead. The so\-called "available 24/7" customer service system also have not responded at all. Available 24/7? More like absolute trash 24/7!!!

**Poopytrap**<br>
Dude, do you have too much money to throw at random crap? Maybe this is all a scam ya know

**vvv_IRIS_vvv**<br>
Mono officials, any announcements regarding the Æsir\-FEST incident?

**AbbEE**<br>
My god that's right<br>
Mono should know about Æsir\-FEST too<br>
Since they agreed to let PAFF be a guest performer

**koolboss01**<br>
Does your company want to give an explanation for ANYTHING

**CeLiA**<br>
This is not the Mono I used to know...

**HC**<br>
Calm down everybody. If you think about it, there's nothing wrong with how they are dealing with this

**AngryFan**<br>
Do you think that refunds will solve everything!!!?

**m00nl16h7**<br>
Where's Mono's CEO?<br>
Are you setting up a press conference to apologize for this mess?

**Chevalier151**<br>
Idiots refund is the only way they can handle a situation like this. What else are they gonna do

**IronFan**<br>
I'm so disappointed. I will not support you guys anymore in the future

**Mohito**<br>
Even though the news reports say that Æsir\-FEST was held, I still couldn't piece together my schedule that day

**NotScalper**<br>
It's great that we can ask for a refund. I bought 15 general admission tickets

**SuduMan**<br>
You must be a ticket scalper, right?

**PaffCheckin**<br>
I just paid a visit to the physical store locations around that area<br>
They said that they didn't receive any instructions from HQ<br>
Do you really have any intention to handle this situation properly?

**StuffyMouth**<br>
Don't really want to support Mono's events from now on. SkyEkho might be the better choice. They may be a smaller company, but look at the work they did with ConneR's concert; it was f\*\*\*\*\* awesome
