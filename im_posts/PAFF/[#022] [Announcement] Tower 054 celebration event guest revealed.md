Dear little Puffs, do you remember the rookie band **@Cherry PuNK** who composed a song for PAFF \~\~

Originally, PAFF was scheduled to participate in the Tower 054 new floor "108" 's opening celebration event. However, since she is still not feeling well, she is unable to be present at the event herself. She will be talking with everyone through a pre\-recorded video. Monophonic Entertainment also invited Cherry PuNK to be at the event as special guests!

After hearing that they will be performing in place of the still recovering PAFF, the members of Cherry PuNK have been practicing really hard. Everyone, please remember to acknowledge them and give them a huge round of applause!

So is this the fan page for that Strawberry Pink thing now?

**lrrllrrl**<br>
It's Cherry PuNK damnit. You're mistaking it on purpose aren't you lmfao

**MustangMartin**<br>
Click the post and I immediately thought I was on the wrong page

**noneXenon**<br>
Support Cherry PuNK \\oo/

**Hulujam**<br>
I mean, this was supposed to be PAFF's event. Since they're making a change, it's kinda reasonable for them to announce it here, right?

**Strawcherry**<br>
I think it's OK

**AngryFan**<br>
BOOOO!!! No PAFF!! BOOOOOOO!!

**Mohito**<br>
I see, so just news about some replacement team

**TreeNoAlice**<br>
If Cherry's there, I'll support it :))))

**IronFan**<br>
I remember in the last refund post I said that I will not support Mono's events ever again

**SancTityKnight**<br>
I don't think it's OK >"< Has Mono given up on PAFF

**Paffy**<br>
Just happen to be watching the rehearsal clip, for some reason PAFF just feels kinda...off?

**SuduMan**<br>
How so?

**Paffy**<br>
She looks like she's in good spirits, but it doesn't really match the description the officials gave us a while ago. Like she's supposed to be resting, but it just doesn't look that way

**Paffy**<br>
Also I'm getting some serious Déjà vu from some of the things she said. You guys help me figure this out:<br>
"Thank you to everyone for their support. I'm fine, nothing really serious" and " I hope that everyone is not affected by the false rumors out there. Please trust the agency's announcements"

**iluvpuf**<br>
Weren't these the things she said about a year ago on a Mono press conference explaining her "dating" rumors?

**maplewing**<br>
Dude why do you remember crap like this so clearly lol

**Paffy**<br>
OMG you're right! I just found the clip; it's exactly the same. Everything, from the expressions to the words, is the same!!!!!

**Mecha_Giga**<br>
Wait so that means?????

**EvilForce**<br>
More BS from Mono?

**MYMYM**<br>
There's a clip!! I'm gonna check it out\~\~\~\~\~\~

**TunaLee**<br>
Is it wrong to find love for Cherry PuNK in PAFF's dungeon
