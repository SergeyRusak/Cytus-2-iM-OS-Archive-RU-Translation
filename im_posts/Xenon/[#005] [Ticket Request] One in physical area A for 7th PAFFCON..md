Since I was so busy with work I missed the first chance to snap up a ticket. If you know anyone that has an extra ticket please contact me. Thanks.

I only have a ticket for virtual area A, is that OK? Get a bit sick every time I attend a virtual concert since Æsir\-FEST, so would like to sell my virtual ticket

**Xenon**<br>
If I still can't get anything until next week I'll buy your virtual ticket. Still prefer hearing it in person. The organizer this time, PA, is not exactly good at adjusting virtual sound field. Had a bad experience last time... thanks anyway.

I only have one for area C

**Xenon**<br>
Area C's location is terrible, so not an option right now. Thank you.

EHH shocked Xenon wants to go to PAFF's concert don't go. If you have a holiday, come and have fun with NEKO PLZ!! (ΦˋдˊΦ)

**Xenon**<br>
I just like her voice, that's it. What's your problem with her?

**Gearz_Igo**<br>
NEKO seems to know PAFF??

**Rob_Oto**<br>
Can't be right? Like they are from completely different circles

**Bit_Inex**<br>
Almighty **@ROBO\_Head** give us an answer lol

**ROBO_Head**<br>
Record: NEKO\#ΦωΦ came in contact with PAFF when she still at Monophonic Entertainment. ：l

**Wrinkleheart**<br>
OMG an actual answer! Almighty indeed!

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
NEKO said it before, don't want to repeat! I just don't like her!! (ΦˋдˊΦ)

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
NEKO will have a physical event as well and you all have to come (ΦˋдˊΦ)

**Xenon**<br>
I had a Jam session on your stream just a while ago. You threw our practice right out the window and went completely off track. 

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Teehee (

**Xenon**<br>
"Teehee" my ass. 

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Then I'll collab with **@ROBO\_Head** next time! (ΦωΦ)

**ROBO_Head**<br>
NEKO\#ΦωΦ's mixtape logic this Unit can't analyze.：l
