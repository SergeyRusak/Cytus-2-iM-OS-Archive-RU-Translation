Didn't think that I would be so busy that I wouldn't have time to post on iM, and that every time I post it's about things that I find very irritating.

I believe everyone has more or less seen the cover story of this issue's 08 Daily, some reports about my friends and me. 

For the record, I must declare that the motivation behind this report to be very, very questionable. If its purpose is to only provide a description of an event, then the absurd amount of misinformation mixed into the report is unforgivable. It has seriously affected the public image of my friends and me and has invaded the privacy of our lives.

First of all, NEKO's release is a legal procedure based entirely on the independent judgment of the law enforcement department. There is no way myself or even my company could influence their judgment by so\-called " relationships". The reporter attempted to direct the case to a presumption in which NEKO was guilty and was only able to escape legal procedures because of her influences. I find this false accusation to be very offensive and thoroughly uncomfortable. 

Second, my personal relationship situation is not what was made up in the report. Regarding the two females who were present on\-site that day, we are merely good friends right now. 

I hope that some media outlets can be aware of the quality of their reports and follow basic journalism ethics. This type of rumor\-mongering should not be allowed in the future.

I'm with you!! I was super p\*\*\*ed as well when I read that article; it's a load of BS

**xxScarlexx**<br>
I believe Xenon is not someone who would do something like that

**Gearz_Igo**<br>
Do you want to sue them?? I know a lawyer who specializes in dealing with cases like this

**noneXenon**<br>

**Gogossip**<br>
Probably indecent sexual relationships? There were witnesses of you dating and spending the night outside

**Axroid_Sona**<br>
Dude, watch your mouth. You better have proof before you say something like that or you're gonna get sued

**Brock3tt**<br>
You can't say that ARC's internet security department and the LED are completely unrelated organizations though<br>
There's a ton of cases out there where the two collaborated

**Nyd_Ans**<br>
Is there finally a crack in Xenon's facade LOLOL

**AngryMan**<br>
Chink in the armor XD

**SuperKY**<br>
If you look at Xenon's posts from another angle you'll notice that there's something seriously wrong about this guy

**KiwaHu**<br>
If you can't read then would you kindly f\*\*\* off pls

**Wrinkleheart**<br>
More and more retarded comments. Shouldn't you ban them

**RyanRii**<br>
It's pointless\~<br>
If you ban them, they say you're hiding something<br>
If you don't ban them, they just keep ignoring the post and spilling BS

**Quest_ION**<br>
Xenon we are here to support you \\x/

**AntiNEKO**<br>
You're quite the man though, getting together with two uber\-popular goddesses

**Pinevalley**<br>
He came out to issue a proper statement<br>
yet still a buncha idiots commenting nonsense

**Doubty**<br>
So what? Issuing a statement doesn't mean he did nothing wrong. Criminals issue statements all the time; doesn't mean a thing if they're still guilty

**Pixely99**<br>
Wow you're comparing gossip/fake news to criminal statements<br>
Did you s\*\*\* out your logic the last time you took a dump?

**Arya_Poke**<br>
There's plenty out there who would pretend they saw nothing when their idols did something wrong

**FindingCat**<br>
Should we boycott these terrible reports（￣へ￣）
