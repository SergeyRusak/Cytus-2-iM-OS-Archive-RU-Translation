Thank you to everyone who connected to the Live yesterday. <br>
Although the optic guitar went nuts due to connection, making it hard to control, the performance overall is a great success. <br>
Since this is a subscribers-only performance, there wasn't too much promotion beforehand. <br>
Those who didn't see it live don't have to worry. The performance has a holo-recording. It will be recreated on major platforms for everyone to see in a few days.<br>
It feels great to be able to share music with everybody in my spare time. See you guys next time. ：)
