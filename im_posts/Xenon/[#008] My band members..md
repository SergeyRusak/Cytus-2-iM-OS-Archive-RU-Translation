# My band members.
## Post
Xenon:<br>
Topic looks like something right out of a middle school essay. Whatever, today I would like to introduce my band members:

**Lead Singer - Xenon - V<br>
Guitar - Xenon (myself)<br>
Bass - Xenon - B<br>
Drums - Xenon - D**

All Codenames. TBH I wrote this post because I was surprised a lot of people didn't know the fact that:<br>
Members of Xenon, with the exception of myself, are all robots made by me. They perform based on their programming. There are no actual band members.<br>
I apologize if you had wild imaginations about the members' personalities.
