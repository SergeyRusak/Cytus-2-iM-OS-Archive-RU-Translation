# About the optic guitar.

Xenon:<br>
Some people may have seen my performance using the optic guitar. That's only a prototype, what do you guys think about the sound?

The purpose of this post is to inform you guys that a modified version is almost complete. Should survive the recording of an entire album. 

I fixed the problem of the UI crashing after just 10 minutes of play. The sound quality is enhanced by electromagnetic resonance since this guitar doesn't have a body. Can directly control overtones of over 24kHz so the sound is less stressful for the ears. It can simulate body and strings made from different materials as well 

All in all, look forward to seeing this baby in my next performance.

Oh BTW, some people keep telling me to mass produce this for sale. But I don't have plans for that so give up.
