Xenon:<br>
Was originally planning to stay on the surface for only half a year, but the IT at the Node Administration Bureau needs more help, so I had to stay for several more months before finally getting everything on track.

All in all, finally returned to a more comfortable working environment. Although I will miss my physical workshop, this does give me more time with the band.

...Please don't remind me of the carnage in my workshop after every single visit from you.

I'll find a new space in cyTus to put all the equipment. We can use that from now on.

Must be nice to be able to look outside the A.R.C. while you work. The view should be great

**Xenon**<br>
I can't see the outside from my office, but I do go to the observation deck during break.
