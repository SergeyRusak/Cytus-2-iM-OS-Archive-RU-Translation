Everyon remembered Æsir-FEST from half a year ago right?<br>
There have been many different theories on the internet, so I'm here to tell what I remembered:

I was also connected to the cyTus background system that day. I was monitoring the huge flow of server data (hence I was not on stage). Afterwards, the entire backstage and site blacked out. 

I recall that **@PAFF-Official** and **@ROBO\_Head** were invited as guests that day. 

Since I was working and was not paying attention to the performances, I want to ask: did the blackout occur before or after they took stage?

**@ROBO\_Head** Too hard to understand. How come there is a viewcount when there is no performance?

I don't remember PAFF taking the stage that day either

Didn't the blackout happen at the very start?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Wasn't simple case of **@Æsir** standing everyone up? (ΦωΦ)

**Xenon**<br>
You were not there, stop making things more complicated OK?

I remembered that it was super dark after the blackout, like do blackouts usually go completely pitch black??

**Pumpkinforest**<br>
Æsir did take the stage right? I somehow have an impression that he played a song despite there being no lights

**Fu7ureW0rld**<br>
BS how do you play song when there's no power??

How come what I remembered was that the entire event was just canceled?
