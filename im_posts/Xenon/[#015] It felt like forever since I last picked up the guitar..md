# It felt like forever since I last picked up the guitar.

Xenon:<br>
Visited my long-forgotten workshop to take a quick breather between jobs, only to discover that a  thick layer of dust had gathered on the equipment. The strings on the optic guitar were all rusty as well. <br>
This personal account has always existed for the sole purpose of sharing music. However, recently, I've just been tangled up in too many baffling incidents and had to deal with way too many nonsensical people. All that has caused music to be pushed to the sidelines for quite some time now. The originally simple motivation has also been covered in dust, similar to the guitar.<br>
This situation might still continue for a while. To the people who have been supporting and looking forward to my music, I can only apologize from the bottom of my heart...

A special promotional shoutout here for **@ROBO\_Head** and his upcoming event <br>
[ROBO\_Radio\_LIVE]<br>
Seeing so many friends in the music industry participate in this event does make me a bit envious, since I couldn't join them. Unfortunately, I just couldn't find the time to prepare a performance. What a shame.<br>
Still, a sincere thank you for the invitation. <br>
Wish the event a great success.

Is it because of all the incidents regarding cyTus a while back? The connection quality these days seems to have a lot of issues as well<br>
Uninvited trouble one after another... Thanks for the Hard work, X

**11IIll11**<br>
Ah, is it because everyone now knows you're a two-timing Piece of S\*\*\*?. You don't seem to be sorry about it either, worthless hack

**Quest_ION**<br>
Your comment shows the level of your intelligence and it seems to be somewhere around "bottom of the barrel"<br>
Good work Xenon; will look forward to your new songs

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Hey, I came up with a great idea! NEKO will write the songs for you! You on board for that ~(\*Φ∀Φ)<br>
The《Return》we previously wrote together is REALLY amazing (\*Φ∀Φ)

**ROBO_Head**<br>
Analysis:《Black Hole》active streams in cyTus Lobby 17% higher than《Return》<br>
Looking forward to the next collaboration with **@Xenon** ：)

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
I don't need this kind of comparison!!!  \\(Φˋ口ˊΦ)/

**Xenon**<br>
**@ROBO\_Head** I will finish up the troublesome work I currently have as soon as possible. If you have any new ideas, send them my way.  I sure can use some composing to take a break from work.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
EHHHHH What do you mean by this!? Why did you only reply to Ropohead and not NEKO!? (Φˋ皿ˊΦ)

**AntiMetal**<br>
All this useless fluff,  just who the heck are you dating now? 08 Daily would love to hear the truth from you Mr. X

**CeeJay**<br>
Why would so many people lower their standards to the level of paparazzi nonsense... All in all, reported

**JOEZ Cafe**<br>
Stay happy, my man. If you have time, come to the shop and relax

**Xenon**<br>
Thanks. I will if I have the time.
