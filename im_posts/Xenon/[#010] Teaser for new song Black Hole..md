**@ROBO\_Head** Still fixing Æsir-FEST's data? You've been at it for too long. 

**ROBO_Head**<br>
Use of "Too long" negative. <br>
Damage to this level this Unit top 5% in recovery speed among users of this model of memory cell. ：l

Ahh that sucks. Every time ROBO performs in a virtual space it's ultra sparkling, to a point where it's almost seizure inducing! XD

**Jiwa77**<br>
Seizures LOL

**ArupakaKUN**<br>
On a side note, I was wondering is **@ROBO\_Head** a real person or a robot? Because he seems way too smart for a robot!

**ROBO_Head**<br>
This Unit is a robot. : )

**Bit_Inex**<br>
You'll always get the same answer from him ROFL
