Finally have more time to write new songs and organize the next performance. Been getting a lot more inspirations after returning to A.R.C.

This is a collab project with **@NEKO\#ΦωΦ**. Song title "Return" to celebrate my return to the skies. Hope everyone likes it.

Ehhh!? If I knew this song was this important<br>
NEKO would have spent more time fine-tuning it (Φ艸Φ)

It's ok, I think you did a great job on your parts.

A bummer that we didn't have chance to record a Solo with the optic guitar; been wanting to test its sound.
