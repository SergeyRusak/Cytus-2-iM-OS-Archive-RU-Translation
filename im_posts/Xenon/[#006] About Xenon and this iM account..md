**Xenon**<br>
It's been three years since I started creating content under the name Xenon. Most people probably followed this personal account because of the music. 

The reason I didn't use the official account for promotion is simple; because I just want to share music with you guys. Not for fame or money.

If the music I write in my spare time, be it happy, angry or touching music, can resonate with some people, that will be the biggest comfort in my life. 

Quite a few of you may know that I work at A.R.C. as an IT, but I would like to keep this account free from my work stuff. This place is just for music.

Isn't having milk in my shop your biggest comfort in life?

**Xenon**<br>
What's wrong with ordering milk at a bar?

JOE and Xenon's duo\-Solo was amazing, never seen a band that can live up to that.

**Gearz_Igo**<br>
Indeed! Never though Bass can keep up with Xenon's guitar!

**JOE**<br>
All past glory. I'm too old for this now haha

**Bit_Inex**<br>
Xenon doesn't seem to like talking about the ex\-band QwQ

**Xenon**<br>
Don't actively avoid it, just felt like it was too long ago. 

**Xenon**<br>
Maybe it's because the Bassist is too gross for me to keep playing. 

**JOE**<br>
