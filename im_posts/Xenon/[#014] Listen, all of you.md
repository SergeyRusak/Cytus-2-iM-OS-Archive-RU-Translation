Right now, pointless protest and/or sabotage will only bring trouble on yourselves. Surrounding Mono HQ is a nonsensical and dumb idea in the first place. 

As you know, someone already got injured. You people really think that resorting to violence and being the loudest voice in the crowd will justify your actions? All this blind emotion will only make you look like a bunch of uncivilized monkeys. 

Think carefully about what you want to achieve before actually making a move. Or else, it would be too late to regret your decisions.

An angry Xenon is still so cool \\x/\\x/\\x/

I think it’s ok to express your opinions, but it is definitely wrong to injured others, not to mention it's someone innocent

**TreeNoAlice**<br>
Good work Xenon Orz

Xenon's trying to offer some helpful advice, ended up attracting a whole bunch of haters @@

**Wrinkleheart**<br>
I find those who resort to violence utterly detestable<br>
They are making everyone on-site look horrible, even the reasonable fans who just want a proper answer

**Pinevalley**<br>
Nah, reasonable fans don't exist anymore. Even if they do, they are the extreme minority imo

**NathaN**<br>
I was watching my friend streaming<br>
He said that the crowd on-site is mixed with many different people, some definitely not just "fans"

**RamenBot**<br>
F\*\*\*! Plenty of folks don't know WTF is up yet still went there to cause trouble<br>
Bunch of f\*\*\*\*\* idiots

**Quest_ION**<br>
Xenon, are really not going to block those hater comments...

**4nonymous**<br>
Mr. Xenon, I started following you after the recent NEKO news (To see how much of a POS you are of course)<br>
Before you criticize others, shouldn't you take a good look in the mirror first?

**GymGai**<br>
Heard you're played multiple instruments during your band days, no wonder you're this good at playing two girls <br>

**AntiNEKO**<br>
Music doesn't make you bad, it just makes you a hypocrite

**lenba**<br>
If you just want to be a hater behind the screen then please shut the f\*\*\* up

**TunaLee**<br>
You shouldn’t take retards who trust info from stupid gossip magazines seriously
