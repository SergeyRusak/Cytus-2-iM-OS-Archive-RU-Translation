> PAFF's agent Helena: "We appreciate the passionate support from fans. However, we would also like everyone to control themselves and not harm PAFF."<br>
Personally, I really like PAFF, but even I won't go creating a commotion like this.

I was there live, it was a huge mess XD

That guy doesn't look like a fan to me. Maybe it's mental problems; he seems to mistake PAFF for someone he knows

Though Node08 is pretty safe, but stuff like this still happens.<br>
Though I've seen more maniacs at my performances.

The no.1 maniac in your performances is definitely **@NEKO\#ΦωΦ**. Last time, she poured drinks all over Robohead, LMFAO

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
That was an accident!<br>
Also "Node08 is pretty safe", really? A few days ago, NEKO was knocked down by a mad fan looking for a signature!!  <br>
All you do is care about PAFF! NEKO is sad.･ﾟ･(つдΦ)･ﾟ･

**Xenon**<br>
I was worried if she was injured.

**TreeNoAlice**<br>
Both of you are too famous seems like you run into crap like this everyday XDD

**EvilForce**<br>
If you want to prevent this just don't show your face at all, like ROBO and Xenon lol

**noneXenon**<br>

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
