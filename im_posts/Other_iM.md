A.R.C.'s mechanical pets are already pretty amazing. They act almost exactly the same as real animals. A while ago my friend's MeowBot got ran over by a car; she cried so hard that I really believe it's an actual pet that died

Does the nausea just pop up randomly? or do they appear under certain circumstances?

Yes! It only occurs during virtual connections. Every time I get this Déjà vu feel, not sure if it's music I've heard or scenes I've seen. Then the nausea starts.

That Colin Neumann Jr. guy that A.R.C. just hired as an advisor, wasn't he arrested by the admins ten years ago for trespassing into the Ruins? Why would A.R.C. get someone with such a questionable resume?
### Replies
**Mecha_Giga**<br>
The fact is that the "trespassing into Ruins" thing only applies in Node08, hence the headlines back then. Other Nodes don't give a damn about people wandering into the Ruins. If you ask me, I think A.R.C. has more problems with all the shady stuff with the admins.

**Rabbitdora**<br>
I mean, the admins have no business dealing with stuff outside the Node area right lol

**RamenBot**<br>
Is his trespassing something to do with the hospital?

**SoundOfF**<br>
You can look into the news archives of this guy. For several years, all breakthroughs A.R.C. made happened because of him XD

**Juggernaut**<br>
You mean writing papers that utterly destroyed A.R.C.'s "research"? Hahaha.

**Mohito**<br>
He went missing for several years, recently he started a new account for music purposes I think

Although it's a bit weird to give this tip on iM, I would advise everyone to control their time using the internet. <br>
Recently, there has been a significant increase in patients who visit us due to discomfort caused by virtual connections. We have categorized them as victims of an internet addiction syndrome.<br>
No matter how advanced technology has become, using the virtual connection for a long period of time will still cause a certain level of stress to the brain. Please take good care of your body.
### Replies

Agreed. Many of my friends are like that and their memory is getting worse

**NerfThat**<br>
I'm so scared that I'm keeping my surfing time to under 2 hours per session...

What should we do if we are already affected??

**Dr. Hawkins**<br>
As of now, there is no complete cure for faltering in memory/balance and cognitive disorders. Patients with serious symptoms sometimes fall into a coma.

Just like the past, failure in eyesight due to overuse of electronic products is also incurable. Therefore before we discover a complete solution, I can only give tips like this to prevent these symptoms from happening in the first place.

Think about it, what if Æsir\-FEST is also a part of their experiments? Maybe the admins already now, but still allow it to happen because of mysterious reasons?

A.R.C.'s core principle is to maximize technology development. It sounds fine and dandy by saying that it's "for the sake of humanity", but in fact they may still want to control everything, right? The two\-to\-three\-hour memories of millions of people seem like an insignificant sacrifice under these ideals.

**Andy_Roid**<br>
This sounds way too much like a conspiracy theory. I mean, what benefit does this bring them?

He went completely nuts and started slurring his native language nonstop. Oh and he ate bananas with his bare hands

He peeled the entire banana (like the whole thing) and grabbed it with his bare hands then started swinging it around like he's Donkey Kong on crack. I... I can't...

I woke up in the middle of the night yesterday only to find myself sleeping on the lobby floor. Why did nobody wake me up!!!

Because after you got drunk, you were running around like a madman and literally sticking your face to other people's faces when they were trying to talk to you!!!

Mono probably thinks that this is none of their business anymore, don't they? They see that they can't handle the situation, so they terminate the contract and abandon her.

**Vicky**<br>
A few days ago, popular streamer NEKO\#ΦωΦ, who was acquitted of all charges for her involvement in the infamous hacking incident, has returned to her home. Previously, this paper caught sight of one\-man band leader Xenon and CherryPuNK lead vocalist Cherry accompanying her as she left the Bureau. Today, there has been a new update to the situation. 

Yesterday afternoon, Xenon left his home alone. After cautiously looking around, he rode his motorcycle directly to a civilian household on 07 street in Quadrant II. That household turned out to be NEKO's home. According to photos taken by our reporter on\-site, Xenon was welcomed into the house by NEKO's family and went directly to her room. For around 20 minutes, the two stayed in her room, alone. The lights were turned off, making it impossible for us to determine what they were up to. As sunset approached, Xenon did not stay for dinner. After a quick chat with NEKO at the doorway, he left on his motorcycle. 

The other female in this love triangle, Cherry, was accidentally injured during the recent protests in front of Mono HQ. At the time of this visit, she was resting in the hospital. Xenon chose not to visit her at the time; instead, he chose to visit NEKO at her home. Does this mean that he finally made his decision? Or is he still wandering between the two and playing his dangerous game of love? For more behind\-the\-scenes information on this case, please follow 08 Daily. We will continue providing updates on the situation.

I was there on\-site for all of the previous riots. I was indeed quite p\*\*\*ed off at first. When the admins started interfering, I was also furious because I don't know why they were helping Mono with their shady businesses. However, I do feel like we were the ones to blame for injuring an innocent artist too. We can't just pretend that everything is Mono's fault.

I know that I might get a lot of hate for this, but we should all calm down and think about this carefully imho

To our dear fans and precious customers,

First of all, Monophonic Entertainment would like to congratulate the recently concluded ROBO\_Radio\_LIVE for its overwhelming success. To allow people who love music to all come together and share the emotions is also one of the main goals of Monophonic Entertainment when it was established. 

For the past few days, we've also received a lot of messages from the media and fans about the current contract situation between Cherry PuNK and Monophonic. We will use this opportunity to explain that here as well.

Cherry PuNK's lead vocalist Cherry is still under contract with Monophonic Entertainment, who acts as her album publishing firm as well as her performance agency. The incident this time, where an artist accepted a performance invitation in private, gave us a direct experience of how much the fans adore Cherry. However, we also want to devote all of Monophonic's resources to every single Cherry PuNK performance to make the event even more incredible than it already was. We want our fans to experience the ultimate feast to the eyes and ears. Therefore, the entire Monophonic staff was slightly disappointed when we couldn't participate in ROBO\_Radio\_LIVE together with Cherry. 

Monophonic Entertainment will not pursue legal actions regarding this incident. We also promise everyone that we will continue to improve ourselves so we can create even better spaces for performing and composing. Please continue to follow and support us. Thank you.

Monophonic Entertainment<br>
Entire staff

Nah they're just whining. It really hard to boycott Mono, it's not like boycotting one or two artists will actually cause them any harm

Cherry's the one who violated the contract this time, yet they act as if she has done nothing wrong lol

Hey man, are you getting paid for that comment?<br>
Better get your boss to treat you to lunch or something

Discover the secrets, painstaking investigation: Æsir\-FEST event report series Part 4

After reading parts 1 \~ 3 of our in\-depth coverage reports, we believe that everyone now has a better understanding regarding the ins and outs of the entire  Æsir\-FEST incident.<br>
In this report, 08 Daily will be shifting the focus from the mysterious Æsir to another person who's deeply connected with this incident. If you are a loyal reader of our magazine, our follow\-up report regarding the hacking incident of the streamer NEKO should still ring a bell. That's right! The focus of today's report has multiple key identities, including back\-end system administrator of A.R.C., rumored current boyfriend of NEKO and Ex\-boyfriend of Cherry PuNK main vocalist Cherry, Xenon (Real name: Simon Jackson). 

"The mysterious renegade! The legendary hacker "X", who robs the rich and gives to the poor! An underground punisher that lurks in the shadows of the internet!" It's safe to assume that readers who are born in the 680s are all quite familiar with this urban legend that was all the rage on the traditional internet. Not long after "X" disappeared from the internet, his real identity was quickly exposed to be the then 15 year\-old\-only Simon Jackson! Even though Simon, who was already starting to focus on composing music, never openly acknowledged this secret identity back from his years as a student, that didn't stop him from garnering a massive following and popularity on the internet. After he joined the underground band Crystal PuNK, it also took the music world by storm in what seems like the blink of an eye.

Despite his achievements in music, Xenon never abandoned his talents in computer technology. As a high school dropout, he was able to return to school and graduated. Not long after his graduation, he joined A.R.C.'s internet security department and participated in the establishment of many of the current internet security protocols and regulations. Why did A.R.C., an organization that was quite notorious for their attention to their applicants' educational background, allow Xenon, a former high school dropout, to join such a crucial department? It's impossible to not be suspicious of such a decision.

According to the information leaked to our news center by an insider, Xenon's role and administrative power in A.R.C. are much more complicated than what they announced to the public. He is not your average system administrator. He is someone who has unrestricted access to any block and is practically a god to the internet. In addition, as someone who is very familiar with all the regulations and protocols, he can also easily bypass any encrypted... (Read more)

I get a feeling that this magazine has been keeping an eye on Xenon a lot these days. Is it just me?

I feel like the tone of 08 Daily's reports is a bit biased. Like from the beginning, the reporter's attitude is always one where she's trying hard to dig up some dirt about X, or at least it seems that way.<br>
Like, it's very noticeable in her previous report about picking up NEKO from the Bureau too. I don't think a reporter should have a presumption like that, or is that just me??<br>
Although I am a bit surprised by the things Xenon did as a teenager, isn't that pretty cool as well?<br>
It's like a superhero saving the world! Something every regular civilian (me included) would love to do!

Isn't Xenon the most suspicious one ever since this whole incident started???<br>
This issue of 08 Daily stated that too<br>
He's a computer genius who started to display his talents at a very young age<br>
He personally established many security regulations and protocols after he joined A.R.C.<br>
During Æsir\-FEST he was allegedly (according to himself) monitoring the internet back\-end at A.R.C.<br>
He knows NEKO very well so it shouldn't be difficult at all for him to hack into her stream<br>
Every single case that he's involved in so far have become unsolved mysteries<br>
The answers don't get more obvious than that, right?<br>
These days on iM the issues of random garbled text and deleted comments have also been increasing<br>
Could it be that these are side effects of him tampering with the virtual internet in the past??

I was really angry that all we get is a template announcement about the system being fixed

I'm a registered nurse at hospital 15<br>
In this day and age, most medical systems are connected to the cyTus system<br>
There is a central system that universally oversees everything on each floor<br>
When the whole system broke down this time, it was a manpower shortage catastrophe for the entire hospital<br>
Not to mention the many patients on the intensive care floors who relied on life support systems just to stay alive<br>
All of them gone in a snap of the finger. We didn't even have time to save them

I realize that this was a very serious accident<br>
However, the cyTus system is already this crucial to human society<br>
Shouldn't ARC shoulder a bit more social responsibility?

At the very least, we have the right to know more secrets, right?

Same here, waiting for answers

**Snor_eDen**<br>
I'm a random engineer who happens to pass by. I've been chasing the recent internet issues for some time now. I am certain that this is definitely not some accident by chance. Instead, someone is purposely manipulating the system

**CHanatsuka**<br>
Don't stop halfway through. It's making me anxious

**Snor_eDen**<br>
Does everyone still remember the performance hosted by ROBO\_Head a while ago? During that event, there were a lot of ghost connections eating up the data flow which completely ruined the live stream's quality. I've been investigating this stuff since that event. I discovered that a lot of the encrypted addresses share similar characteristics. Therefore, I can make a reasonable speculation that this is the act of one person or one organization.

**Snor_eDen**<br>
In addition, the recent garbled text and blank comments, the massive malfunction in the past few days, I also found that some of the interference came from the same encrypted address I mentioned above. I believe you guys understand where I'm going with this

**Kemcoter**<br>
Dude what you said was terrifying AF. So there really was a powerful mastermind behind all this?<br>
But, only some sort of super hacker is capable of doing such a thing, right??

**66TAN66**<br>
Engineer passing by, please save us!!

**Krypton**<br>
Wait, this is looking like a case where the admins need to interfere. **@Snor\_eDen** Should we report it

> We have received the latest news. Just earlier today, A.R.C. backend administrator Simon Jackson has been arrested in A.R.C. by law enforcement agents. Our sources show that he is none other than the biggest suspect for "Æsir", the mastermind behind the recent string of internet crime incidents. <br>
> <br>
> According to our inside sources, the Administration Bureau received investigative information from an A.R.C. employee. The employee accused Simon Jackson of using a specialized A.I. that has yet to clear safety protocols for all kinds of operations. The Administration Bureau decided to delve further into the situation. However, when they came across A.R.C.'s system program records, they discovered a large number of commands used by said A.I. to commit internet crimes, which even includes the infamous cyberterrorism incident during a live stream a few months ago. All this evidence are proof of Simon Jackson's highly possible association with Æsir. <br>
> <br>
> Faced with such serious accusations, Simon Jackson did not say a single word to defend himself, nor attempted to prove his innocence. Instead, he appeared at the Bureau with law enforcement agents and has been very cooperative throughout the process. We are currently chasing this news in real\-time and will update you with the latest information at any time.

\[Entertainment\]\[Cherry PuNK\]\[Concert\]<br>
> In a recent performance of the popular band Cherry PuNK, lead vocalist Cherry appeared to suffer some serious mismanagement regarding her personal schedule. She was absent for almost 30 minutes before hastily taking the stage to complete the performance. Although her performance is still up to her usual standards, her actions at the start left quite the bad taste. Many audience members criticized her, calling this "The most absurd concert" they've ever seen. <br>
> <br>
> Cherry's late arrival occurred at a charity concert held at Node 08's Central Park. Many audience members actually waited in line overnight just to catch a glimpse of their idol, yet they were slapped with a near\-30 minute no\-show. Many thought that this was an organized warmup event by the band at first, which led to plenty of complaints. Some fans took to iM to express that Cherry is nowhere near as nice and professional as others have described. Their reasoning is that she didn't even bother to explain why she was late. She just hopped on stage and performed till the end as if nothing has happened. <br>
> <br>
> However, the day following the concert, fan club president CherryMyLife (iM account name) made a statement after contacting Cherry's agent and other band members to understand the situation. He stated that the real reason behind the delay was because Cherry had to deal with a family emergency that suddenly came up. Knowing how disappointed the fans would be of her absence, Cherry rushed to Central Park as fast as she could once she finished addressing the emergency.<br>
> <br>
> Cherry didn't cancel her performance even in the face of an unforeseeable situation. After this information surfaced, her dedication and work ethic immediately received praise from fans and netizens once again, claiming that Cherry is indeed "Node 08 rock's last hope". Praises like "Cherry is the best person I've ever seen.", "We don't deserve Cherry PuNK.", "This is why I will always love her." "Only Cherry can surpass Cherry" can be seen everywhere.

Our hospital got hit really hard in this incident<br>
It's like we drew the short straw on every single occasion<br>
Any device that requires connection got wiped out pretty much entirely<br>
Many patients in intensive care or has special diseases, unfortunately, passed away because of this <br>
(Surprisingly, there were also some patients whose symptoms got better)<br>
Just suddenly realize how severe the risks can be when we are so overly reliant on a singular system<br>
ARC did send someone later to discuss compensation with the higher\-ups of the hospital<br>
However, it all just felt too late...

Even though you should already feel numb to life and death since you're in a hospital, stuff like this still makes me very upset

**in9odwetrust**<br>
Good work to all the doctors

**AaA**<br>
Thank you to all the doctors who held their posts in such a time of crisis

**BbB**<br>
Are there any ways we can give donations to the victims' families??

**Tracix**<br>
Wait, so no backup system at all for such delicate equipment?? QAQ

**Andy_Roid**<br>
ARC had better shell out some serious money for this screw\-up

**StuffyMouth**<br>
So there were people who got better??

**9tingale**<br>
Yes, patients with Virtual\-Internet Related Post\-Traumatic Stress Disorder

**Wickedragon**<br>
9tingale, have you ever thought about becoming a knowledge\-type streamer?<br>
I've always found your articles to be professional and useful

**Mimosa_droid**<br>
You can call yourself Miss Doctor or something

**Neon_raven**<br>
There are so many things wrong with that I won't even bother to correct you<br>
Dr. 9tingale would be a much better title

**IronFan**<br>
I support that\~\~\~\~\~\~

**kou**<br>
A prayer to all those who passed away \*Pray\*. May they all rest in peace

**Arayray**<br>
Back then when the internet broke down, I thought to myself "OH, crap." Nowadays, so many services and systems are deeply tied to the internet. It's guaranteed chaos if anything happens to it. And what do we know?

**Henry**<br>
All my bank services also got completely wiped out that day\~\~\~\~<br>
The money I transferred is still lost in the void

**Snor_eDen**<br>
If anyone needs help. feel free to contact me. I'll see what I can do.

**UltraKY**<br>
I feel like there's absolutely a loophole in the user agreement<br>
No way in hell would they ever compensate the whole amount!!!<br>
**\#ARCWillPay**

**Gogossip**<br>
By "getting better", do you mean that they woke from their coma??

**9tingale**<br>
Their brainwaves have returned to normal intervals<br>
But the reason why we noticed this is that there actually were patients who regained their consciousness<br>
It's a bit like they suddenly woke up from a deep sleep<br>
However, it's only for that brief time period, so we can't really call this a cure

**Krypton**<br>
If that's the case, maybe you should inform ARC about this too

**Henry**<br>
Maybe not now, as I bet they are currently in complete chaos trying to handle all the compensation and insurance stuff

> The series of internet terrorist attacks related to the infamous Æsir\-FEST has been the talk of the Node. Prime suspect Simon Jackson (Internet ID: Xenon) was arrested a few days ago. Despite refusing to explain his involvement with the cases at first, after several nights of interrogation, we've received information that he has finally given up and pleaded guilty, stating that he is indeed the mastermind behind everything: Æsir.<br>
> <br>
> According to an anonymous source from within the Administration Bureau, Simon Jackson stated during interrogation: " Under a condition where a certain purpose exists in the subconscious, I may have used my computer technology skills to convert the theoretical thought of stealing memories into practical actions. Even though my memory is still in a rather chaotic state, I will not rule out the possibility that I fabricated this Æsir identity and used it to commit criminal acts."<br>
> <br>
> The source also points out that the higher\-ups at A.R.C., where Simon Jackson is previously employed at, have also dispatched key figures to assist the Administration Bureau in acquiring more evidence. This is also to ensure that there are no hidden accomplices or other potentially dangerous factors that may lead to another incident.

I don't think this is a crime that deserves that severe of a punishment

You never know there were quite a few indirect deaths caused by the malfunction of the internet, gotta take that into account too

Or is that just your personal speculation?

Æsir (I think it should be fair to directly call him Simon or Xenon now)<br>
is totally a legendary performance artist\~\~\~\~\~

When he debuted, he only distributed music on the internet for free: A rebellious attitude to the pop music industry that only cares about money

Invited famous artists to host a completely free Live performance: A symbol that music has no borders and should be accessible to everyone

At the end of the Live, erase everyone's memory and take it away: A sign that artists have absolute control over their own work

Hacking of an annoying streamer: A warning to ignorant brats. The world of the internet is not a place for you naive children to be messing around in

Real identity discovered: Everything turns out to be planned by the seemingly self\-righteous and self\-proclaimed "defender of justice" Xenon. A lesson that tells everyone to not trust shallow and egotistical truths so easily

If nobody dies within 30 minutes, all players are then declared winners<br>
Something like that???

**JAC-jack**<br>

**moonin**<br>
This is not battle royale anymore<br>
Should call it the peaceful royale

**vveay**<br>
If we go by human nature,<br>
there should be a group of people who consider themselves "righteous" and "fair". They will take away all the weapons first to "manage" them

**STANley**<br>
Then they will start attacking and downing those players that "feel" very dangerous to them

**SYY**<br>
In the end, in order to determine who is truly "dangerous", a conflict will break out and people will start bashing each other's brains in with the weapons

**lrrllrrl**<br>
Wait, then we're reverting back to an actual battle royale again WTH XDDDD

> According to our sources, in the middle of last night, several armed people broke into the restricted area. Their target was the prime suspect of the Æsir\-FEST incident Simon Jackson (Internet ID: Xenon), who was still in custody. Even though the Administration Bureau has stated that they will be holding a press conference to explain the situation once they sort out the details, it is almost certain that as of now, Simon Jackson is no longer under the control of the Administration Bureau.<br>
> <br>
> According to private interviews conducted by our reporter, the perpetrators' planning of this jailbreak operation was very carefully thought out. In addition to distracting the guards with words, they also destroyed more than a dozen armed drones. Fortunately, no casualties were found. Whether this was caused by the Administration Bureau's lack of discipline or the perpetrators being simply too skilled and well\-prepared remains to be determined. Right now, we can only wait patiently for the results of the investigation.

As long as Xenon has a PC, no one, and I mean no one, can keep him locked up

Bulls\*\*\* who in the right mind would give him a PC?<br>
It's like telling him "Please hacks us and break out of here"

**Go55ip**<br>
I have a suggestion <br>
We should hide in the bushes around Cherry or NEKO's house. I'm sure he'll show up some day lol

**4nonymous**<br>
A few people were all it took to break him out? What the f\*\*\* are the admins doing??? God they are useless

if the perpetrators can destroy over a dozen drones, I'm certain that they must be professionals in the business

From the fans' violent protest regarding Monophonic Entertainment's mistreatment of her disappearance; to the information discovered during the Æsir\-FEST investigations that linked PAFF's deteriorating health to a possible memory theft she suffered during the incident and more. Just as everyone is about to give up on the search for her, the case took a very surprising and drastic turn today. <br>

> Earlier today, in Node 08 Tower, multiple pedestrians caught sight of PAFF together with well\-known streamer NEKO. However, the two quickly passed through the crowd and proceeded to disappear. Only a few witnesses were able to get out their mobile devices in time to capture some blurry photos. We are currently contacting Monophonic Entertainment and the Administration Bureau to confirm the details on this event.

I'm stuck in a mall now. Just now, there were drones attacking the doors. There were screams and chaos. Luckily, the courageous people who worked at the mall thought fast and managed to get the blast\-proof doors up in time, which stopped the drones from getting in. But now we can't get out either. <br>
Looks like more and more drones are gathering outside. What should we do??

For real, I think ARC wants to use this opportunity to take back the control of all drones that previously belonged to the admins

**fotoistruth**<br>
I'm thinking the exact opposite. I think the admins don't want ARC to have too much power. Therefore, they're making people cautious regarding technology. This way, folks won't rely on ARC tech and products too much

**TunaLee**<br>
Hey dumba\*\*<br>

Hello everybody, this is Paff's older sister Helena White

First, I'd like to thank all of you for your support and encouragement you've given since PAFF went missing. If it weren't for all your passion and consolation, I don't know if I'd still be here today. Also, I'd like to especially thank anyone who has provided tips and assistance in finding PAFF.

PAFF has contacted us in the past few days and we now know that she is both safe and has trustworthy friends by her side. Since a lot of complicated things have happened, it's not possible to explain them all here, so I am very sorry about that. I feel like she needs some time to collect herself too. Therefore, I  just want to inform everybody that there is no longer any need to search for PAFF, so please refrain from asking for her exact whereabouts. Whether or not she will return to the stage as an idol singer is entirely up to her. If she ever makes a decision, we will announce it.

Thank you, everyone, for being with us all this time. The pain that has been felt cannot be forgotten, but everything we have now means the world to us. Thank you.

The video message above is a message to all of you recorded by PAFF herself. Hope everyone can feel at ease now.

Helena White

This error caused the system to mistakenly sent unrelated commands to the drones which caused them to malfunction and act abnormally. We've already activated the security protocol. This will increase the patrol frequency of armed Law Enforcement Agents, as well as improve the anti\-drone capabilities of Enforcer Drones."<br>

> <br>
> At around 3 P.M., the first wave of attacks struck a Law Enforcement patrol post in the outskirts of Quadrant II. Multiple citizens and Law Enforcement Agents suffered minor and critical injuries. Of the critically injured, three already showed no signs of life by the time medical personnel arrived at the site. A witness of the attack told this NNN reporter, that after the first wave of attacks, the remaining drones continued to head toward the business district, most likely preparing for the next attack.<br>

> Since these incidents showed clear signs of a terrorist attack, the Administration Bureau has issued an order for first\-priority precautionary measures to be taken. All Law Enforcement Agents will be deployed to conduct the investigation. In addition, the flying permits for all drones that are on standby have been revoked. However, drones that are currently conducting missions or offline are still out of their control. If the situation calls for it, these drones will be destroyed or brought down by force.<br>

As of now, the Administration Bureau has sealed off all traffic routes entering and exiting that area. Anyone who passes through the area, including pedestrians traveling on foot, must undergo examinations before they can proceed ahead. <br>

> Node 08's business district is a hub area that has always been the most bustling place in 08. Notable landmarks such as Monophonic Entertainment HQ, Central Music Hall, and the Live House District were all affected by the attack to varying degrees. Fortunately, when the attack occurred, most stores had yet to start their business for the day. However, some stores were not as fortunate. For example, the Old Town area, home to the Jazz Bar "JOEZ Cafe" and the renowned Department Store "The Fountains", was pretty much reduced to rubble. The dining street, which houses famous restaurants like "Pizzattic" and "Singularity", also didn't survive the attack and was destroyed almost entirely.<br>
> <br>
> According to the Administration Bureau, in contrast with the previous sporadic drone malfunctions, this incident was very clearly a targeted attack. There were even instances where large drones crashed into buildings while carrying energy cells or fuel. These cases of suicide attacks have resulted in at least a dozen high\-rise buildings suffering structural damage. Official sources have yet to confirm whether this attack was caused by terrorists or not.

Ummm, h\-hey guys\~\~ I'm still alive haha\~\~<br>
Sorry, it seems like I freaked everyone out<br>
When my store got blown up, I just so happened to be crushed underneath all those cases of Yamameto<br>
Those nasty drinks ended up absorbing most of the impact for me, which kept lil' ol' me alive (Turns out I did the right thing ordering so much of that damn stuff!?)

The Yamameto explosion caused me to look as if I was covered in flesh and blood<br>
Maybe that's why I wasn't discovered by other drones? (Scratches head)

All in all<br>
Although there is still tons of stuff I need to sort out<br>
(Things that were reduced to ash not included, so it might be a lot easier than I thought)<br>
This post is more or less to report my safety to everyone<br>
Hope that other injured folks can hang in there and make it as well<br>
JOE out (Mic drop)

1. The new personal information trojan horse virus' affected range includes all connection devices before V11 (In theory, because I don't have devices before V5 with me. However, nobody should be using those XD)

2. The more they fix iM, the crappier it gets. However, the development team has announced the update plans for next season. Can look forward to it.

3. A random hacker group has stated that several major producers of connection devices and equipment have been infiltrated by scammers. In the future, there's a possibility that brand\-new connection devices will have virus programs built into them.

4. Some forum blocks have claimed that Mono's music platform has already been cracked; still unproven. There is a chance that this is true, but Mono has ways to stop this. For example, once they detect a user of the cracked version, they can immediately lock on to the user and inform the admins of their position. This action is totally legal in the current regulations of the Administration Bureau. Thus, I still advise everyone to not attempt this kind of stuff.

5. Perhaps not too many people have taken notice of this, but the cyTus main system hasn't been updated for quite a while now (People don't normally read this it's just my personal interest lololol). The internal version has been stuck at V24, which is rather confusing. A while ago, a list of updates for V25 were leaked by an insider. I was a little bit excited about it. Despite that, there hasn't been any action for such a long time. Anybody knows what's going on???

This is a sad news, but we have to let everybody know. Last week, our band's lead vocalist Cherry, real name Sherry Pauline, has left us due to an accident.

We're still in shock and disbelief regarding this sudden tragedy. She is so considerate, so kind, and so talented. Our thoughts and prayers are with her family and friends, as well as all of you who loved her.

Cherry PuNK the band was born because of Cherry. She's the one who gathered us to realize our dreams of playing music together. We three have decided to suspend any band activities indefinitely. We would like everybody to give us some time to heal and collect ourselves.

Last but not least,<br>
For Cherry

You will always be in our hearts

\[News\]\[Cherry PuNK\]\[Sherry Pauline\]\[Obituary\]<br>
> Cherry (real name Sherry Pauline), the lead vocalist of popular band Cherry PuNK,  has passed away. The news has fans and the public in utter shock. Cherry's agency, Monophonic Entertainment, has confirmed this information earlier today. However, they remained silent regarding the cause of her death and other details. They only stated that they hope everyone can give the other band members and Cherry's family and friends some time to process this tragedy.<br>
> <br>
> On iM, thousands of posts were made to mourn her passing. Due to the very sudden nature of the incident, many fans stated that it's "Hard to accept.", "Really hope it's only a bad April Fools' joke." "Life comes at you fast." Multiple members of the entertainment industry also expressed their grief. Liam Gish, the head of Node 08's department of culture, stated, "My deepest condolences to her family and friends. The entertainment industry just lost a brilliant rising star. The things she put into her music and lyrics are not only the values and emotions of a young girl but also a microcosm of her attitude towards life."<br>
> <br>
> We would like to express our gratitude for everything Cherry gave us. May she rest in peace.

### Replies
**Gogossip**<br>
Question 1. The cause and the location of death are not stated clearly.<br>
Usually, the death of public figures should be accurately explained to the public.

Question 2. Xenon, who has a close relationship with Cherry, is still a fugitive on the run. <br>
Could he know something or, maybe this whole thing it's related to him in the first place?

**Gogossip**<br>
Question 3. The band's post said that it was an accident;<br>
however, if it's an accident in public, there should be news or a report of some kind. Is it an accident that cannot be divulged?

**888fans**<br>
It certainly is indeed a bit ambiguous...

The Nodes are so small, how can they let those missiles be flying back and forth?<br>
Even if they're suppressing the gangs,non\-lethal force is normally used first<br>
Why don't the admins simply decommission those drones?<br>
After they were hacked they just became even more useless.

Just in case\~<br>
What if the terrorists or gangs have greater firepower?

**NerfThat**<br>
They still need to consider the damage that might be caused to the city

**TrojanPony**<br>
Agreed<br>
If the TOWER is blows up<br>
half of the city would disappear...

**BUCK$**<br>
won't be easy to blow up the TOWER though...

**ElinaDaniel**<br>
Be careful. you guys might be blacklisted for dangerous speech w

**Snor_eDen**<br>
These incidents should make the admin bureau think hard about what's going on<br>
if they keep letting those heavy\-armed drones exist, <br>
who can keep that power under control?

**NoSignal**<br>
anyone who says we don't need force must not live in 03\~<br>
The technology gangs from 03 possess way more power than the admins wwww

**Mulder**<br>
The admins of 03 are just a faction of the gang, right?

**Mick_Rorty**<br>
don't matter if you prep<br>
Who knows what the hell will sneak in from the forbidden areas?

**Wrinkleheart**<br>
Heard rumors that the animals and plants in the forbidden areas do not have natural enemies at all.<br>
Just a bunch of terrifying creatures.

Dude, who the heck did you hear that from?

Recently I was told by some haters that I can't rock this game. That's total bull. I am a diehard fan of action puzzle\-solvers. I 've heard there's a streamer who nailed all the boss' without losing any HP. Tryin' to get the achievement where you make it to the end without dying once\~If you die even once you gotta restart the game!!!
