### I'm lost
**LIS**  
I'm lost... using Quadrants as address makes no sense. The Node is huge and it's only divided into four Quadrants. All roads are labeled by numbers. What kind of "Genius" invented this system??
### Replies

I heard that a long time ago every road has its own unique name. How can anyone remember their address like that?

MeowBot is completely broken. Panoramic camera crashed and now my home is covered with corrupted footage. I can't find the Bot nor can I find the door. SOS!

There is a service button in the settings page. BUT you have to find it first lol

Is it illegal to swap ID chips with someone else? How about one person owning multiple IDs that connects to cyTus?
### Replies

Not illegal in either case, but A.R.C. might ban your IDs if they find out.

### The limits of Artificial Intelligence
**KirinKiraKira**  
I know technology is quite developed right now. However, Artificial Intelligence is nowhere near the level of having a virtual girlfriend! WTF is A.R.C. doing?
### Replies
**Mohito**  
I thought it's a serious discussion based on the topic; turns out is buncha nonsense...

**KirinKiraKira**  
What are you talking about... did you realize that's the dream of countless single men? Don't act that you never thought of that you nerd\~

**Uctron_Rust**  
As of now, the peak of AI should be **@ROBO\_Head**, right? He can even create his own music

**ROBO_Head**  
All calculations this Unit has done, result of integrating data from internet. Does not qualify as "Intelligence"

**KirinKiraKira**  
Robo\_head is so strict...

**AliceinCytus**  
A.R.C.'s mechanical pets are already pretty amazing. They act almost exactly the same as real animals. A while ago my friend's MeowBot got ran over by a car; she cried so hard that I really believe it's an actual pet that died

### Replies

Thank goodness it's free, and we still got the opening performances of Robo\_head and PAFF

**Popo**  
I don't remember the opening acts too well, but it's NOT OK to make everyone wait in front of the main stage for two goddamn hours

**Jingleglimmer**  
How come what I've heard it's that there was a blackout?

**Rabbitdora**  
But didn't NEKO said that it just wasn't held at all? Is it really a blackout?

### Discomfort during connection
**Majaja**  
Recently when I connect to cyTus, I get this nauseating feeling. Doctors can't figure out what's wrong either. Should I file a complaint to A.R.C.?
### Replies
**Miyoko1212**  
My friend also has similar issues, problems with the chips?

**Jingleglimmer**  
Does the nausea just pop up randomly? or do they appear under certain circumstances?

**Majaja**  
Yes! It only occurs during virtual connections. Every time I get this Déjà vu feel, not sure if it's music I've heard or scenes I've seen. Then the nausea starts.

**RamenBot**  
Maybe you're a time traveler lol

**HC**  
Remember to drink chocolate milk to lessen the discomfort XDDD

**Majaja**  
What's with all the Sci\-Fi references...?

### I don't understand what A.R.C is doing
**Uctron_Rust**  
That Colin Neumann Jr. guy that A.R.C. just hired as an advisor, wasn't he arrested by the admins ten years ago for trespassing into the Ruins? Why would A.R.C. get someone with such a questionable resume?
### Replies
**Mecha_Giga**  
The fact is that the "trespassing into Ruins" thing only applies in Node08, hence the headlines back then. Other Nodes don't give a damn about people wandering into the Ruins. If you ask me, I think A.R.C. has more problems with all the shady stuff with the admins.

**Rabbitdora**  
I mean, the admins have no business dealing with stuff outside the Node area right lol

**RamenBot**  
Is his trespassing something to do with the hospital?

**SoundOfF**  
You can look into the news archives of this guy. For several years, all breakthroughs A.R.C. made happened because of him XD

**Juggernaut**  
You mean writing papers that utterly destroyed A.R.C.'s "research"? Hahaha.

**Mohito**  
He went missing for several years, recently he started a new account for music purposes I think

**Colinforever**  
Colin Sensei is a legend ok? He is not your typical run\-of\-the\-mill scholar

### iM UI
**Shibawu**  
iM's UI is getting worse with every "patch", especially the virtual connection interface, which is now a complete mess... my head hurts every time I use it
### Replies

Is it? I think it's pretty good, much better than the version couple of years ago

**TearFox**  
If you get virtual connection sickness then use the mobile or PC version

**Arayray**  
If you get dizzy than don't surf the net with chips lol

OMFG really fainting on stage lololol are we going the cheesy soap opera route now?
### Replies
**Smurky**  
Several audiences also fainted as well. A collaborated act?

**NEKOSAIKOU**  
Maybe the singing is so horrible that they rather faint lolololol

**beeeeeeeeee**  
I think it might be real this time. I mean what's the benefit of making such a fuss?

**NEKOSAIKOU**  
Are you dumb? They need this fuss to cover up their old news. Remember all that copyright controversy Mono is going through? Nobody's talking about it now with all this tragedy stuff taking over the headlines lololol

**Poopytrap**  
Hmmm you had a point there XD

**NEKOSAIKOU**  
**@NEKO\#ΦωΦ** has already seen through all this BS man she good LOLOL

### \[Repost\] Virtual area for concert has connection issues, hundreds affected
**STANley**  
> A few days ago, famous singer PAFF collapsed on stage during her annual concert. At the same time, audience members in the virtual area began to collapse as well. Several people in the physical area also displayed discomfort. In the hundreds of people affected by this issue, 11 have yet to regain their consciousness.   
>   
> An A.R.C. spokesperson stated today," We will begin the investigation of this incident as soon as possible. For the time being, we would like everyone to limit their use of virtual connections.

### Tips from Dr.Hawkins
**Dr. Hawkins**  
Although it's a bit weird to give this tip on iM, I would advise everyone to control their time using the internet.   
Recently, there has been a significant increase in patients who visit us due to discomfort caused by virtual connections. We have categorized them as victims of an internet addiction syndrome.  
No matter how advanced technology has become, using the virtual connection for a long period of time will still cause a certain level of stress to the brain. Please take good care of your body.
### Replies
**Y4NK**  
Agreed. Many of my friends are like that and their memory is getting worse

**NerfThat**  
I'm so scared that I'm keeping my surfing time to under 2 hours per session...

**RamenBot**  
What should we do if we are already affected??

**Dr. Hawkins**  
As of now, there is no complete cure for faltering in memory/balance and cognitive disorders. Patients with serious symptoms sometimes fall into a coma.

Just like the past, failure in eyesight due to overuse of electronic products is also incurable. Therefore before we discover a complete solution, I can only give tips like this to prevent these symptoms from happening in the first place.

**Pinevalley**  
Terrifying! Gotta get offline now\~

**Aceman**  
Thank you for the tip doctor. More people need to know about this

### A short trip
**Marshall**  
Just came back from a holiday, man finally feels alive again. You really need to leave your job completely to get actual rest... I attended a mental enhancing camp in another Node; it was a great experience.
### Replies
**RamenBot**  
Your application actually got granted?

**Wannacry**  
Last time I had to wait in line for an entire morning before it's finally my turn...

**AliceinCytus**  
I though cross\-Node traveling is the pain in the neck. Last time someone's application wasn't granted... they had to be deported from another Node and sent back QQ

**Marshall**  
It worked just fine for me though. Just remember to apply earlier, then wait for a short while. As long as you inform your company everything should be okay.

**CHanatsuka**  
It's a bit annoying, but an early application does indeed help.

**Y4NK**  
Maybe I should plan a trip too. I'm way too exhausted at work these days.

### Weird\-ass experience
**Mecha_Giga**  
This is a weird\-ass experience I heard from a friend's friend. He said that he fell asleep without removing the virtual connection cable. He had a dream where he's surfing the net and sending messages to friends. After he woke up, he found out that it wasn't just a dream; he actually sent out those messages in real life...
### Replies
**TunaLee**  
Didn't the manual for the chips say that you shouldn't sleep with the cable connected?

**RamenBot**  
Woah that's creepy. Never thought the "it's a dream so I can do whatever I want" scenario would actually exist OAO

**KiwaHu**  
You can send urban legend stuff to **@ROBO\_Head** XD

**ROBO_Head**

Maybe his child doesn't want to be in showbiz? Maybe she wanted to be a doctor?

### So memories can be deleted?
**Mohito**  
I was an audience at Æsir\-FEST. Before I don't remember seeing Æsir on stage when recalling this event. I get sick and my memory is blurry.  
After reading Robo\_head's post, I am very certain that Æsir did take the stage and perform that day. I'm also quite confident that this is my actual/correct memory.   
If this really is the doing of a hacker or virus, this means that memories can be deleted through virtual connection. Therefore I would advise everyone to stay away from it.

### It's just a dream, just a dream
**Dreamer**  
In my dream, the most influential organization in Node 08 actually contains some shady people that are stealing their recreated\-yet\-undeveloped tech to sell them for a huge profit. You know, dangerous things like Anti\-gravity tech\~ weapons of mass destruction\~ enhancement surgery\~ bioweapons...etc.
### Replies
**Dreamer**  
Think about it, what if Æsir\-FEST is also a part of their experiments? Maybe the admins already now, but still allow it to happen because of mysterious reasons?

**Dreamer**  
A.R.C.'s core principle is to maximize technology development. It sounds fine and dandy by saying that it's "for the sake of humanity", but in fact they may still want to control everything, right? The two\-to\-three\-hour memories of millions of people seem like an insignificant sacrifice under these ideals.

**Andy_Roid**  
This sounds way too much like a conspiracy theory. I mean, what benefit does this bring them?

**Dreamer**  
Maybe there's some super advanced tech that requires an experiment of this scale. Don't forget that before the virtual internet was developed, A.R.C. was nowhere near its current status of power

**MaxLCK**  
I have plenty of friends who work at A.R.C., I believe they won't do something like this

**Lynx87**  
**@Xenon** knock knock, come out and explain yourself\~\~\~

Æsir\-FEST was already an event where everyone has their own version of the story. Then Robohead came out and revealed that the event was held; it's just that everyone's memory of it was gone. But instead of clearing things up, it led to even more weird\-a\*\* speculations lol

**HolyEarth**

Anyone have the contact information of other people that work for Mono?

### About that Xenon
**Nyd_Ans**  
Aren't you working some sort of internet security\-related job at A.R.C.?  
Got anything?
### Replies
**Axroid_Sona**  
What related job? The entire virtual internet security system is basically his handiwork lul, well maybe there's a team who works with him

**ShadowForest**  
It seems like he's not willing to say too much about this

**DuskDawn**  
Hiding something?

**Doubty**  
Maybe he's the one behind it

**Brock3tt**  
Don't like him

**Irisa0938**  
He rarely talks about work on his account in the first place

**Copper_stone**  
Probably another one of A.R.C.'s pets; never expected much from him

**Arya_Poke**  
Rumor has it that he has a s\*\*\*\*\* personality, and his love life is a mess too

**AntiMetal**  
People in music bands are always like that, especially metal bands

**Gogossip**  
Got gossip?

**Cipher_troll**  
There were rumors about him dating NEKO a while ago, then recently someone saw him getting back together with his ex\-girlfriend Cherry

**Andy_Roid**  
Cherry? Who's that?

**CyberLord**  
That Cherry PuNK girl right? The one that has been covering up for PAFF a lot these days

**Rob_Oto**  
Let's tag him XDDD Hey **@Xenon**\~\~\~\~\~ tell us about your gossip \~\~\~

**NoProblemo**  
You're gonna get reported if you keep tagging like this lol

### I find NEKO to be the biggest suspect
**AntiNEKO**  
Not that I want to single her out, but when her posts are regularly filled with extreme comments, it simply makes it very hard to believe that she's truly innocent
### Replies
**Manpora**  
But why would she hack her own audience?  
Isn't that shooting herself in the foot??

**RaiKiyumi**  
Finally resorting to stupid s\*\*\* for a publicity stunt I guess

**Poopytrap**  
Stop talking trash about NEKO!!!  
The investigation is still ongoing!!!

**Miyoko1212**  
It's pretty much GG when the admins come after your a\*\* though

**KirinKiraKira**  
Not really, it's only for investigation, right?

**Trashtalker**

I remember that I attended the launch celebration party, but have no memories of what actually happened. I woke up today on my bed still wearing my suit
### Replies

Did you really not remember anything lul? Maybe you've been Æsir\-ed XDD

**lenba**  
I somewhat recalled that I talked a lot of nonsense?  
Oh god, I hope that I didn't say anything TOO offensive?

**Hulujam**  
I think you're ok. Your colleague from Node14 took that cake for "most WTF" last night XD

**STANley**  
You mean **@Kemcoter** ?? LOLOLOL

**Marshall**  
Was he really THAT drunk XDD

**beeeeeeeeee**  
Dude he was TRASHED!! He had absolutely no memories of what happened XDDDD

**NathaN**  
He went completely nuts and started slurring his native language nonstop. Oh and he ate bananas with his bare hands

**RamenBot**  
Wait, what bananas??

**lrrllrrl**  
He peeled the entire banana (like the whole thing) and grabbed it with his bare hands then started swinging it around like he's Donkey Kong on crack. I... I can't...

**TunaLee**  
**@lenba** you were super cute yesterday though

**maplewing**  
Wanna see a recording XDDD

**lenba**  
U...ummm I'll pass on that XD

**Rabbitdora**  
Should we hold another party the next time we have a product launch?

**C.Y.**  
Sure

**Kemcoter**  
I woke up in the middle of the night yesterday only to find myself sleeping on the lobby floor. Why did nobody wake me up!!!

**moonin**  
Because after you got drunk, you were running around like a madman and literally sticking your face to other people's faces when they were trying to talk to you!!!

**KiwaHu**  
**@Kemcoter** so that was you. I was wondering why there's a weird noise outside, hence why I never left my office.

**JAC-jack**  
Goddamnit I was not there f\*\*\*\*\*\* \~\~\~\~ looks like I missed a lot of good s\*\*\*!!

**CHanatsuka**  
No worries man. We'll hold another one when the next version launches!!

### More of this BS and I'm going to Mono for some actual answers
**An0nym0us**  
Haven't been this disappointed in a company for a while  
Can't even tell us the whereabouts of their own artist  
Cancel events to avoid giving any explanation  
Put in some random rookie and dismiss their fans like that?  
Let's go and show them what the internet can do

Yeah let's go. I'm gonna go even if it means I take a day off. Man, I'm soooo p\*\*\*ed off (\-\_\-\#)

**Mecha_Giga**  
Dude you're gonna get preventive detention  
Recently the admins have been keeping a keen eye on iM  
Even NEKO's account was blocked previously

**Flower_Head**  
Nah that's impossible. Freedom of speech is basic stuff. It's definitely a guaranteed right

**TobeTobe**  
If someone can see all your personal messages in secret yet does nothing and say nothing about it, does this still counts as freedom of speech?

**T3RA_wr47h**

Can't help it. Most people can't use their brains properly

They'll spit nonsense like "Who cares my idol's missing, I want mental compensation Boo Hoo" or some BS like that (?

**C.Y.**  
These days, reasonable comments get buried by the mob...

**MYMYM**  
Also that MonoWillPay tag makes it seem like it's really Mono's wrongdoing when clearly it's not

**KiwaHu**  
If they are actual fans, shouldn't help finding PAFF be the more urgent thing to do?

**JAC-jack**  
Which shows that a lot of the people in this commotion don't actually care about her; they just wanted to use this chance to cause trouble

**RamenBot**

Our demands are based on evidence and good reasons. Today, if the Administration Bureau demands us to leave, then we should have the right to demand an apology and mental compensation from Monophonic Entertainment. We devoted our time and money to PAFF, yet we get treated like garbage by the agency. Is that even fair????

About that Cherry, she rode PAFF's coattails to fame anymore. that b\*\*\*\* had it coming!!

**SancTityKnight**  
The agency has dispatched people to find her

A ton of fans should be looking for her too  
Yet as of now, we still have absolutely no clue at all??  
Don't you find that to be very odd?
### Replies
**Figuring_0UT**  
I also find this to be really odd  
I mean, this is Node 08 after all  
All this advanced surveillance system and stuff, yet still nothing at all?

**Ararar**  
If she has a certain level of camouflage technology then maybe it would be hard to find her (?

**Ange3Lina**  
Dude, this is PAFF we are talking about, not ConneR

**ElinaDaniel**  
If it's ConneR sensei, I feel like he would just knock out every single person who's trying to track him down LOL

**BuddyHat**  
Robohead did mention that it would be harder to track her down if it's the suburb area

**BabyHug**  
If it's a kidnapping, news about a ransom should appear a long time ago. Could it be that Mono is still hiding something?

**iluvpuf**  
At the very least, I hope it's not something terrible QAQ  
PAFF, come back\~\~\~\~

**Heart_Head**  
Perhaps she took the Xenon route and covered her face with a helmet (?

**m00nl16h7**

I have a friend who is a hardcore fan... He's the one who dragged me here, and now we can't leave...

Can you stream to give everyone a peak of the site??

No, thanks. I don't think the atmosphere here is suitable for that \~"\~

### Feeling p\*\*\*ed after seeing NEKO's stream
**JusticeMe**  
The entertainment industry and the record labels are shady\-AF  
Treating artists like products  
Right now, we have no idea what the heck they are up to  
They better give us an explanation ASAP

**MAN_Dora**  
If it's really all a set\-up then hot dang is this business shady. PAFF is a living human being, not an item

**CandiceNaoko**  
Take NEKO's word with a grain of salt though  
Since she has quite the personal vendetta against the company when she left, her comments tend to be more extreme

**Chevalier151**  
There is indeed a group of people on\-site who are there because of NEKO's stream. They feel the need to teach this company a lesson  
**\#MonoWillPay**

**koolboss01**  
And yet they ended up targeting the wrong person LOL  
All they did was getting an innocent injured. EPIC FAIL

**NotScalper**  
I say that the protest is somewhat of a success?? I mean, they should feel the pressure now, I think??

**Srys_lee**  
Maybe PAFF has a part in this mess too?

**PaffCheckin**  
No comment on this. Had a feeling that nothing good ever happens when Mono is involved

Dude, WTH?

**Talus_Alpha**  
Didn't a bunch of gang members got arrested just a few days ago? Also, from what I can tell, those in the crowd appears to be just net users and/or fans

**Arkman**  
To be fair, I saw the call on a forum and thought I could maybe get some quick cash out of this. That's the only reason I'm here...

**DDStream**  
Gotcha\~\~\~\~\~\~ It's people like you who add fuel to the fire! (TBH, compare to those actually wrecking stuff, folks like you seems to be minor offenders)

**HandsomeYi**  
Looks like a lot of people got riled up by NEKO's stream and forgot about common sense

**Arkman**  
I wanna go home...  
After seeing Cherry get injured, I start to feel like I wasn't in the right mind when I decided to come here...

**Uxi**  
Can you actually come out though?? Heard that the admins are ready to start using moderate removal methods

**Michiko**  
It's way too difficult to garner the support of public opinion when your protest is targeted at a private business  
Not to mention that they even assaulted an innocent person, not a good look

### Can this Mono s\*\*\* fiesta end already?
**MustangMartin**  
At first, we just want Mono to find the missing person and properly handle the aftermath of this incident  
But when I went there, completely different story. The entire site is utterly out of control with no clear goal.The original purpose of the protest is all but lost...
### Replies

**HC**  
Moreover, what she said was probably exaggerated Her dissatisfaction towards Mono is well documented

**SYY**  
BTW, didn't NEKO just got back from the admins due to the Æsir incident? Is it ok for her to start spewing nonsense like this so soon LMFAO lolololol

**BUCK$**

**ShadowForest**  
One can say that Cherry was indirectly screwed by NEKO…

I personally feel like it's time we end this  
but it seems like a lot of folks on\-site don't agree with me…

**Justin888**  
Things can get really ugly if this continues…

**NoProblemo**  
Imo, Mono is really patient about this already   
If it's the admins, they might want to deal with this in the most efficient way possible

### This time we will definitely make them feel our rage
**Fuxkoff**  
Mono probably thinks that this is none of their business anymore, don't they? They see that they can't handle the situation, so they terminate the contract and abandon her. They think we are stupid enough to let them off scot\-free with no responsibility after turning the entire situation to s\*\*\* 

If that's their attitude, we are not stopping at just surrounding the building this time. I'll be on my way first. You guys can follow up later

### New behind the scenes update on Xenon's love triangle!NEKO\#ΦωΦ? Cherry?
**Vicky**  
A few days ago, popular streamer NEKO\#ΦωΦ, who was acquitted of all charges for her involvement in the infamous hacking incident, has returned to her home. Previously, this paper caught sight of one\-man band leader Xenon and CherryPuNK lead vocalist Cherry accompanying her as she left the Bureau. Today, there has been a new update to the situation. 

Yesterday afternoon, Xenon left his home alone. After cautiously looking around, he rode his motorcycle directly to a civilian household on 07 street in Quadrant II. That household turned out to be NEKO's home. According to photos taken by our reporter on\-site, Xenon was welcomed into the house by NEKO's family and went directly to her room. For around 20 minutes, the two stayed in her room, alone. The lights were turned off, making it impossible for us to determine what they were up to. As sunset approached, Xenon did not stay for dinner. After a quick chat with NEKO at the doorway, he left on his motorcycle. 

The other female in this love triangle, Cherry, was accidentally injured during the recent protests in front of Mono HQ. At the time of this visit, she was resting in the hospital. Xenon chose not to visit her at the time; instead, he chose to visit NEKO at her home. Does this mean that he finally made his decision? Or is he still wandering between the two and playing his dangerous game of love? For more behind\-the\-scenes information on this case, please follow 08 Daily. We will continue providing updates on the situation.

### Maybe we were all too impulsive
**HandsomeYi**  
I was there on\-site for all of the previous riots. I was indeed quite p\*\*\*ed off at first. When the admins started interfering, I was also furious because I don't know why they were helping Mono with their shady businesses. However, I do feel like we were the ones to blame for injuring an innocent artist too. We can't just pretend that everything is Mono's fault.

I know that I might get a lot of hate for this, but we should all calm down and think about this carefully imho

There's no denying that Mono did a crappy job handling this  
However, there are things (PAFF's self\-disappearance included) that are not entirely their fault

I've been wanting to say this for a long time, that there's something seriously not right about this  
But even my friends were really mad towards Mono on this

### Requesting witness information regarding PAFF's whereabouts
**PaffCheckin**  
Hello everyone,  
Like all of you, I am a PUFFER. I love PAFF and her singing as much as every one of you; and just like all of you, I am also very concerned about her since her disappearance

Even though the law enforcement agents are already searching for her, I still want to contribute to the cause, however minor it may be. Several friends and I created a website in hopes that we could gather all possible witnesses available online regarding PAFF's whereabouts. We will sort through the information and send teams to investigate if we determine the tip to be credible. If you want to participate as well, please visit the following website for more details on this operation. Come and help us find our beloved PAFF.

### iM has been really laggy lately
**Brainmania**  
Sometimes the connection just suddenly gets really slow makes me wonder if I unintentionally connected to another Node's internet
### Replies
**Brainmania**  
Ah also sometimes when I'm reading articles I get garbled text it's so annoying Is it because my connection device is too dated or is it because the signal interferrence at my work place is too severe

**TunaLee**  
Your lack of punctuation is equally annoying to me

**KiwaHu**  
Everything seems fine for me though. The speed is quite fast too. Looks like it's an equipment issue

**Brainmania**  
Which equipment is it the chips or the connection cable I'll replace it right away

**KiwaHu**  
Your brain

**Brainmania**

**Curo**

TBH, I experienced that sometimes as well. Maybe the cyTus system is under going maintenance

### So those drones can actually shoot water streams
**Marshall**  
I only know about this due to the news report on the recent riots. From what I recall, drones are also technology that has not been fully recreated, yet we can already modify them?

**AvaJaKeLon**  
My friend's uncle works at the Administration Bureau. He told me that that it's fine to do minor modifications. However, there are indeed still a lot of things they don't understand about the drones.

**AvaJaKeLon**  
He also showed me this catalogue. Excluding the earlier models that caused accidents in the past, there are still seven or eight models of drones that are in service right now. Each model has its own specific purpose. Too bad I don't remember any of them

**ARCist**  
Yikes can you actually show that kind of info to people

**AvaJaKeLon**  
... Maybe it's better for me to stop talking XD

**TrojanPony**  
Come on tell us more  
That way, we will know how to counter them when they are trying to suppress us in the future

**Mulder**  
Does this count as inapporpriate speech XD

**SYY**  
Well, can't help it then. I shall activate my spell card to special summon the Super Encyclopedia  
**@ROBO\_Head** Any information regarding the drones?

**Snor_eDen**  
We've been continually monitoring the connection quality over here. Recently, the connection is indeed a bit unstable. The record shows that there were several sudden disconnects and login issues. We hope ARC can address these issues as soon as possible.

### \[Announcement\] Congratulations to ROBO\_Radio\_LIVE for the successful concert
**Mono_official**  
To our dear fans and precious customers,

First of all, Monophonic Entertainment would like to congratulate the recently concluded ROBO\_Radio\_LIVE for its overwhelming success. To allow people who love music to all come together and share the emotions is also one of the main goals of Monophonic Entertainment when it was established. 

For the past few days, we've also received a lot of messages from the media and fans about the current contract situation between Cherry PuNK and Monophonic. We will use this opportunity to explain that here as well.

Cherry PuNK's lead vocalist Cherry is still under contract with Monophonic Entertainment, who acts as her album publishing firm as well as her performance agency. The incident this time, where an artist accepted a performance invitation in private, gave us a direct experience of how much the fans adore Cherry. However, we also want to devote all of Monophonic's resources to every single Cherry PuNK performance to make the event even more incredible than it already was. We want our fans to experience the ultimate feast to the eyes and ears. Therefore, the entire Monophonic staff was slightly disappointed when we couldn't participate in ROBO\_Radio\_LIVE together with Cherry. 

Monophonic Entertainment will not pursue legal actions regarding this incident. We also promise everyone that we will continue to improve ourselves so we can create even better spaces for performing and composing. Please continue to follow and support us. Thank you.

Monophonic Entertainment  
Entire staff

After all, if they really wanted to pursue the case, it would be tough for Cherry to not be in the wrong

**Cherry0987**  
Although Cherry violated her contract first, her performance on ROBO\_Radio\_LIVE kicked so much a\*\*!!  
It was a treat to see her there\~\~

### Æsir\-FEST event, 08 Daily exclusive report series Part 4
**Vicky**  
Discover the secrets, painstaking investigation: Æsir\-FEST event report series Part 4

After reading parts 1 \~ 3 of our in\-depth coverage reports, we believe that everyone now has a better understanding regarding the ins and outs of the entire  Æsir\-FEST incident.  
In this report, 08 Daily will be shifting the focus from the mysterious Æsir to another person who's deeply connected with this incident. If you are a loyal reader of our magazine, our follow\-up report regarding the hacking incident of the streamer NEKO should still ring a bell. That's right! The focus of today's report has multiple key identities, including back\-end system administrator of A.R.C., rumored current boyfriend of NEKO and Ex\-boyfriend of Cherry PuNK main vocalist Cherry, Xenon (Real name: Simon Jackson). 

"The mysterious renegade! The legendary hacker "X", who robs the rich and gives to the poor! An underground punisher that lurks in the shadows of the internet!" It's safe to assume that readers who are born in the 680s are all quite familiar with this urban legend that was all the rage on the traditional internet. Not long after "X" disappeared from the internet, his real identity was quickly exposed to be the then 15 year\-old\-only Simon Jackson! Even though Simon, who was already starting to focus on composing music, never openly acknowledged this secret identity back from his years as a student, that didn't stop him from garnering a massive following and popularity on the internet. After he joined the underground band Crystal PuNK, it also took the music world by storm in what seems like the blink of an eye.

Despite his achievements in music, Xenon never abandoned his talents in computer technology. As a high school dropout, he was able to return to school and graduated. Not long after his graduation, he joined A.R.C.'s internet security department and participated in the establishment of many of the current internet security protocols and regulations. Why did A.R.C., an organization that was quite notorious for their attention to their applicants' educational background, allow Xenon, a former high school dropout, to join such a crucial department? It's impossible to not be suspicious of such a decision.

According to the information leaked to our news center by an insider, Xenon's role and administrative power in A.R.C. are much more complicated than what they announced to the public. He is not your average system administrator. He is someone who has unrestricted access to any block and is practically a god to the internet. In addition, as someone who is very familiar with all the regulations and protocols, he can also easily bypass any encrypted... (Read more)

### Did you guys see that news report about Xenon???
**Krypton**  
I feel like the tone of 08 Daily's reports is a bit biased. Like from the beginning, the reporter's attitude is always one where she's trying hard to dig up some dirt about X, or at least it seems that way.  
Like, it's very noticeable in her previous report about picking up NEKO from the Bureau too. I don't think a reporter should have a presumption like that, or is that just me??  
Although I am a bit surprised by the things Xenon did as a teenager, isn't that pretty cool as well?  
It's like a superhero saving the world! Something every regular civilian (me included) would love to do!

### Stop speaking up for that POS
**BlackNicholas**  
Isn't Xenon the most suspicious one ever since this whole incident started???  
This issue of 08 Daily stated that too  
He's a computer genius who started to display his talents at a very young age  
He personally established many security regulations and protocols after he joined A.R.C.  
During Æsir\-FEST he was allegedly (according to himself) monitoring the internet back\-end at A.R.C.  
He knows NEKO very well so it shouldn't be difficult at all for him to hack into her stream  
Every single case that he's involved in so far have become unsolved mysteries  
The answers don't get more obvious than that, right?  
These days on iM the issues of random garbled text and deleted comments have also been increasing  
Could it be that these are side effects of him tampering with the virtual internet in the past??

F\*\*\*! Can't stand those idiots who are speaking up for him

I don't doubt that Xenon may be capable of doing this  
But what about his motives??

Perhaps his motive is that he wants to get girls (and he succeeded in getting two goddesses, f\*\*\* I'm so jealous)

### ARC needs to give us a proper explanation
**9tingale**  
I was really angry that all we get is a template announcement about the system being fixed

I'm a registered nurse at hospital 15  
In this day and age, most medical systems are connected to the cyTus system  
There is a central system that universally oversees everything on each floor  
When the whole system broke down this time, it was a manpower shortage catastrophe for the entire hospital  
Not to mention the many patients on the intensive care floors who relied on life support systems just to stay alive  
All of them gone in a snap of the finger. We didn't even have time to save them

I realize that this was a very serious accident  
However, the cyTus system is already this crucial to human society  
Shouldn't ARC shoulder a bit more social responsibility?

At the very least, we have the right to know more secrets, right?
### Replies
**Popo**  
Agreed. My company was also in a huge mess due to the situation this time. They should come out and give us a proper explanation

**Neon_raven**  
I feel like ARC has already done well enough for us  
Without the ancient technology they excavated, we're probably still drilling wood for fire  
Everybody is so strict

**Prime6750911**  
Not like we want to be strict, but this is human lives we're talking about!!

**Talus_Alpha**  
Our world is already deeply rooted in ARC's systems. Without it, we couldn't even survive.  
Nevertheless, it is a bit scary if this keeps happening. We are relying on it so much yet issues still occur on a regular basis...

**Wickedragon**  
Ask not what ARC can tell you  
Ask what you can do for ARC

**vveay**  
Get out. This is a serious discussion and not a place for you to talk s\*\*\*

**Andy_Roid**  
If we think about it carefully, every single human in Node 08 is a user of ARC  
I don't think it's too much to ask for a bit of security promise

**HandsomeYi**  
These ungrateful a\-holes asking for so much, who would want to be a hero if this is what they get?  
I support ARC.  Ignore these stupid haters

**AntiMetal**  
LOLOL Isn't the most famous hero within ARC a super hacker in the past? Legal criminal we're talking here

**UltraKY**  
When I see the previous comment, can't help but have a dream. No need to wait too long. A big announcement is coming soon. Everybody is going to be so shocked

Ah, I woke up. Better watch the news

**in9odwetrust**  
Same here, waiting for answers

**Snor_eDen**  
I'm a random engineer who happens to pass by. I've been chasing the recent internet issues for some time now. I am certain that this is definitely not some accident by chance. Instead, someone is purposely manipulating the system

**CHanatsuka**  
Don't stop halfway through. It's making me anxious

**Snor_eDen**  
Does everyone still remember the performance hosted by ROBO\_Head a while ago? During that event, there were a lot of ghost connections eating up the data flow which completely ruined the live stream's quality. I've been investigating this stuff since that event. I discovered that a lot of the encrypted addresses share similar characteristics. Therefore, I can make a reasonable speculation that this is the act of one person or one organization.

**Snor_eDen**  
In addition, the recent garbled text and blank comments, the massive malfunction in the past few days, I also found that some of the interference came from the same encrypted address I mentioned above. I believe you guys understand where I'm going with this

**Kemcoter**  
Dude what you said was terrifying AF. So there really was a powerful mastermind behind all this?  
But, only some sort of super hacker is capable of doing such a thing, right??

**66TAN66**  
Engineer passing by, please save us!!

**Krypton**  
Wait, this is looking like a case where the admins need to interfere. **@Snor\_eDen** Should we report it

**Mick_Rorty**  
I personally feel that the admins don't have the ability to handle cybercrime... Our only hope is probably ARC

### \[Breaking\] A.R.C. backend system administrator Simon Jackson taken into custody by the Administration Bureau as prime suspect of recent incidents
**ROBO_Head**  
\[News\]\[Æsir\]\[Hacker\]\[ICybercrime\]\[A.R.C.\]\[Administration Bureau\]  
> We have received the latest news. Just earlier today, A.R.C. backend administrator Simon Jackson has been arrested in A.R.C. by law enforcement agents. Our sources show that he is none other than the biggest suspect for "Æsir", the mastermind behind the recent string of internet crime incidents.   
>   
> According to our inside sources, the Administration Bureau received investigative information from an A.R.C. employee. The employee accused Simon Jackson of using a specialized A.I. that has yet to clear safety protocols for all kinds of operations. The Administration Bureau decided to delve further into the situation. However, when they came across A.R.C.'s system program records, they discovered a large number of commands used by said A.I. to commit internet crimes, which even includes the infamous cyberterrorism incident during a live stream a few months ago. All this evidence are proof of Simon Jackson's highly possible association with Æsir.   
>   
> Faced with such serious accusations, Simon Jackson did not say a single word to defend himself, nor attempted to prove his innocence. Instead, he appeared at the Bureau with law enforcement agents and has been very cooperative throughout the process. We are currently chasing this news in real\-time and will update you with the latest information at any time.

Then when Robohead exposed the truth months ago, he was like "Oh I'm figuring out a way to help everyone..." Dang that was some excellent acting, wasn't it???

### Any idea why such a winner in life would go and commit crimes??
**WeskerLam**  
Seriously, why?  
Genius, has a job that pays really well, knows how to play music, BOTH his rumored girlfriends are super hot/cute girls anyone would die to date  
It's not like he's a loser weeb like me who can only get a tiny sense of happiness through dating sims and simulation games  
Just... why the heck would he want to host a concert to delete everyone's memory?  
Is he a psychopath or what?
### Replies
**Go55ip**  
Maybe he has some sort of rare disease that allows him to achieve orgasm by deleting people's memories

**888fans**  
In addition, people won't even remember the ahegao you have when you delete their memories

**UltraKY**  
Ooh, how convenient

**GymGai**  
To get inspiration for songs? I have heard that some artists get their creative rush through negative emotions like violence and crimes. Maybe that's the case??

**Nyd_Ans**  
Goddamnit he is such a winner in life! I am jealous AF

**Marshall**  
Both NEKO and CHERRY are great!!! I often have... thoughts when I look at them

**DoToro**  
If you're someone who has followed Xenon from the very beginning,  
it's very difficult to imagine that he's someone who would do such things...

**Arya_Poke**  
Iirc, his motivations were not stated clearly in the news  
Usually, if someone pleads guilty directly without a motivation, something's definitely fishy, right

**DDStream**  
So... guilty was "pleaded" for him?  
Basically, a sacrificial lamb??

**4nonymous**  
Isn't it precisely because he's a winner in life that gave him the idea that he can get away with whatever bullcrap he does?

**aidan**  
Most winners in life ended up being complete f\*\*\* ups too  
You will treasure the things you have only if you achieved them through your own hard work!!

**HimawariK**  
I am proud to say that I've cleared all the routes for any dating sim I play!!  
**\#Weebpower**

**Heart_Head**  
The world of a genius is hard to understand. Perhaps there really is a reason that none of us ever thought about!

**NEKOSAIKOU**  
Welp, can't help it then, guess I'll be the one to comfort NEKO

**AlwaysKY**  
Maybe he lost in truth or dare?

**DogBark**  
Imo, there is definitely still more shady stuff that folks are not saying

### \[Repost\] Breaking! Cherry booed for being "unprofessional" after late arrival at concert, this person spoke up for her behind the scenes...
**Flower_Head**  
\[Entertainment\]\[Cherry PuNK\]\[Concert\]  
> In a recent performance of the popular band Cherry PuNK, lead vocalist Cherry appeared to suffer some serious mismanagement regarding her personal schedule. She was absent for almost 30 minutes before hastily taking the stage to complete the performance. Although her performance is still up to her usual standards, her actions at the start left quite the bad taste. Many audience members criticized her, calling this "The most absurd concert" they've ever seen.   
>   
> Cherry's late arrival occurred at a charity concert held at Node 08's Central Park. Many audience members actually waited in line overnight just to catch a glimpse of their idol, yet they were slapped with a near\-30 minute no\-show. Many thought that this was an organized warmup event by the band at first, which led to plenty of complaints. Some fans took to iM to express that Cherry is nowhere near as nice and professional as others have described. Their reasoning is that she didn't even bother to explain why she was late. She just hopped on stage and performed till the end as if nothing has happened.   
>   
> However, the day following the concert, fan club president CherryMyLife (iM account name) made a statement after contacting Cherry's agent and other band members to understand the situation. He stated that the real reason behind the delay was because Cherry had to deal with a family emergency that suddenly came up. Knowing how disappointed the fans would be of her absence, Cherry rushed to Central Park as fast as she could once she finished addressing the emergency.  
>   
> Cherry didn't cancel her performance even in the face of an unforeseeable situation. After this information surfaced, her dedication and work ethic immediately received praise from fans and netizens once again, claiming that Cherry is indeed "Node 08 rock's last hope". Praises like "Cherry is the best person I've ever seen.", "We don't deserve Cherry PuNK.", "This is why I will always love her." "Only Cherry can surpass Cherry" can be seen everywhere.

Cherry is what we call a true professional ok\~  
If it's other artists, they would've probably just canceled the whole thing!

**TunaLee**  
Does anyone else feel disgusted by this hollow content farm nonsense we're getting a lot these days??

**moonin**  
Her loyal fans probably didn't mind the delay, but the average audience would be pretty mad, right??

**vveay**  
Looks like mono's inner management has loads of issues too  
Why would anyone allow such a serious mishap??

**CJW**  
However, if we were to judge by previous cases, it seems like Mono can't really monitor Cherry either LOLOL  
Like the previous incident where she violated her contract, the whole thing barely even made the news

**HC**  
Is this what news are nowadays?? Just a compilation of internet comments??

**NnNn**  
Oh... so this counts as a report?

**JusticeMe**  
Those comments in the end... just how big of a fanboy do you have to be to make such stupid comments? Guess it takes talent to be a fanboy too ROFL

**lrrllrrl**  
WTF she just showed up at the end. What did she do to deserve such glowing praise?? Are we that desperate for anything good now?

I was literally dumbfounded that day. I really thought that LUMY's gonna perform the whole thing herself

**FindCherry**

### English pronunciation very important
**t×pazolite**  
Because my english is poor sometimes I use wrong pronunciation. A while ago when I performed at Node 47, a staff member asked me in English if I am ready or not. I wanted to say "I'm ready" but I said "I'm lady". I'm not lady.

**TunaLee**  
Hey, Node 47; heard there's a really amazing game company there XDDD

**C.Y.**  
Does 47 speaks English as well??  
I've always wanted to visit that place at least once

**JAC-jack**  
That's just because English is the most universal of all existing languages  
It's what the Academy taught us  
Doesn't really matter to me. It's not like English is hard or anything; anyone can learn it without trying

**Curo**  
Sir, do you have any idea how many people you just p\*\*\*ed off with that last line?

### Did any one of you suffer damages in this malfunction incident?
**9tingale**  
Our hospital got hit really hard in this incident  
It's like we drew the short straw on every single occasion  
Any device that requires connection got wiped out pretty much entirely  
Many patients in intensive care or has special diseases, unfortunately, passed away because of this   
(Surprisingly, there were also some patients whose symptoms got better)  
Just suddenly realize how severe the risks can be when we are so overly reliant on a singular system  
ARC did send someone later to discuss compensation with the higher\-ups of the hospital  
However, it all just felt too late...
### Replies

Even though you should already feel numb to life and death since you're in a hospital, stuff like this still makes me very upset

**in9odwetrust**  
Good work to all the doctors

**AaA**  
Thank you to all the doctors who held their posts in such a time of crisis

**BbB**  
Are there any ways we can give donations to the victims' families??

**Tracix**  
Wait, so no backup system at all for such delicate equipment?? QAQ

**Andy_Roid**  
ARC had better shell out some serious money for this screw\-up

**StuffyMouth**  
So there were people who got better??

**9tingale**  
Yes, patients with Virtual\-Internet Related Post\-Traumatic Stress Disorder

**Wickedragon**  
9tingale, have you ever thought about becoming a knowledge\-type streamer?  
I've always found your articles to be professional and useful

**Mimosa_droid**  
You can call yourself Miss Doctor or something

**Neon_raven**  
There are so many things wrong with that I won't even bother to correct you  
Dr. 9tingale would be a much better title

**IronFan**  
I support that\~\~\~\~\~\~

**kou**  
A prayer to all those who passed away \*Pray\*. May they all rest in peace

**Arayray**  
Back then when the internet broke down, I thought to myself "OH, crap." Nowadays, so many services and systems are deeply tied to the internet. It's guaranteed chaos if anything happens to it. And what do we know?

**Henry**  
All my bank services also got completely wiped out that day\~\~\~\~  
The money I transferred is still lost in the void

**Snor_eDen**  
If anyone needs help. feel free to contact me. I'll see what I can do.

**UltraKY**  
I feel like there's absolutely a loophole in the user agreement  
No way in hell would they ever compensate the whole amount!!!  
**\#ARCWillPay**

**Gogossip**  
By "getting better", do you mean that they woke from their coma??

**9tingale**  
Their brainwaves have returned to normal intervals  
But the reason why we noticed this is that there actually were patients who regained their consciousness  
It's a bit like they suddenly woke up from a deep sleep  
However, it's only for that brief time period, so we can't really call this a cure

**Krypton**  
If that's the case, maybe you should inform ARC about this too

**Henry**  
Maybe not now, as I bet they are currently in complete chaos trying to handle all the compensation and insurance stuff

### \[Repost\] Æsir\-FEST incident prime suspect Simon Jackson pleads guilty to his crimes
**Flower_Head**  
\[News\]\[Æsir\]\[Hacker\]\[Cybercrime\]\[A.R.C.\]\[Administration Bureau\]  
> The series of internet terrorist attacks related to the infamous Æsir\-FEST has been the talk of the Node. Prime suspect Simon Jackson (Internet ID: Xenon) was arrested a few days ago. Despite refusing to explain his involvement with the cases at first, after several nights of interrogation, we've received information that he has finally given up and pleaded guilty, stating that he is indeed the mastermind behind everything: Æsir.  
>   
> According to an anonymous source from within the Administration Bureau, Simon Jackson stated during interrogation: " Under a condition where a certain purpose exists in the subconscious, I may have used my computer technology skills to convert the theoretical thought of stealing memories into practical actions. Even though my memory is still in a rather chaotic state, I will not rule out the possibility that I fabricated this Æsir identity and used it to commit criminal acts."  
>   
> The source also points out that the higher\-ups at A.R.C., where Simon Jackson is previously employed at, have also dispatched key figures to assist the Administration Bureau in acquiring more evidence. This is also to ensure that there are no hidden accomplices or other potentially dangerous factors that may lead to another incident.

Is it possible that he's forced to plead guilty

Is it just me, or does this feel like the admins are in a hurry to get this case over with?? It all seems too easy

Heard that this game is seriously godlike  
Has already sweep through countless awards  
From the trailer, the combat system looks a bit complicated  
If I suck balls in tonight's session, please don't flame me

As with why I decided to stream all of a sudden  
Maybe because after watching NEKO stream for so long, it really seems like a fun thing to do  
So I decided to give it a try myself too

There's also the Mega Briefcase deluxe edition

The obvious way to go is to get him out, then make him repay that favor by working his a\*\* off for you. That's how you squeeze out all the value!

**Wrinkleheart**  
Locked up for life feels too harsh...  
I don't think this is a crime that deserves that severe of a punishment

**in9odwetrust**  
You never know there were quite a few indirect deaths caused by the malfunction of the internet, gotta take that into account too

**WAW**  
Wait you mean the previous massive internet malfunction case is also related to Xenon???  
Or is that just your personal speculation?

**SIhama**  
Does nobody wants to add new options lol  
I've been thinking...  
Maybe someone will go and jailbreak him outta there?

**StuffyMouth**  
No f\*\*\*in way LOL  
The security in that place is super tight. One wrong step and you'll be riddled with bullets by the drones XD

**Watch_Burn**  
If you ask me, I say there are no more than 3 people in the entirety of Node 08 who are skilled enough to carry that plan out

**GemFeather**  
I bet he'll be declared non\-guilty and acquitted. The admins f\*\*\*ed up and arrested the wrong guy in the first place!

**Manpora**  
I'm a fanboy of Xenon, so my bet is on C!  
That place is no match for the best hacker in the entire world!!!

**RamenBot**  
One vote for admin screw up  
I find it really difficult to trust anything the admins put out

**fotoistruth**  
ARC is so deeply connected with the admins, some sort of secret negotiation behind closed doors is totally possible, right?

**Prime6750911**  
He tainted my two goddesses, two life sentences

**UltraKY**  
The moral of this story: don't f\*\*\* with an angry weeb, or you'll get locked up for life. Ohhhh, so scary LMFAO

**Henry**  
I also feel like someone will bust him out  
Xenon should have a pretty wide web of connections

**Krypton**  
I feel like he also needs to first state clearly why he pleaded guilty. If not, why would anybody want to save him???

**FlyingCodo**  
Possibility of folks breaking him out to perform lynching (?

### Is it just me, or does someone else also feel like Æsir is a legendary performance artist?
**ShrimpBye**  
Æsir (I think it should be fair to directly call him Simon or Xenon now)  
is totally a legendary performance artist\~\~\~\~\~

When he debuted, he only distributed music on the internet for free: A rebellious attitude to the pop music industry that only cares about money

Invited famous artists to host a completely free Live performance: A symbol that music has no borders and should be accessible to everyone

At the end of the Live, erase everyone's memory and take it away: A sign that artists have absolute control over their own work

Hacking of an annoying streamer: A warning to ignorant brats. The world of the internet is not a place for you naive children to be messing around in

Real identity discovered: Everything turns out to be planned by the seemingly self\-righteous and self\-proclaimed "defender of justice" Xenon. A lesson that tells everyone to not trust shallow and egotistical truths so easily

You've successfully blurred the line between Xenon hater and fanboy cuz I have no idea which one you are after reading all this

**AAAnton**  
Is it just me, or has the letter X start to develop powers? Cuz every time I see it, I get this sense of nausea, dizziness and want to puke (faint

**RaiKiyumi**  
I feel like I have visual fatigue from seeing it so much  
I often have times where I suddenly don't know how to pronounce the letter "X"

**Lynx87**  
Keeping going, you are this close to persuading me

**Cipher_troll**  
There are so many damn loopholes in that. You can't just casually skip over everything like that without addressing the details. Context is important!

**noneXenon**  
If Xenon ever gets a bail, will everyone be willing to donate money to fund his bail?

**xxScarlexx**  
I'll donate I want to do something for him!!!!

**HolyEarth**  
Holy s\*\*\* This is the most amazing speculation I've seen since this incident occurred  
Can I repost it to my private chat group XDDDD

**Copper_stone**  
So... he performance\-arted himself to an arrest? Is he stupid or what  
Many of them pretty serious crimes too

**Fu7ureW0rld**  
I still believe that Xenon is innocent, something's definitely fishy about this case

**Logicker**  
Wait but Xenon did charge people money for his personal Live lol  
The logic makes no sense there, doesn't it???

**Pumpkinforest**  
He can dispute any illogical loopholes with that last point anyway. He is never wrong no matter what

**Muahaha**  
OP, have you ever consider starting a cult?  
You seem pretty good at BSing people

**Gearz_Igo**  
Hey look, it's friends who know how to talk nonsense\~\~\~

### Battle Royale game recommendation
**NnNn**  
Figure I'd pick up a battle royale game to give the genre a shot   
iM folks, recommendations plz!!!
### Replies
**CHanatsuka**  
Too many battle royales these days  
Do we have something that's more peaceful??

**TunaLee**  
For example, we can place a group of players in an area full of weapons  
If nobody dies within 30 minutes, all players are then declared winners  
Something like that???

**JAC-jack**  
What is this, an ultimate challenge to our humanity XDD I feel like it's definitely going to fail because there will never be a winner lol

**HandsomeYi**  
Tbh I don't think it's that bad of an idea. It would be quite the wake\-up call

**KiwaHu**  
Teammates: Hey, we got a gun here. Let's pick it up so players who want to hurt others won't get it.

**moonin**  
This is not battle royale anymore  
Should call it the peaceful royale

**vveay**  
If we go by human nature,  
there should be a group of people who consider themselves "righteous" and "fair". They will take away all the weapons first to "manage" them

**STANley**  
Then they will start attacking and downing those players that "feel" very dangerous to them

**SYY**  
In the end, in order to determine who is truly "dangerous", a conflict will break out and people will start bashing each other's brains in with the weapons

**lrrllrrl**  
Wait, then we're reverting back to an actual battle royale again WTH XDDDD

**Hulujam**  
Yes, this is human nature after all\~\~\~\~

**HC**  
All this discussion yet not a single actual recommendation in this thread dafuq XDDDDD

**Witne_SS**  
Today, on my way to my part\-time job, I suddenly heard a commotion coming from the crowd  
I turned around and I think I heard someone yelling NEKO's name  
So I just sort of instinctively press the shutter  
I ended up capturing a photo that's pretty amazing!!  
Looks like the internet rumors about PAFF hiding in NEKO's home turn out to be actually true!!!

### \[Repost\] Simon Jackson escapes from jail, jailbreak accomplice identity and wherabouts unknown
**Flower_Head**  
\[News\]\[Xenon\]\[Jailbreak\]\[Administration Bureau\]  
> According to our sources, in the middle of last night, several armed people broke into the restricted area. Their target was the prime suspect of the Æsir\-FEST incident Simon Jackson (Internet ID: Xenon), who was still in custody. Even though the Administration Bureau has stated that they will be holding a press conference to explain the situation once they sort out the details, it is almost certain that as of now, Simon Jackson is no longer under the control of the Administration Bureau.  
>   
> According to private interviews conducted by our reporter, the perpetrators' planning of this jailbreak operation was very carefully thought out. In addition to distracting the guards with words, they also destroyed more than a dozen armed drones. Fortunately, no casualties were found. Whether this was caused by the Administration Bureau's lack of discipline or the perpetrators being simply too skilled and well\-prepared remains to be determined. Right now, we can only wait patiently for the results of the investigation.

As long as Xenon has a PC, no one, and I mean no one, can keep him locked up

**SIhama**  
Bulls\*\*\* who in the right mind would give him a PC?  
It's like telling him "Please hacks us and break out of here"

**Go55ip**  
I have a suggestion   
We should hide in the bushes around Cherry or NEKO's house. I'm sure he'll show up some day lol

**4nonymous**  
A few people were all it took to break him out? What the f\*\*\* are the admins doing??? God they are useless

**fotoistruth**  
What an embarrassment XDDD The restricted area being made a complete joke by a few random folks LOLOL

**888fans**  
Is there nothing we can do about this?? Just let him get off scot\-free like that?? Has a wanted order been issued?

**Watch_Burn**  
Drones destroyed... dude, doesn't that sound like what a terrorist would do?? Did an entire army show up to bail Xenon out??

**Heart_Head**  
The admins are probably figuring out how they're going to explain such a major screw\-up to the public

**Nyd_Ans**  
The two sides probably already reached an agreement. All is well, all is well\~

**GemFeather**  
In all seriousness,  
if the perpetrators can destroy over a dozen drones, I'm certain that they must be professionals in the business

I have a friend who said that they really don't have a reason to hate each other

**KirinKiraKira**  
PAFF and NEKO have completely different target audiences, don't they??

**NekoSamurai**  
Imo, NEKO is similar to Robohead, as they both have a unique target market and very diehard fans.  
PAFF is just mainstream pop music

**Pixely99**

### \[Breaking\] Idol singer PAFF possibly spotted at Node 08 Tower after missing for months
**Flower_Head**  
\[Breaking\]\[PAFF\]\[NEKO\]\[Missing\]\[Eye Witness\]  
> Node 08 idol singer PAFF has been missing for months due to unknown reasons. During her absence, multiple incidents have occurred. From the fans' violent protest regarding Monophonic Entertainment's mistreatment of her disappearance; to the information discovered during the Æsir\-FEST investigations that linked PAFF's deteriorating health to a possible memory theft she suffered during the incident and more. Just as everyone is about to give up on the search for her, the case took a very surprising and drastic turn today.   
>   
> Earlier today, in Node 08 Tower, multiple pedestrians caught sight of PAFF together with well\-known streamer NEKO. However, the two quickly passed through the crowd and proceeded to disappear. Only a few witnesses were able to get out their mobile devices in time to capture some blurry photos. We are currently contacting Monophonic Entertainment and the Administration Bureau to confirm the details on this event.

Did someone inform sis Helena and Mono

**Trashtalker**  
Do they have something to do with Xenon's jailbreak? Are you two the mysterious armed people?

**HolyEarth**  
Well, if NEKO uses her gaming skills to control the drones, I can totally picture the havoc she'd cause (in a good way) LMFAO

**Iwanttoplay**  
So it was NEKO who wrecked all the admins' drones XD  
I'm going to tell my parents. This way, they're not gonna ban me from video games anymore\~\~\~\~\~

**Sayomi911**  
PAFF has returned!!! We'll get to see her perform live again\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

**Varinaya**  
Mono must be so happy that nobody's gonna s\*\*\* on them anymore ROFL

**m00nl16h7**  
PAFF is backkkkk!!!

**Paffy**  
Let's use PAFF to bait Xenon out. He's a pretty hardcore PAFF fan right???

But this... I can wholeheartedly support this\~\~\~\~\~

The only diva in my heart is PAFF and it will stay that way!!!

I fell in love the first time I heard her music  
It has this magical power to lure you in!!!

**STANley**  
Woah is this the arrival of the diva era? Can she surpass PAFF??

**CHanatsuka**  
How exactly is NEKO doing this lololol  
What did she do to net her a collab with a Tier\-1 singer like MIKU\~?

**vveay**  
Saito Production and Monophonic Entertainment, which one is bigger??

**lrrllrrl**  
Saito pretty much dominates the market in Node03  
They just haven't officially released their stuff in Node08

**JAC-jack**  
MIKU! MIKU! MIKU!

**Noposa**  
Don't you weebs dare look down on our NEKO!  
She earned everything with her true skillz!!

**HandsomeYi**  
Wow a NEKO fan calling someone else a weeb... Look in the mirror first, will ya??  
MIKU 4 life!!! I've already saved up the ticket money for the next LIVE!!!

**C.Y.**  
Stop putting out limited editions! RIP my wallet.

**Hulujam**  
The name "Saito Production" sound so... dangerous, for some reason\~\~\~ Like they'll get into a brawl with someone who bumped into them on the streets (I blame the stereotypes\~ XDDD

**SYY**  
Used to be a PAFF fan, but immediately change sides after hearing MIKU's songs (No regrets

**JOEZ Cafe**  
I don't know who the hell it was that suggested I order some YAMAMETO fruit beer.   
I shipped in several boxes and ain't no one's ordering it!!  
Should've trust my instincts  
Tomato with hops!? The only palates that can handle that are sickos and smashed drunks\~\~\~

Now there's this giant mountain of YAMAMETO just sitting there behind the bar...  
All it takes it's a fatso to crash into them and we'll have ourselves a massive explosion\~

I just saw a group of things fly by the clock tower here at the Academy.   
Are they drones? I've never seen them flying in a massive group like that.

Which way were they flying toward?

**Arya_Poke**  
Looked like they were going from Quadrant I to Quadrant III

**AbigaleJ**  
Definitely drones. I saw 'em too. But the group I saw was headed toward Quadrant II

**IronFan**  
Eh... Is it normal for drones to start crashing into buildings??????????

\[Breaking News\]\[Drones\]\[Attack\]\[Casualties\]  
> A few hours ago, there had been several eyewitness reports from Node 08 that reported abnormal flight patterns from drones. .Just now, we've also been gradually receiving news regarding the drones' attacks on the cities. Due to the extreme chaos at the site, the number of casualties and other details are still unknown.  
>   
> Based on the new embargo put in place by the Administration Bureau, to all citizens, please head to the designated safety shelters immediately. If the roads to such shelters have already been blocked, please remain indoors. Do not engage or attempt to fight against the drones.

Does anyone now what's going on?  
I heard explosions and screamings.   
Should I call the agents? What should I do??????

**EvilForce**  
Get you a\*\* moving and go to the shelters ASAP!!!  It's all written up there!! Can you not read the alert?

**SuduMan**  
My brother's a Law Enforcement Agent. Does this mean he'll have to fight these drones?   
I'm so worried about him...

**kou**  
My mom just escaped from the chaos outside.   
She said the drones are crashing into pedestrians@@

**Blanky_Blank**  
if I need to protect myself, any idea what weapon will be effective??

**Silence_Bob**  
Dunno. I don't think they would allow that can hurt drones to be sold publically  
Maybe the agents' guns would work???

**T3RA_wr47h**  
Does the Bureau still have drones to deploy? Using drones to fight drones might just be the way to go@@!

**Popo**  
Has ARC's private security army been deployed yet?   
Aren't they the experts in dealing with these things?

**Neon_raven**  
One of them just crash landed into my building's courtyard...   
Luckily I live way up on a much higher floor.  
(ΩДΩ) So scared 0rz

**Prime6750911**  
Please be careful up there\~ Not the time to move around now...

**Talus_Alpha**  
Posting to report my safety. There didn't seem to be any incidents reported in my area... so far  
Must be because this place is so remote that not even the drones can locate it lol

**9tingale**  
Isnt reporting on this a bit dangerous? I'd much rather the reporters get the heck out of there than see them report on this...

**Poopytrap**  
My waifu NEKO... Is she okay????? I can give her my space here at the shelter!!!

**NekoSamurai**  
Idiot. She'll get killed on the way to your home. Don't be stupid

**Mick_Rorty**  
BTW, I just realize how ubiquitous drones are. They really are f\*\*\*\*\* everywhere! You never notice that until s\*\*\* like this happens

**Wickedragon**  
Come on it's just 1 or 2 broken drones. It's not like there's 30 of them so lets chillll

Bro STFU!! Don't jinx it you moron!  
EVERYBODY, look out for your own safety!!!

I'm stuck in a mall now. Just now, there were drones attacking the doors. There were screams and chaos. Luckily, the courageous people who worked at the mall thought fast and managed to get the blast\-proof doors up in time, which stopped the drones from getting in. But now we can't get out either.   
Looks like more and more drones are gathering outside. What should we do??

Good thing you're at a mall, so you won't run out of food...

Best weapon at a mall is definitely the frying pan...

Quick! Go and occupy the chocolate area! Will definitely will help you stay alive!!!\~\~

**Chevalier151**  
I wonder if there are any idiots who decided to occupy the frozen food areas????

**lrrllrrl**  
Take an insect spray and spray into the flames of a lighter. Voila\~ your friendly neighborhood flamethrower.   
You can also do it was hairspray and stuff like that\~

**SYY**  
Put a towel in a bottle of vodka and light the towel on fire. You need AOE damage to be effective again hordes!  
FIRE IN THE HOLE!!!!!

Probably because all his battles take place at light speed, so we can't see any of them ;\-)

**KirinKiraKira**  
Send Lightspeed to take care of the drones\~\~

**HandsomeYi**

If it's light speed how dafaq are we gonna watch?   
So the movie's gonna be 100% in slow motion??

Although instances of separate drone malfunctions did occur before this it's getting a little out of hand (Multiple drones malfunction all at once??)   
After all this, people are gonna get PTSD when they see a drone  Who do you think is the one pulling the strings behind the scenes?  
ARC? The Administration Bureau?? Xenon getting his revenge on society???

As for 08, this is indeed not the first time. It's practically part of daily already (?

And the relief pitcher of the year goes to... Xenon!

**SuperKY**  
Real Culprit: Oh no. Something's gone wrong. Quick, blame it on Xenon\~

**Arya_Poke**  
For real, I think ARC wants to use this opportunity to take back the control of all drones that previously belonged to the admins

**fotoistruth**  
I'm thinking the exact opposite. I think the admins don't want ARC to have too much power. Therefore, they're making people cautious regarding technology. This way, folks won't rely on ARC tech and products too much

**TunaLee**  
Hey dumba\*\*  
If the admins did that  
They're the ones that are gonna have to clean up the aftermath, not ARC  
Plus, how would they know that public opinion will be on their side once everything goes to s\*\*\*?

**GymGai**  
Imo I think us Mono. They want to get out of the entertainment industry and join the military industry XD

Annnnndddd the s\*\*\*posting begins again  
Didn't even make it past the 10th comment this time

**UltraKY**  
TBH, I might freak out a little when I see a drone on the streets after all this, even if it's just the trash\-collecting type...

**888fans**  
If a hacker is really this good and can hack this many drones at once, there's no way ARC wouldn't know about this person, right?

**T.Goldwell**  
If we're to talk about hackers, I have a feeling that Xenon will be brought up again        \~OwO\~

**Sopheee**

### PAFF is home now. Reporting her safety and an apology
**Helena**  
Hello everybody, this is Paff's older sister Helena White

First, I'd like to thank all of you for your support and encouragement you've given since PAFF went missing. If it weren't for all your passion and consolation, I don't know if I'd still be here today. Also, I'd like to especially thank anyone who has provided tips and assistance in finding PAFF.

PAFF has contacted us in the past few days and we now know that she is both safe and has trustworthy friends by her side. Since a lot of complicated things have happened, it's not possible to explain them all here, so I am very sorry about that. I feel like she needs some time to collect herself too. Therefore, I  just want to inform everybody that there is no longer any need to search for PAFF, so please refrain from asking for her exact whereabouts. Whether or not she will return to the stage as an idol singer is entirely up to her. If she ever makes a decision, we will announce it.

Thank you, everyone, for being with us all this time. The pain that has been felt cannot be forgotten, but everything we have now means the world to us. Thank you.

The video message above is a message to all of you recorded by PAFF herself. Hope everyone can feel at ease now.

Helena White

After all the drone attacks, there's no way I can live in the same city as those heartless machines anymore.  
Gods of IM, please recommend a place where I don't have to ever look at a drone again. I'm so ready to move.  
Besides, I've been single ever since I left the fetus (Entering year 35 now), so it doesn't really matter.

**KingOtaku**  
More info please? On 13

**Varinaya**  
A serious accident happened in 13 in the past, so there was this huge anti\-technology movement  
When ARC first tried to set up a location there, there was even a major riot

**NoLifeGamer**  
I think running to 13 just to avoid the drones is a little extreme  ;P  
The electrical system there is so basic  
and the internet isn't available everywhere  
you're gonna get bored to death

**KingOtaku**  
!!!??? No internet. Sorry then. Can't do it.   
How am I gonna watch all the "useful" stuff over there if there's no internet?

**\#YuriIsLoveYuriIsLife**

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**  
And the answer is\~\~\~ding ding dingヽ（Φ∀Φ）ノ  
This is my old home back at 03\~\~\~\~  
Is it because I'm so damn fashionable and advanced that you all thought I was born in Node 08??

**w_Rosabel_w**  
Uhhhh u sure you want to say this on a live stream? Though I don't mind since I'm a fan XDDDD

**RyanRii**  
NEKO's usual wacky hijinks ensue\~\~\~

**Heart_Head**  
03 really is nowhere near as advanced as 08   
That's no secret XDD  
Just the fact that there's no giant ARC UFO floating over there makes it a very different place

**JaneHikaru**  
Nahhh, NEKO sometimes uses terms that are from 03... and She's got a slight 03 accent

**NEKOSAIKOU**  
Whatever NEKO, doesn't matter where you're from I'll love you anywayz!!!

**Saitoyota**  
So there's a chance that we went to the same high school!!!!

**Smurky**  
NEKO, you gonna put out a song today \*gets smacked\*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**  
I came back with some friends\~  
Gonna go grab a bite to eat in a bit\~\~\~\~  
The night market around my home is fire!!!

**Pixely99**  
So who'd you go back to 03 with, NEKO???  
Hope it wasnt nekosaikou LMFAO

**NEKOSAIKOU**  
I wish! I sure as s\*\*\* wish that I was the one  
Too bad it's a damn pipe dream QQQQ

**PoolsKitten**  
There's no way that it's PAFF... is it?

**FCodex**  
Hmm, it's very likely. Besides, didn't PAFF have Sis Helena post a message for her? Maybe she's taking a vacation with NEKO in 03 now!?

**NEKOSAIKOU**  
Shhhhhhhh, don't ask if you can't handle the truth.

**foreheadless**  
With NEKO's personality  
if PAFF really is there, do you really think she's gonna keep her off screen? XD

**Yamatsuki**  
YUMMY!!! NEKO, tell me where you're eating at Pls!!!

### Anybody know what the final passcode for See2 is?
**Hulujam**  
Lately, a friend sucked me into  
buying the game See2: US  
After beating it all, this screen popped up and asked for a password to unlock extra content  
Does someone know the password?  
or did I miss something??

You should look for it yourself\~\~\~

**DewittSteiger**  
Why are you people giving him such a hard time??  
Is this what IM is like now?  
It's obvious he's asking for an answer. Is it really that hard to give a proper reply?  
Or maybe everyone is just pretending to know when they really don't?  
Is this really necessary? Are you all stupid?

**JessiaAvison**  
Dude, you're the one who's stupid here. Some (or I should say most) people prefer not to spoil a game in a comment section.  
Calling people out doesn't make you better; it just makes you look like a hypocritical fool who doesn't know what he's bumbling about.

**beeeeeeeeee**  
Come on let's not argue over See2.   
Isn't everyone talking here bc we all really like this game?

**Noposa**  
Nah Im here for the drama. I prefer Dii2

**HolyEarth**  
I'm just passing by.  Grinding the current Stewrica event now

**beeeeeeeeee**

**Curo**

**KiwaHu**  
I pronounce it "See2: US".

### \[Repost\] Administration Bureau holds press conference in response to recent drone incidents
**Andy_Roid**  
\[News\]\[Drones\]\[Attack\]\[Administration Bureau\]  
> An Administration Bureau spokesperson stated: "Concerning the recent sporadic incidents of drones injuring people on accident, our early analysis has labeled this as a system error within the automatic control center. This error caused the system to mistakenly sent unrelated commands to the drones which caused them to malfunction and act abnormally. We've already activated the security protocol. This will increase the patrol frequency of armed Law Enforcement Agents, as well as improve the anti\-drone capabilities of Enforcer Drones."  
>   
> At the same time, A.R.C's Recreated Technology Department also stated that they will be assisting in the investigation to determine if there exist other safety concerns that have been overlooked. However, regarding the drones in use right now, they reaffirmed that there is no need for the public to be worried...

I'm pretty sure all the, you know, DEATHS have made everyone uneasy

**NerfThat**  
Okay maybe if you look at the total number of drones, this ratio of malfunction is indeed extremely low??

**Brightswirls**  
I tell you what. Those people who were there at the accident site that day will definitely not think like that...

**Ewx_Data**  
Aren't these things supposed to have ZERO malfunctions????????  
Like people are actually DYING because of this!!!!

**fotoistruth**  
Is anyone as worried as I am?   
What if the Enforcer Drones go berserk as well? Isn't that gonna be way worse with all that "improvement" they made?

**Amberclove**  
I also think that improving the firepower for Enforcer drones is dumb and really terrifying

**888fans**  
I bet you 5 bucks what they thought was: As long as the Enforcer Drones don't malfunction, everything is a\-okay\~\~\~\~

**CozyCaty**  
Speaking of ARC, they sure have been f\*\*\*ing up a lot lately...

**Bolt_Urx**  
When nothing happens, people don't usually think about ARC.  
But then you realize that almost all technology you see in your daily life is under their control lol

**RaiKiyumi**  
The Law Enforcement Agents really got it tough 0rz. No wonder my dad doesn't want me to take the exam

### \[Repost\] Large\-scale drone attacks occurred in Node 08, Quadrant II
**Flower_Head**  
\[Breaking News\]\[Drones\]\[Attack\]\[Shelter\]  
> In Quadrant II of Node 08, at least 10 suicide drone attacks have occurred in areas that are densely populated. The detailed number of casualties is not clear, though the firefighters who responded to the site first have stated that the situation does not look optimistic.  
>   
> At around 3 P.M., the first wave of attacks struck a Law Enforcement patrol post in the outskirts of Quadrant II. Multiple citizens and Law Enforcement Agents suffered minor and critical injuries. Of the critically injured, three already showed no signs of life by the time medical personnel arrived at the site. A witness of the attack told this NNN reporter, that after the first wave of attacks, the remaining drones continued to head toward the business district, most likely preparing for the next attack.  
>   
> Since these incidents showed clear signs of a terrorist attack, the Administration Bureau has issued an order for first\-priority precautionary measures to be taken. All Law Enforcement Agents will be deployed to conduct the investigation. In addition, the flying permits for all drones that are on standby have been revoked. However, drones that are currently conducting missions or offline are still out of their control. If the situation calls for it, these drones will be destroyed or brought down by force.  
>   
> Based on the news embargo put in place by the Administration Bureau, to all citizens, please head to the designated safety shelters immediately. If the roads to such shelters have already been blocked, please remain indoors. Do not engage or attempt to fight against the drones. Node News Network will continue to broadcast this event by images, text, or audio.

### \[Repost\] Node 08 Quadrant II suffered devastating drone attack
**Flower_Head**  
\[News\]\[Drones\]\[Attack\]\[Quadrant II\]  
> Node 08 Quadrant II's business district suffered a severe drone attack incident. Rumors have come out stating that the attack has left at least 30 dead and over 200 civilians injured. As of now, the Administration Bureau has sealed off all traffic routes entering and exiting that area. Anyone who passes through the area, including pedestrians traveling on foot, must undergo examinations before they can proceed ahead.   
>   
> Node 08's business district is a hub area that has always been the most bustling place in 08. Notable landmarks such as Monophonic Entertainment HQ, Central Music Hall, and the Live House District were all affected by the attack to varying degrees. Fortunately, when the attack occurred, most stores had yet to start their business for the day. However, some stores were not as fortunate. For example, the Old Town area, home to the Jazz Bar "JOEZ Cafe" and the renowned Department Store "The Fountains", was pretty much reduced to rubble. The dining street, which houses famous restaurants like "Pizzattic" and "Singularity", also didn't survive the attack and was destroyed almost entirely.  
>   
> According to the Administration Bureau, in contrast with the previous sporadic drone malfunctions, this incident was very clearly a targeted attack. There were even instances where large drones crashed into buildings while carrying energy cells or fuel. These cases of suicide attacks have resulted in at least a dozen high\-rise buildings suffering structural damage. Official sources have yet to confirm whether this attack was caused by terrorists or not.

### HEY Y'all! I'm still alive!
**JOEZ Cafe**  
Ummm, h\-hey guys\~\~ I'm still alive haha\~\~  
Sorry, it seems like I freaked everyone out  
When my store got blown up, I just so happened to be crushed underneath all those cases of Yamameto  
Those nasty drinks ended up absorbing most of the impact for me, which kept lil' ol' me alive (Turns out I did the right thing ordering so much of that damn stuff!?)

The Yamameto explosion caused me to look as if I was covered in flesh and blood  
Maybe that's why I wasn't discovered by other drones? (Scratches head)

All in all  
Although there is still tons of stuff I need to sort out  
(Things that were reduced to ash not included, so it might be a lot easier than I thought)  
This post is more or less to report my safety to everyone  
Hope that other injured folks can hang in there and make it as well

### Did a quick scan of the more well\-known services on cyTus these days
**Henry**  
1. The new personal information trojan horse virus' affected range includes all connection devices before V11 (In theory, because I don't have devices before V5 with me. However, nobody should be using those XD)

2. The more they fix iM, the crappier it gets. However, the development team has announced the update plans for next season. Can look forward to it.

3. A random hacker group has stated that several major producers of connection devices and equipment have been infiltrated by scammers. In the future, there's a possibility that brand\-new connection devices will have virus programs built into them.

4. Some forum blocks have claimed that Mono's music platform has already been cracked; still unproven. There is a chance that this is true, but Mono has ways to stop this. For example, once they detect a user of the cracked version, they can immediately lock on to the user and inform the admins of their position. This action is totally legal in the current regulations of the Administration Bureau. Thus, I still advise everyone to not attempt this kind of stuff.

5. Perhaps not too many people have taken notice of this, but the cyTus main system hasn't been updated for quite a while now (People don't normally read this it's just my personal interest lololol). The internal version has been stuck at V24, which is rather confusing. A while ago, a list of updates for V25 were leaked by an insider. I was a little bit excited about it. Despite that, there hasn't been any action for such a long time. Anybody knows what's going on???

### Something we must tell everyone
**CherryPuNK**  
This is a sad news, but we have to let everybody know. Last week, our band's lead vocalist Cherry, real name Sherry Pauline, has left us due to an accident.

We're still in shock and disbelief regarding this sudden tragedy. She is so considerate, so kind, and so talented. Our thoughts and prayers are with her family and friends, as well as all of you who loved her.

Cherry PuNK the band was born because of Cherry. She's the one who gathered us to realize our dreams of playing music together. We three have decided to suspend any band activities indefinitely. We would like everybody to give us some time to heal and collect ourselves.

Last but not least,  
For Cherry

You will always be in our hearts

### I have lots of questions...
**Gogossip**  
A tier\-1 artist for Mono just dies all of a sudden  
Does nobody feel that there's something very strange about this whole thing?  
Personal speculations in the comments
### Replies
**Gogossip**  
Question 1. The cause and the location of death are not stated clearly.  
Usually, the death of public figures should be accurately explained to the public.

**Gogossip**  
Question 2. Xenon, who has a close relationship with Cherry, is still a fugitive on the run.   
Could he know something or, maybe this whole thing it's related to him in the first place?

**Gogossip**  
Question 3. The band's post said that it was an accident;  
however, if it's an accident in public, there should be news or a report of some kind. Is it an accident that cannot be divulged?

**888fans**  
It certainly is indeed a bit ambiguous...

**Axroid_Sona**  
Don't mention Xenon anymore XD

**Go55ip**  
Xenon is mentioned so regularly these days that it's not a surprise anymore

**Poopytrap**  
Does any news report mention the cause or the location of Cherry's death?

**9me**  
I checked it a bit; none so far...

**Tracix**  
Maybe it didn't happen in 08 at all?

**GymGai**  
I used to hear a rumor that Cherry was involved with gangs during her school days.  
But who believes that kinda gossip magazine?

**Revneger**  
If it is a vendetta, what is the reasoning?

**AAAnton**  
The media has tended not to clearly explain the causes and outcomes of social incidents recently.

**Damn3D**  
Are conspiracy theorists all a little anti\-social?

### Hey...
**Joe**  
Never thought that after our last performance together  
I'd be reuniting with you under this kind of circumstance and atomosphere  
Guess the Crystal PuNK music festival we promised back then has now been postponed indefinitely  
The remaining three of us will get kicked out of the livehouse with our horrible singing  
Lots of people came today  
I know you'd like to quietly be by yourself  
Hope you don't find them noisy  
Your farewell is way too cool and way too rushed  
They are still tons of things they would like to tell to you...

I drastically changed my posting style just for you lol

Holy moly so it’s really just an error, not a terrorist attack??

Stay alert. may be a trick...  
Once we relax, the next wave of attacks will come

Even worse... the meals inside have expired XD

Missed the point wwwww, but it looks too weird to return to normal just like this  
Are we supposed to pretend like nothing's wrong?

If there's really someone manipulating all those drones  
it's gotta be a nerd

> The drone attacks that lasted for several days seemed to have been brought under control at noon today, stopping the destruction that rained down on the city and the attacks on citizens at almost the same time. Drones even returned to their normal flight patterns to begin working again. This has caused citizens to wonder whether it was just an error or a terrorist attack that was been carefully designed.  
>   
> However, due to the heavy losses caused by the attacks, the Administration Bureau was initially unable to propose an effective solution. That was until the A.R.C. indicated its willingness to support, thereby initiating military counter\-attacks. Many citizens expressed great dissatisfaction; the reputation of the Administration Bureau has reached its lowest level in the past two decades.

Æsir?? Xenon??  Coincidence? I think NOT!

**Talus_Alpha**  
And if it’s a hacker terrorist attack, Xenon could definitely do it

**Wickedragon**  
The big boss in Node 08 is ARC after all  
The admins r just their dogs

**JaneHikaru**  
The admins have such a weak social network. How do they have the right to manage the city???

**DuskDawn**  
I think it’s a terrorist attack... definitely a conspiracy

**PoolsKitten**  
Whatevs it’s okay now\~  
Everyone can return to normal life.

**AbigaleJ**  
No way. I think I have PTSD and can’t get close to drones anymore

### What's the point of keeping military drones in service??
**WhiteEYE33**  
The Nodes are so small, how can they let those missiles be flying back and forth?  
Even if they're suppressing the gangs,non\-lethal force is normally used first  
Why don't the admins simply decommission those drones?  
After they were hacked they just became even more useless.

Just in case\~  
What if the terrorists or gangs have greater firepower?

They still need to consider the damage that might be caused to the city

If the TOWER is blows up  
half of the city would disappear...

Be careful. you guys might be blacklisted for dangerous speech w

if they keep letting those heavy\-armed drones exist,   
who can keep that power under control?

\[Emergency\]\[Evacuation Report\]\[Node08\]  
> Based on information gathered from an independent source, the large number of human\-shaped machines that are currently roaming Node 08 are Architects from the Decommission that had vanished without a trace. Although we are unable to determine why they have reappeared and begun attacking humans, we have received news that they are heading towards the  A.R.C. headquarters in mass. All we can be sure of is that the Administration Bureau and A.R.C. are trapped in a vicious battle. Citizens that have already dispersed and evaded danger, for your safety, please do not return to sites of danger.  
>   
> Based on the Administration Bureau's media blackout rules, we urge citizens to head to your corresponding shelter to avoid danger. If, on the way to the shelter you encounter any obstructions, head inside and do not engage with or resist the human\-shaped machines. 08 Daily will continue to broadcast various footage, text, and audio related to the situation.

I posted this article.  
It's 110% accurate.  
Everybody must be extremely careful. Take care of yourselves.  
They'll be some big news on Xenon, don't miss it.

**Gogossip**  
The independent source is Vicky!? It's definitely reliable!

**AntiMetal**  
Xenon's back????  
Did he do this????

**CyberLord**  
He's not this evil.... plus, he doesnt have that kind of cash to make that many robots

**Arya_Poke**  
The tech for manufacturing Architects has long been unreliable  
Otherwise they'd have made this high\-functioning stuff long ago. Way too convenient

**11IIll11**  
They could easily replace drones  
and to be honest, they could easily replace humans too...

**Marshall**  
Xenon!?!?!?!?

**Quest_ION**  
What's this sensational news stirring up now  
Whitewashing?

**Go55ip**  
Xenon's back?

**Copper_stone**  
Vicky's my idol!

**888fans**  
Vicky takes her journalistic integrity seriously, worth praising and quite moving

**CeeJay**  
This isn't the 08 Daily I know  
Shouldn't they be writing about a love affair between Xenon and an Architect or something!!!

**xxScarlexx**  
Geez, gossip news reporter doesnt know anything stimulating to write about so just starts writing real news  
Trying to whitewash this crap?

**4nonymous**  
Isn't Xenon hiding out in a different Node?  
Heard someone in 03 saw him

**TreeNoAlice**  
Boss just sent out a message saying that even though there weren't any robots spotted, please do not go near the company. Said people are looting the place. One of the storage spaces has already been robbed clean. The security guards and temp workers were locked in the storage room. Don't get it. How can people be doing this to others at a time like this? Isn't it the time for people to join together??

Stuff like this happened during the drone attacks

Disgusting. Doing it while the Bureau can't deal with them

**TreeNoAlice**  
Some pics were posted in the company group  
They're stealing and lighting stuff on fire  
Mental sickness!!??  
Take care everyone  
Maybe those robots aren't the only things to watch out for

**Chevalier151**  
Some people just like causing chaos

**DuskDawn**  
Let the Architects deal with them

guy above me aint right wwww the Architects allowed them to do this\~\~\~

**RyanRii**  
Point is take care of yourself first

**TobeTobe**  
Think some stores around me have been looted 2

**KamiCherry**

haven't run into a single drone or Architect

### \[Repost\] Wanted criminal Xenon appears suddenly and averts crisis
**Flower_Head**  
\[News\]\[Æsir\]\[Robots\]\[Attack\]\[Administration Bureau\]  
> We've gathered first\-hand information on the scene revealing that after having a warrant issued for his arrest, the main culprit for the past internet crime incident, Simon Jackson, appeared for the first time in Node 08 to help alleviate the disaster.  
>   
> Earlier today, Simon Jackson appeared on a blocked off street in the heavily affected Quadrant II. Using firepower as a scare tactic, he attempted to lure the human\-shaped machines far away from the citizens, thereby preventing the calamity from spreading. Soon after, when reporters of this network were at risk of being attacked, the Administration Bureau's Armed Forces and Simon Jackson provided assistance immediately.  The Armed Forces loosened Simon Jackson's handcuffs and said, "It was him who saved everybody."  
>   
> Why Simon Jackson decided to show his face at this time remains unclear. But what we know is that this kind of selfless action taken to protect fellow citizens is hard to come by, and can only be attributed to a real hero.

**PoolsKitten**  
This is not a joke  
Whatever it is he risked himself

**AbigaleJ**  
what happened b4 is still not clear, but saving people n risking himself, damn

**Wickedragon**  
Wait a sec!!!  
doesnt this mean the Bureau has no power??  
Letting a known criminal go???

**LyLah1207**  
Was it the choice of the commander on the scene? He did save people so its kinda understandable

**Dogleg**  
Xenon is a friggin beast. if he's on the side of justice it'll be a win for the good guys...

**CherryMyLife**  
in times of need, we need all the help we can get

**Brightswirls**  
It's not right to let him go.... there needs to be a clear line between right and wrong\~\~

**ElinaDaniel**  
08 Daily's Vicky just let out another article. Looks highly likely that Xenon was framed!!

**CyberLord**  
Just saw it. Losing one's memory is a scary thing

Gettin wrapped up in all this

**Xenon**  
Life has gradually returned to its natural groove. I nearly forgot how much focusing on the music and performances one loves can help one relax.

I lost a lot recently. I won't lie to you, or myself, acting all high and mighty and tell everyone to cherish what they have. I'm sure many of you are just like me. There may be someone or something that is never going to be brought back to life. We're just going to have to try and find a way to emerge from the haze that is suffering and loss.

I'm not sure how frequently I am going to update my iM status. I'd like to spend more time with my family and loved ones. But if you think following this account will give you something of value, I won't take it down. At the very least, I can keep posting my show dates and new material.

I thought I had seen through Reality. Yet I discovered that reality's falsehoods far surpass those of the imagination. Only after shedding a multitude of identities did I discover that my essence is nothing more than a drop in the ocean. The only belief that remains is too frail to withstand even a single blow. Starting from today, I'll use my new position in life to continue uncovering those stories that have been buried from sight. That which is worth protecting will most likely gradually change my original intentions.

**Xzavis**  
And Yamameto's return...

**MatsuyamaC**  
Yamameto saved the boss' life, now he's like forced to buy stuff from Yamato Brewery wwwwww

**foreheadless**  
So, if we go to JOEZ will we see NEKO and Xenon?

**JOE**  
They're still not feeling so well  
I invited them, but still haven't got a positive response

**StuffyMouth**  
True  
Recently, X's articles and NEKO's stream feel a little different from before

**Duncan128**  
I think NEKO's is about the same, its just she looks like she's forcing herself to smile

**TobeTobe**  
Hope they're able to pull themselves together

**KamiCherry**  
Isn't Boss JOE close with all them  
Let's keep up the positive power posting \~\~\~

**RamenBot**  
Can I reserve 4 seats (?

**RyanRii**  
Is the pool table still there? Reset the records, I'm coming for a challenge!!!

**JaneHikaru**  
Just realized no one dared ask what the new flavor is XDDDDDDD

**Ulxy_34RTH**
