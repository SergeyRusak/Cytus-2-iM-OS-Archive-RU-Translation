HELLO~ <3

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Has everybody heard about the cyTus urban legend(ΦωΦ) ?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Legend has it that people who are online are in fact already dead for a while Σ Σ Σ (Φ ωΦlli )

**EvilForce**<br>
Not that uncommon nowadays isn't it?

**NekoSamurai**<br>
I have a friend who lives in Node03. He says that people often hit the streets at midnight and just randomly disappear 

**D33M0**<br>
That's the admins' responsibility to deal with issues like this; not quite an urban legend lol

**FCodex**<br>
I've heard similar things lol

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Exactly. But the real kicker is(ΦωΦ) before the body is found~ his online self is still interacting with other people!!!

**9me**<br>
