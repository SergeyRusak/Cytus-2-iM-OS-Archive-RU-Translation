**Noposa**<br>
It's the latest model of the meow headphones!!!

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Haven't used the internet in days\~ NEKO almost died\~\~ Does anyone have some interesting stuff to share▕Φ▽Φ)?

**Anom4ly**<br>
Does NEKO not know about PAFF's incident?

**NekoSamurai**<br>
Things are quite interesting at Mono right now lol

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Eh? Nyani? WTF??? Smells like sweet, sweet gossip! (Φ皿Φ)

**9me**<br>
Someone's streaming on\-site right now\~ PMed you the link

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Holy s\*\*\*! What the hell is this?? <br>
A protest ( ΦдΦ)！?

**Smurky**<br>
Since PAFF is now officially missing, the cream Puffs finally exploded XDDD

**MRArupaka**<br>
Most of the complaints are about Mono's handling of the incident. They were treating everybody like morons

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Hoho\~ so even PAFF is finally fed up with that s\*\*\*\*hole of a company? Nice choice(Φ∀Φ)b

**beeeeeeeeee**<br>
Nice choice wwwwww

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Well\~ As ya all know, big companies are all shady\-AF<br>
**\#NEKOIsAVictimToo**

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
TBH is she really missing though? Maybe it's just another publicity stunt\~：/

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Feel like if something really did go wrong, they would have kept it down like they always used to\~ ：\\

**FCodex**<br>
Stealing Robohead's emoticon lol

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
If it's stealing we're talking about, then Mono is LEAGUES ahead of me (Φ∀Φ)σ(Φ∀Φ)σ

**xxScarlexx**<br>
Past issues were never reported 'cause they pressured the media, right? If you think about it that way, then even this incident is really fishy

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
NEKO is just making a random guess though, hohoho (ΦωΦ)

**K1ssK1tty**<br>
You have a good point!! Probably all a set\-up!!<br>
Using underground gangs and the media to take down your competition, how convenient

**66TAN66**<br>
Money really is everything I guess @@

**AngerFang**<br>
If that's really the truth, then even Helena is faking it? How disgusting

**AngryFan**<br>
I mean, is there a thing about Mono that's NOT disgusting??

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Ehehehe\~ It's really just a random guess\~ no need for such crazy conspiracies ( ΦдΦ)

**Heart_Head**<br>
NEKO definitely has some more inside news to share XD

**NEKOLUV**<br>
GOSSIP! GOSSIP!

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Ah\~ time for dinner, gotta go. That's it for today, bye bye\~

**MeowKun**<br>
Ah, she ran away lolol

**akaja**<br>
Bye Bye\~\~
