**NekoSamurai**<br>
Were you dead asleep until now XDDD

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
cyTus Lobby was broadcasting PAFF's new song before I went to sleep; that was a horrible night of sleep ((ΦдΦ))

**C_H_U**<br>
Wait, isn't that in the morning. Man you how long were you asleep LOL

**Uxi**<br>

**KirinKiraKira**<br>
Instant Ban lmfao XDD

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
It p\*\*\*\* me off so hard when I remember one of NEKO's compositions was taken by them GRRRRR(Φ皿Φ╬)!

**NEKOSAIKOU**<br>
Not surprised. Mono is a bunch of retarded A-holes. Good thing NEKO is no longer under their contract

**Poopytrap**<br>
It's not the first time Mono is accused of plagiarism. They don't give a damn about copyright

**EvilForce**<br>
I've heard that even if you listen to NEKO's old songs, NEKO doesn't get a single penny. Everybody boycott that s\*\*\*!

**NekoSamurai**<br>
I've deleted anything related to Mono lol

**MirriLL**<br>
Did NEKO meet PAFF when you were still at Mono?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Yeah, she's one arrogant b\*\*\*\*<br>
I was just trying to say hi to her, but I was completely blocked off by the guards (ΦдΦ)

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
One time I met her in the bathroom. NEKO said hello to her; she just turned and left!! Who does she think she is!

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Another time we accidentally bumped into each other in the elevator; it's the agent who apologized to me((  ΦдΦ  ))

**Poopytrap**<br>
NEKO 's raging HARD <3 lolol

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Is she speech-impaired or what? During my time at Mono I never heard her say a single word (((  ΦдΦ  )))

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
I bet her singing voice is completely synthesized <br>
(((((     ΦдΦ      )))))

**w_Rosabel_w**<br>
There was a rumor that PAFF was only there for her looks; the singing is actually done by someone else lol

**KirinKiraKira**<br>
I've heard of ghost producer; there's ghost singer as well? ROFL

**loveIris**<br>
LMFAO

**TunaLee**<br>
My friend works at Mono as a cameraman. The story he heard was that PAFF had a car accident when she was young. The car accident erase all her childhood memory, causing her to become extremely introverted

**TunaLee**<br>
He said that it was a nightmare trying to take photos for her, as communication is literally impossible without her agent XDD

**EvilForce**<br>
So does she actually talk lol

**9me**<br>
Memory lost via car accident LOL

**D33M0**<br>
Isn't that Deemon8's story?

**9me**<br>
Man that's a shitty story lol

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
That story is a bunch of baloney. It exists only to manipulate the fans

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
NEKO's gonna play with MeowBot now (  ΦˋдˊΦ)=3 Hmpf
