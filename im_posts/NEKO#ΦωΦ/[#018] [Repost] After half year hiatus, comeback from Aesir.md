> ... Regarding Æsir, who disappeared half a year ago, countless questions were raised among fans. In addition, the news of his comeback came from a very mysterious source, adding more uncertainty to his return....<br>
Not good news to read when I just woke up (╬ΦдΦ)<br>
No one will give a damn about his comeback if he didn't give an explanation (ΦωΦ)!<br>
Here's a song that represents my mood now,「Blow my mind」!
