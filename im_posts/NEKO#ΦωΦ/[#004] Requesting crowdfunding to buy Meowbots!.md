> ... One can imagine that in the future, AI will no longer be just a combination of random personalities. It can have its own identity and the ability to understand human nature. AI can assist humans in fields like social welfare, medical care and even more minor things like taking care of pets; all things that the existing AI can't do...<br>
I'm ready to buy a dozen MeowBots ~~~<br>

Besides doing chores and standing on the sweeping robots<br>
They can even help compose in the middle of the night, like little elves <br>

**MeowBat**<br>

**KirinKiraKira**<br>
Wait, if that's the case then what will you be doing XDD

**D33M0**<br>
A song compose by cat robots will likely only contain non-stop purring lol 

**Shibawu**<br>
If it really get 3600% faster then you can challenge **@ROBO\_Head** for the record of fastest time to compsoe a song lol

**ROBO_Head**<br>

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>

**Xenon**<br>
I fiddled with its prototype before. I say that it's nothing more than a decoration. 

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
S...shocked!! The Cool-AF Xenon bought little kittens (Φ∀Φ) pffft

**Xenon**<br>
....It was a gift from a sponsor.

**NnNn**<br>

**MirriLL**<br>
I won't mind a 24/7 stream of a bunch of fluffy adorable kittens:)

**w_Rosabel_w**<br>
A cat stream will only feature them constantly pushing the camera around I think lol
