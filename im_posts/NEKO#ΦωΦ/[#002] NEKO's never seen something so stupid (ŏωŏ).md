I thought it was canceled due to problems with the venue?

**EvilForce**<br>
No it wasn't canceled, the warm-up performances did go through.

Baited lolol

**w_Rosabel_w**<br>
Used to listen to his songs a lot.<br>
But deleted them all after he scammed everybodyヽ(`Д´)ノ

**Smurky**<br>
Never heard of him. Is he famous?

**FCodex**<br>
Æsir and NEKO have completely different styles it's pointless to compare them. 

**MirriLL**<br>
The songs are pretty nice, but I did not go to Æsir-FEST

**Noposa**<br>
Agreed, songs are nice

**Talus_Alpha**<br>
It's because of the blackout right?

**Poopytrap**<br>
I get an urge to puke every time I think about it, anyone has the same problem? ：Q

**Zigzag**<br>
Is it so bad that you want to puke ROFL

**C_H_U**<br>
I attended it; I was completely fooled!!!!

**NekoSamurai**<br>
The whole thing ended after Robohead's performance, the crowd went on a complete riot XD
