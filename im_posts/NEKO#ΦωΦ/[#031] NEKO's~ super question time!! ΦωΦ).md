Helllooo~~ Everyone~~~ NEKO here~~~~ (\*Φ₃Φ)~♥<br>
Quick question for mah fans<br>
Any good hair dye recommendations out there~?<br>
The brand NEKO previously used decides to troll me with the sold-out tag! ◢···· ╰(Φ皿Φ)╯····◣

I did do a quick search, but there were a bazillion results. NEKO can't chooseヽ(Φˋ口ˊΦ)ノ<br>
SO! I decided to turn to the experts on iM σ ΦωΦ) Φ∀Φ)σ

Ladies and germs, you are witnessing someone who has too much money and decides to throw it in the trash<br>
I expect no less from NEKO's fans; you guys are the craziest bunch out there XDDD

I personally think Sasayaki's modern series are all pretty good<br>
Light slate grey, honey tea and linen brown are all quite popular

**aidan**<br>
I've used Sasayaki before!! Highly recommend it!! Not sponsored!!

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Light slate grey seems like a good choice. NEKO is considering!!

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
I shall list it as candidate No.1 (\*ΦwΦ)

**Noposa**<br>
Wait so you picked light slate grey rofl I thought you would pick that unicorn rainbow thingy XDDD

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
NEKO wants to try out the mature style sometimes too OKヽ(Φˋ口ˊΦ)ノ

Looking forward to seeing the result<3<3<3
