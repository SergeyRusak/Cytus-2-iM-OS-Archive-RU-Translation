People've been spreading s\*\*\* about him<br>
During his half-year long disappearance, is he composing in secret or he is escaping from loan sharks ΦωΦ?？

People who know the details please PM me ლ(ΦωΦლ)<br>
If you have his new song, even better <br>
Please continue to follow **@NEKO\#ΦωΦ**<br>

It's fake news I believe.<br>
TBH I am starting to wonder: does this person actually exist? Maybe you've been screaming at empty space all this time.
