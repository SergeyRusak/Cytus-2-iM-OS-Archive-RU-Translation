WOW it's ICECREAMFLY but why did they change their drummer? It was previously an uncle why is it a young guy now.<br>
But the young guy had a decent showing too

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
They said that he is a substitute for the day (\*ΦwΦ)

**UltraKY**<br>

The garbled text on top could not have come at a better time<br>
I have a feeling that it definitely covered up something gross

**RyanRii**<br>
This garbled text thingy seems to have a life of its own. It's creating all kinds of amusing comments<br>
ARC must be testing out their new artificial idiot system

**Heart_Head**<br>
This band is nice. I like this laid-back atmosphere, feels very relaxed

**Watch_Burn**<br>
Agreed. This is the first time I ever felt relaxed in a NEKO stream<br>
