> One can imagine that in the future, AI will no longer be just a combination of random personalities. It can have its own identity and the ability to understand human nature. AI can assist humans in fields like social welfare, medical care and even more minor things like taking care of pets; all things that the existing AI can't do.

[Hardware][Popular Science][Show]<br>
> Do you know why the cyTus server is placed in the skies? It's because the energy required to power the server is immense. With specialized solar panels covering the entire server, solar power can be effectively used to charge the server. Its location in the Stratosphere also means that turbulence doesn't really harm the architecture. The cool temperature in the lower portion of the Stratosphere, around 216K (\-57°C), also means that it's much easier to dissipate heat. <br>

> Another accident caused by illegal prosthetics, this time in Node 08's Quadrant III industrial area. A man suddenly went berserk at work. The pistons in his prosthetic right arm began to move on their own, attacking nearby colleagues and security guards that arrived on site to stop him. The accident left one dead and twelve injured.<br>
> <br>
> According to the official investigation, the man's prosthetic arm was purchased from the black market and is an illegally produced, defective product. The neural chips in the arm cause brain damage to the user. The chips may also experience short\-circuits and overcharge when the user's emotions are unstable. Node 08 Administration Bureau's medical committee urges the public to only use officially approved, safe prosthetics to prevent similar incidents from happening again. <br>

> The mysterious musician Æsir, who made a high\-profile concert announcement half\-a\-year ago, was exposed by famous internet DJ ROBO\_Head for the suspicious use of illegal methods to erase the memories of all connected users. However, the actual method and purpose of these actions are still unclear. Earlier today, we received some inside news from the law enforcement department of the Administration Bureau. The Bureau has initiated the investigation, and there is a possibility that this incident is related to the "streamer hacked" incident that occurred at the end of last month.<br>
> <br>
> Regarding this issue, the spokesperson for the Bureau stated that if the actual situation indeed matched the rumors and that the users' memories were erased, this will be the largest internet terrorist attack since Node 08 was established. "We are facing a unique situation never seen before. This is a brand\-new type of enemy, using a brand\-new method of attack." Davis, A.R.C.'s minister of internet security, also released an announcement earlier today, stating that they will be working together with the Bureau to locate the culprit and uncover the truth...<br>

ROBO\_Head should count as a Silicon\-based creature I think XDD Just like how Sci\-Fi novels describe alien creatures

**AliceinCytus**<br>
No matter what, I still can't remember anything about the concert<br>
Or should I say can I still remember anything?<br>
If I really do remember, is it really my memory of that day?

**NerfThat**<br>
I saw Dr. Hawkins on a show the other day. He said that although the memory is theoretically erased, the human brain has some kind of self\-defense mechanism. So there might be a backup hidden in the subconscious

**BUCK$**<br>
Ah man, times like this make you wish that you're a computer and you can just go into the subconscious to copy and paste your memory to your heart's content

**MAN_Dora**<br>
This is supposed to be an issue for the admins<br>
But the A.R.C. seems more reliable now

**AntiReality**<br>
I feel like rather than worry about some kind of terrorist attack, we should apprehend and restrict every person that could be a culprit

**AntiReality**<br>
You know, people like NEKO, ConneR...etc. are all pretty dangerous people<br>
Not having quarantines or restrictions on their internet usage is dumb<br>
Why are these potential risks allowed to roam freely among us regular folks???

**Heart_Head**<br>
I utterly disagree with every single word you just said

**SYY**<br>
Idiot. So you decide that other people's rights can be violated just because of some insubstantial sense of danger?

**AntiReality**<br>
You must be one of those idiot fans of theirs right? I can't and won't communicate with someone who can't think with their own brains sorry

**DustyAsh**<br>
Moron by doing that you're falling into the real culprit's trap

**Smurky**<br>
Can NEKO be released already? Like how it's impossible for her to be the perp!!!

**D33M0**<br>
I also feel that a mere streamer has no ability nor the necessity to perform an attack like this

**Marsh**<br>
Maybe because she wants to be famous?

**CyberLord**<br>
Dude she is already super famous. Didn't you see how many people were connected to her stream when she was attacked!!

[News][Administration Bureau][Unmanned Drones][Social Issues]<br>
> Yesterday, in the middle of the night, a law enforcement drone performing its routine patrol at Node 08 Quadrant I's automatic area accidentally attacked a civilian household in the area. A model LE\-117 Striker drone that belongs to the Node 08 Administration Bureau suddenly lost control and launched shock blast grenades at a civilian building.  The law enforcement agent who was controlling the drone remotely via a virtual connection also suffered minor damage to his brain when the error occurred. The good news is that the Administration Bureau instantly reacted and shut down the drone's battery, therefore no further damage was caused.<br>
> <br>
> This accident is the fifth incident since Node 08 was established where law enforcement drones accidentally harm/kill innocent civilians. Of the 5 incidents, the most noteworthy is the first, which occurred on December 9th, 680 N.A.\-: Cross Node transport system administrator Carly Pauline was accidentally involved in a gunfight between law enforcement agents and armed robbers on her way home from work. Back then, the technology for controlling drones was not mastered by humans yet, and the unfamiliarity with the technology led to tragedy. A model LE\-110 Striker accidentally unloaded its riot control machine guns against Carly Pauline, severely injuring her. She died from heavy blood loss before she made it to the hospital. This incident prompted the Administration Bureau to establish a rule stating that human remote controls are mandatory for any drone operations. However, it has been years since the rule was established, yet drone\-related accidents still happen...<br>

[News][Gang][Social][Ando]<br>
> Since the middle of last year, the law enforcement department (LED) of the Administration Bureau has launched a series of operations titled "Node 08 gang purge". These operations focus on rounding up illegal gang members and eliminating locations where gang activities are rampant. As of this month, 78 listed locations across all 4 quadrants of Node 08 have been targeted for compulsory criminal search. 55 members from major gangs such as the Ando Gang and the Baro Brotherhood have been found liable for the violation of the Organized Crime Act, Electronic Narcotics Prohibition Act, Criminal Intimidation and Extortion Prevention Act, and more. Also found in the criminal searches are 129 suspects who are involved in other criminal cases, hundreds of doses of electronic narcotics, 11 standard\-issue law enforcement rifles, and 50 pulse rifle magazines. <br>
> <br>
> During these operations, over 90 percent of the Ando Gang's leadership core has been arrested. Their funds have been blocked as well. The entire organization has been fatally crippled due to the lack of any leadership. Originated from Node03, this notoriously violent gang that once ruled over the Node 08 underworld as its largest gang is now nothing more than a mere name. <br>
> <br>
> According to the head of Quadrant II's LED, working in tandem with the Administration Bureau's "Node 08 gang purge" operations is just a small part of a bigger picture. The regulations for Cross\-Node traveling is set to loosen in the near future, so more people are expected to visit the Nodes. In addition to rounding up the gangs in each region, other illegal activities, such as smuggling, that harm the civilians' safety will also be investigated and punished according to the law when found. The goal is to improve security and create a positive image for the city. <br>

[News][Monophonic Entertainment][Riot][PAFF]<br>
> A protest broke out in Node 08's business district today. Angry fans surrounded Monophonic Entertainment's headquarters and a riot ensued. This protest is largely due to the fan dissatisfaction that has been building up since Monophonic's popular diva singer PAFF disappeared from the hospital she was resting in. Monophonic Entertainment's mishandling of the PAFF situation on top of the lackluster PR work they did afterward was what ultimately led to the chaos today. According to the drone analysis, there are thousands of protesters already on\-site and the number is still increasing. The building where Monophonic Entertainment is located has been sealed off for safety reasons. The company has also request security and other assistance from the Administration Bureau.<br>
> <br>
> According to our basic understanding of the situation, this protest is not headed by any specific organization or a thought leader. This protest was a result of an internet collaboration effort among fans using the hashtag **\#MonoWillPay**. Their main points of complaint are Monophonic Entertainment's insincere attitude towards handling the issues and their apparent hand\-washing of their artists to keep themselves clean. As of this moment, the entire protest has been relatively calm. No incidents of violence have been reported so far. Nonetheless, the Administration Bureau still deployed two squadrons of riot control drones around Monophonic Entertainment headquarters for security concerns.<br>

> As of the publishing of this report, Monophonic Entertainment has yet to issue a statement regarding this protest. Rumor has it that several high\-level directors will be addressing the crowd directly to settle the disputes. However, at the same time, there's also a different voice on the internet. Some have wondered if this entire event was just incited by people with malicious intent. They call for fans to stay calm and be alert; do not let others take advantage of your passion. <br>

Are they too bored or what?<br>
Why would you mob someone for something this stupid?

**Clairy**<br>
Is it just me, or does their appeals seem really vague?

**AbigaleJ**<br>
Probably for the compensation<br>
They want to see if they can pressure the company to pay up; that way they can earn some quick cash

**Wowow**<br>
I feel like launching a **\#FindPaff** is the more meaningful thing to do right now...

**Irisa0938**<br>
QAQ I want to take a few days off to help find PAFF too

**Copper_stone**<br>
Really hard for me to imagine that it would take this long to find someone in Node 08

**AaA**<br>
TBH, for a leaderless mob event like this, it's quite hard to tell if there's actually a mastermind behind the scenes

**BbB**<br>
This is the golden opportunity for rivals and enemies to take advantage of imo

**N0B0DY**<br>
Oh crap, my company is in the building right next to Mono HQ. We are definitely suffering collateral damage right now

**WoooooDy**<br>
Maybe ask your boss and see if you can leave early to avoid the mob???

[Announcement][Monophonic Entertainment][PAFF][Contract Termination]<br>
> ... After Miss White went missing without notice, we have also tried our utmost to search for her and handle the losses. However, her action is indeed a violation of her contract and has already caused the company a substantial amount of damage, including property damage, other contract artists getting injured and more. In addition, it has led to the mistrust between fellow fans and the company, something neither of us wants to see happen. <br>
> <br>
> Therefore, we hereby announce the following information to fellow fans and friends in the media: After taking all issues into consideration, we have reached an agreement with Miss White's agent, Miss Helena White. We will be terminating the contract between Monophonic Entertainment Inc. and Miss Aroma White, effective immediately. We will no longer be responsible for her future career as an artist...<br>

[News][Administration Bureau][Monophonic Entertainment][Riot][PAFF]<br>
> Following the incident a few days ago where angry fans surrounded Monophonic Entertainment Headquarters, a second riot erupted today. This one is largely believed to be related to Monophonic Entertainment's announcement of its contract termination with missing idol singer PAFF. Most fans viewed this as an act of evading responsibility, thus leading to today's incident. <br>
> <br>
> Earlier today, fans voluntarily gathered in front of the building once again. According to the analysis by the drone, the crowd this time expanded much faster than last time. This fast\-growing mob quickly jammed the entire traffic network around the site. The furious fans nearly caused the entire situation to go out of control. Fortunately, the Administration Bureau deployed squadrons of law enforcement agents and riot control drones in time to prevent the worst from happening. Using high\-velocity water streams, the agents were able to drive away the rioting crowd and arrest 12 suspects for excessive behavior, finally putting an end to the riot. <br>
> <br>
> Monophonic Entertainment later issued a statement regarding this incident. In addition to thanking the Administration Bureau for their timely and efficient help, they also expressed their grief for the actions of the rioting fans. They also restated their point, that Monophonic Entertainment has communicated with PAFF's agent, Helena White, about all the details regarding the contract termination. The two sides reached a peaceful and mutual agreement before the decision was made public. It was not an attempt to evade responsibility, which is what many people outside of the company have suspected. <br>
> <br>
> During the suppression, several dozen citizens got injured, mostly due to slipping on the wet surface. Even though no significant injuries were filed, this is still one of the larger physical protests in recent years. The Administration Bureau has treated this issue with extra care. According to several sources, the Bureau plans to form a special investigation team to research countermeasures. On top of that, since the iM system was used as a platform to organize such activities, the Bureau also plans to involve A.R.C., the administrators of the virtual city cyTus, into the discussions to prevent similar incidents from occurring again.<br>

Don't say it in such a casual manner!<br>
I just happen to pass by there a few minutes ago. The site is utter chaos! So many people were pinned on the ground by the law enforcement agents. Some of them even have their entire face covered in blood; it's really frightening

[Excerpt][Document][Colin Neumann Jr.][Drones]<br>
> The Drone is a type of mobile machinery that is equipped with a UI that's shared with the human brain. Originally, they were automatic tools used by the Architects for architecture, excavation, security and other purposes. After "The Decommission" and the disappearance of the Architects, humans founded A.R.C. to recreate and analyze the technology left behind. Due to how widely applicable and convenient the drones are, they are widely used in many fields, especially in areas where it's too risky for humans to venture ourselves.<br>
> <br>
> To explain in a level understandable by the general public, not only can these drones be remotely controlled through a shared UI with the human brain, they can also operate on their own by algorithms inputted in advance. The algorithms can be written so that these drones will follow a certain set of principles when they operate. Unfortunately, humans have yet to fully grasp the algorithms used by the drones. This shortcoming led to many accidents (Including the model LE\-110 Striker human assault incident that occurred in 680 N.A.). On top of that, even when remotely controlled via the shared UI by a human, incidents where the drone frankly ignored the pilot's directions and acted on its own were still fairly commonplace. In some large\-scale simulations, the connection error rate even reached a staggering 3%. Of course, as you may have guessed, this number is nowhere to be seen on A.R.C.'s research conclusions.<br>
> <br>
> From model LE\-112 to LE\-119, there are a total of eight drone models operating in the field right now. All of which are left behind by the Architects and each one has its own unique purpose. For example, large machinery and model LE\-115 drones often handle demolition duties during an excavation. Under human modifications, each model also has different add\-on equipment sets labeled A\~C. However, in exchange for the add\-ons, the connection yield rate has further diminished compare to the basic modules. As with the most primitive LE\-110s and LE\-111s, they have more units left behind than any other model. However, due to the constant string of accidents involving them, all units have been removed from field operations by the Administration Bureau. Currently, they are sealed indefinitely in a warehouse located in the forbidden area.<br>
>  <br>
> It has been two hundred years since humans attempt to gain control over technologies we simply can't grasp. In the face of potential threats and unknown risks, we are unable to give up our innermost greed. We chose to seal them off, in hopes that one day we can truly uncover the secrets behind them. I can't say that this isn't a showcase of arrogant courage, but at the same time, the sheer lack of wisdom in this decision is also painfully noticeable. To those who made this decision, you have my sincere condolences.

[Riot][Monophonic Entertainment][Social Commentary][Show]<br>
> Welcome back to Blitz Newsline, the place where we provide news on the latest news. I'm your host, Jay. Alright, the Monophonic Entertainment riot incident that caused quite the ruckus these days has finally come to an end after the Administration Bureau interfered. This is a riot that escalated from a street protest, a rare sight in recent years. What kind of meaning does this represent? Our history expert Sid is here to answer the question. Hello, Sid!<br>
> <br>
> Thank you, Jay. As everyone may know, Node 08 has had dozens of street riots just like this one throughout history. Most of them occurred around 200 to 100 years ago. Judging by the records, that time period was when the Architects just disappear and humans were starting to attempt to survive on their own.<br>
> <br>
> Alright, Sid, you stop there. Let us turn to our tech expert Yu. Yu, do you have any idea what Architects are?<br>
> <br>
> Jay, you're underestimating me. Of course I know what Architects are! In fact, I know them very well! I wrote a report about how the Architects helped humans rebuild civilization as my Academy project. What do you know, I graduated with the highest grade. The best\-looking girl in my grade even became my wife. I can guarantee you that if the Architects reappears, I'm the person that can communicate with them the best!<br>
> <br>
> Got it. Sid, you mentioned something about how street riots have decreased a lot in the past one hundred years, right?<br>
> <br>
> Indeed, mostly because the Administration Bureau's policies gradually matured and the technology products under their control also increased. Take Node 08 for example; the last time we had such a major riot was 23 years ago. Back then, the reason for that was to protest the high taxes. That incident concluded after the law enforcement agents arrested the leader of the rioters. What I want to say is, if an idol can create an incident of this magnitude, we need to discuss whether or not...<br>
> <br>
> Stop right there, Sid. We don't need to delve that deep into tiny details; the ratings are dropping. Yu, after we returned from commercials we'll talk more about your Architect report and your hot wife. Stay tuned!<br>

To be honest, it is pretty stupid to have a riot over something this insignificant

**lrrllrrl**<br>
Just my two cents, but I feel like the number of angry folks has decreased a lot recently. People are starting to think calmly about what they should do. That [FindingPAFF] website is a pretty good example

**ConneR**<br>
As you all may observe, the constant repeat of such foolish actions is the perfect showcase of human nature. We are the same as we are two hundred years ago. When we lost our direction, we humans will recklessly fly around in the darkness like headless flies. In order to fulfill our diminishing and selfish greed and desires, we still choose to resort to violence, threats, and force. A sad, neverending vicious cycle.

**RaiKiyumi**<br>
Trying to think of something to rebut sensei, yet couldn't even muster a word... I am sorry to be born a human

**Ewx_Data**<br>
I'm not to the point of complete despair. The value of humans needs to be created by our own hands. <br>
I believe Dr. ConneR will acknowledge this direction as well

**ConneR**<br>
Very well. Then the first thing we should do is to make sure worthless garbage like this show no longer exists.

[News][Node03][Explosion][Fire][Accident][Administration Bureau]<br>
> Last night, a series of chained explosions occurred in Node 03, Quadrant IV. It is suspected that a leak in the local pipeline system has resulted in at least 30 major explosions. The flames quickly engulfed the dozens of buildings nearby. Estimated casualties currently sit at 20 dead and 300+ injured. In order to prevent further accidents, Node 03's Administration Bureau has cut off the energy pipelines and electric power supply within a radius of several kilometers around the area.<br>
> <br>
> The epicenter of this disaster is Node 03, Quadrant IV's Genmu Boulevard. The explosions first began with several key buildings and following the explosions, a massive firestorm erupted.  From the images taken by the airborne surveillance cameras, we can see that the buildings were immediately swallowed by the inferno and created a mountain of thick smoke. Large squads of firefighting drones reached the accident site 90 seconds after the initial explosion. They started launching fire extinguishing bombs and firing high\-pressure water streams to keep the fire under control.<br>
> <br>
> The rescue workers themselves have reported multiple casualties due to the explosion and the subsequent fire. This includes 6 firefighters, 2 law enforcement agents and 5 possible researchers who were found wearing lab coats.<br>
> <br>
> According to the neighborhood, it appears that the power supply experienced some unstableness earlier today. The Administration Bureau's initial speculation is that a crack in the energy transport pipelines caused the accident. The Bureau has issued an emergency evacuation order to civilians who live within Quadrant IV's 203 \~ 903 areas. The head of the security council, Ryu Minatsuki, has also announced that the distribution centers will be opened to the civilians as temporary shelters. Rumors of an inner conflict between the Node 03 Administration Bureau and the gang organizations have been running rampant in recent years. It is yet to be determined if this series of explosions has something to do with gang violence and revenge seeking. The law enforcement department has already launched the investigation. <br>

Holy s\*\*\* Node03 is scary who the heck would want to live there

**Nexus697**<br>
03 is easily top 5 in terms of population though XDDDDD

**Mulder**<br>
03 is pretty much overseen by gangs, nobody's got the balls to say anything

**MirriLL**<br>
Not surprised, it's 03. Isn't it basically a tradition there to give babies a bulletproof vest on baby shower

**Abin**<br>
The admins over here are super useless<br>
The "private organizations" manage pretty much everything

**AbigaleJ**<br>
WTH is a security council?? We don't have that here in 08 do we??

Ya all a bunch of noobs<br>
It's just a shell for those thugs to cover up the s\*\*\*load of crimes they commited

Dude, do you live in Node 03?? You better look out for room service\~\~\~\~\~

Room Service! MDFK!!

Gold bless those who are injured<br>
No matter what<br>
these accidents are always the most brutal to the innocent civilians

Even if it's indeed an energy pipeline explosion, why are there no safety/prevention mechanisms at all? And the entire automatic fire suppression system broke down at the same time? I feel like there are some serious conspiracies behind this

**Popo**<br>
Gangs removing their enemies??

My colleague moved here from Node 03<br>
According to him, over half of his classmates were already directly or indirectly recruited by the gangs when they are still studying at the Academy

08 has very good security, we shouldn't be affected, right?

**Andy_Roid**<br>
With big brother ARC overseeing everything in the skies, I imagine even if there is an accident, it wouldn't be as destructive (I think?

Dude, don't jinx us LOLOLOL

[News][Administration Bureau][Law Enforcement Department][Human Trafficking][Pedophile][Cleanup Blitz]<br>
> In an attempt to stop cross\-Node human trafficking and online sex crimes which target young children, after six months of investigation, the special ops team of Node 08's law enforcement department launched a cleanup blitz yesterday. 16 suspects were arrested in Quadrant III and IV. Of the suspects, notorious pedophiles were among the criminals arrested. What's even more horrifying was that among the human trafficking group suspects, retired law enforcement agents and multiple minor gang members were also part of them.<br>
> <br>
> Davis, the head of A.R.C's internet security department who assisted the Administration Bureau in this operation, also stated that the human trafficking groups use the black market and encrypted internet connections for things like information trades and contraband transactions. However, under the assistance of A.R.C., the Administration Bureau was able to get their hands on a large amount of evidence, which allowed them to strike preemptively and crack this case.<br>
> <br>
> While the Node 08 Administration Bureau is carrying out the aforementioned operation, four other cities, Node 03, 11, 18, 47 are also launching their own investigations. As the spearhead of this operation, Node 08's law enforcement department stated during the press conference that they apprehended around 40 suspects. All suspects are currently going through interrogation.<br>

Another screw up by a retired law enforcement agent?? Why don't they just outsource the whole thing to ARC?

**AntiMetal**<br>
With somebody like Xenon at the helm are you really sure that's a wise decision????
