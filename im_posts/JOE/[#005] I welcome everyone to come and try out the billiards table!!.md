A while ago, I got someone to upgrade the firmware of the old billiards table<br>
Now we have even more awesome modes for everyone to have fun with\~\~

Starting today, I welcome everyone to come can try it out!!<br>
Whether you're sober or smashed<br>
don't be hesitant to pick up that long and thick rod\~ \*Blushes\*

If you can defeat the King of Germs owner<br>
You get to drink all the milk you want for the day!!!

I went and gave it a go the day before yesterday. It was a lot harder than I imagined.<br>
The owner is really, really good

**w_Rosabel_w**<br>
Wow, billiards. You don't see those very often these days

**TreeNoAlice**<br>
How do you play it? Do you swing it like a baseball bat and try to knock the ball into the pockets?

**JOEZ Cafe**<br>
You can't swing the cue\~ you have to aim carefully and poke your stick at the right hole<br>
