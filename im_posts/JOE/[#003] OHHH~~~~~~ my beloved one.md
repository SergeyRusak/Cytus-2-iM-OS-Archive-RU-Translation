Once upon a time<br>
I failed to cherish you<br>
Only until losing you did I start to miss you dearly<br>
Never have I thought that the one who betrayed me<br>
Would be my best buddy in the band<br>
He took you away from me, mercilessly (Yes **@Xenon**, I hate you)<br>
Yet he took no good care of you, tossing you aside like nothing<br>
Causing you to end up in the hands of a mad cat

BUT, this just in today<br>
YOU!<br>
HAVE!<br>
FINALLY!<br>
RETURNED!<br>
HOME!!<br>
TO!<br>
MEEEEEEEE!!!<br>
OH, my beloved Fonder, how I have missed you (French kiss)

That aside, it has truly been a while. Starting to miss the good ol' band days<br>
I will probably resume my role as a bassist very soon<br>
Does anyone here wants to JAM with me!?!? I am single and lonely and I need friends\~\~
