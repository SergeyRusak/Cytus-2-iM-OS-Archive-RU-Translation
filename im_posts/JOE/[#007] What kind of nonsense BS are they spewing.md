Haven't been this p\*\*\*ed off in a long time! My uncle always told me that paparazzi is a job for losers; today I finally get what he meant by that!! I've known Simon since the days of CP. His sense of justice and his dedication to his principles are simply unrivaled. I mean, this dude doesn't even drink booze in my shop! He orders milk all the time! Why the f\*\*\* would anyone think he is an internet terrorist??

Here's also a shoutout to all the damn reporters who want gossip on him. I sincerely invite you to check him out in my shop (Minimum order required). You can look at him while he's helping more people, trying to solve the case, and drinking milk. You'll realize that every word I said about him is absolutely true.

JOE OUT (Drops Mic)

Right on the point Uncle JOE !(ΦωΦ)!<br>
Xenon really working very hard to help everyone address the problems (ΦωΦ)/

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
NEKO is never afraid of reporters anyway<br>
You a\-holes better watch your back /(Φ皿Φ)/

**JOE**<br>
Umm... I don't think that's a good idea<br>
Aren't actions like these why you've been causing him so much trouble...?

**CyberLord**<br>
Hey a rare social commentary from the owner<br>
Usually they're either reports about how to hit on girls or promotion for his shop

**RamenBot**<br>
Wait a sec this is still a promotional post

**Pinevalley**<br>
I personally don't think that Xenon would do those things<br>
However, I have to say that with him getting off scot\-free every time and all those rumors out there<br>
It is no surprise that more and more people around me are starting to feel that there is something "off" about him

**Noposa**<br>
More and more fans are becoming haters

**RyanRii**<br>
Didn't expect NEKO to reply to this thread<br>
Is it wrong for me to be a little excited at the possibility of Cherry appearing as well (?

**lenba**<br>
Don't be stupid Cherry is under contract with an actual agency. It would be annoying\-AF for them to deal with a paparazzi magazine

**StuffyMouth**<br>
Owner don't be mad<br>
I'll go get a drink from you the day after tomorrow

**Pixely99**<br>
NEKO mostly rely on her fans online to make money. She really doesn't have to give a damn about reporters LMFAO

**maplewing**<br>
Why isn't it "King of Germs OUT"???
