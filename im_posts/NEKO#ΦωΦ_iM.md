**Arianaya**  
I thought it was canceled due to problems with the venue?

**EvilForce**  
No it wasn't canceled, the warm\-up performances did go through.

**w_Rosabel_w**  
Used to listen to his songs a lot.  
But deleted them all after he scammed everybodyヽ(\`Д´)ノ

**Smurky**  
Never heard of him. Is he famous?

**FCodex**  
Æsir and NEKO have completely different styles it's pointless to compare them.

**MirriLL**  
The songs are pretty nice, but I did not go to Æsir\-FEST

**Noposa**  
Agreed, songs are nice

**Talus_Alpha**  
It's because of the blackout right?

**Poopytrap**  
I get an urge to puke every time I think about it, anyone has the same problem? ：Q

**Zigzag**  
Is it so bad that you want to puke ROFL

**C_H_U**  
I attended it; I was completely fooled!!!!

**NekoSamurai**

### Requesting crowdfunding to buy Meowbots!
**NEKO#ΦωΦ**  
> ... One can imagine that in the future, AI will no longer be just a combination of random personalities. It can have its own identity and the ability to understand human nature. AI can assist humans in fields like social welfare, medical care and even more minor things like taking care of pets; all things that the existing AI can't do...

I'm ready to buy a dozen MeowBots \~\~\~

Besides doing chores and standing on the sweeping robots  
They can even help compose in the middle of the night, like little elves

Maybe I should let them handle the stream as well lulz

**MeowBat**  
LMFAO

**KirinKiraKira**  
Wait, if that's the case then what will you be doing XDD

**D33M0**  
A song compose by cat robots will likely only contain non\-stop purring lol

**Shibawu**  
If it really get 3600% faster then you can challenge **@ROBO\_Head** for the record of fastest time to compsoe a song lol

**ROBO_Head**  
Record: Composing time 6 mins and 24 secs this Unit fastest record. ：)

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**  
That's cheating!! (╬ΦдΦ)

**Talus_Alpha**  
It's the almighty ROBO\_Head!! If you call him, he will surely answer!!

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**  
Want to know which will be more popular: MeowBot or NEKO's stream

**Xenon**  
I fiddled with its prototype before. I say that it's nothing more than a decoration.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**  
S...shocked!! The Cool\-AF Xenon bought little kittens (Φ∀Φ) pffft

**Xenon**  
....It was a gift from a sponsor.

**NnNn**  
I will always support NEKO\#ΦωΦ <3<3

**MirriLL**  
I won't mind a 24/7 stream of a bunch of fluffy adorable kittens:)

**w_Rosabel_w**  
A cat stream will only feature them constantly pushing the camera around I think lol

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**  
It p\*\*\*\* me off so hard when I remember one of NEKO's compositions was taken by them GRRRRR(Φ皿Φ╬)!

**NEKOSAIKOU**  
Not surprised. Mono is a bunch of retarded A\-holes. Good thing NEKO is no longer under their contract

**Poopytrap**  
It's not the first time Mono is accused of plagiarism. They don't give a damn about copyright

**EvilForce**  
I've heard that even if you listen to NEKO's old songs, NEKO doesn't get a single penny. Everybody boycott that s\*\*\*!

**NekoSamurai**  
I've deleted anything related to Mono lol

**MirriLL**  
Did NEKO meet PAFF when you were still at Mono?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**  
Yeah, she's one arrogant b\*\*\*\*  
I was just trying to say hi to her, but I was completely blocked off by the guards (ΦдΦ)

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**  
One time I met her in the bathroom. NEKO said hello to her; she just turned and left!! Who does she think she is!

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**  
Another time we accidentally bumped into each other in the elevator; it's the agent who apologized to me((  ΦдΦ  ))

**Poopytrap**  
NEKO 's raging HARD <3 lolol

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**  
Is she speech\-impaired or what? During my time at Mono I never heard her say a single word (((  ΦдΦ  )))

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**  
I bet her singing voice is completely synthesized   
(((((     ΦдΦ      )))))

**w_Rosabel_w**  
There was a rumor that PAFF was only there for her looks; the singing is actually done by someone else lol

**KirinKiraKira**  
I've heard of ghost producer; there's ghost singer as well? ROFL

**loveIris**  
LMFAO

**TunaLee**  
My friend works at Mono as a cameraman. The story he heard was that PAFF had a car accident when she was young. The car accident erase all her childhood memory, causing her to become extremely introverted

**TunaLee**  
He said that it was a nightmare trying to take photos for her, as communication is literally impossible without her agent XDD

**EvilForce**  
So does she actually talk lol

**9me**  
Memory lost via car accident LOL

**D33M0**  
Isn't that Deemon8's story?

**9me**  
Man that's a shitty story lol

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**  
That story is a bunch of baloney. It exists only to manipulate the fans

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**  
NEKO's gonna play with MeowBot now (  ΦˋдˊΦ)=3 Hmpf

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**  
Legend has it that people who are online are in fact already dead for a while Σ Σ Σ (Φ ωΦlli )

**EvilForce**  
Not that uncommon nowadays isn't it?

**NekoSamurai**  
I have a friend who lives in Node03. He says that people often hit the streets at midnight and just randomly disappear

**D33M0**  
That's the admins' responsibility to deal with issues like this; not quite an urban legend lol

**FCodex**  
I've heard similar things lol

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**  
Exactly. But the real kicker is(ΦωΦ) before the body is found\~ his online self is still interacting with other people!!!

### \[Repost\] After half year hiatus, comeback from Aesir?
**NEKO#ΦωΦ**  
> ... Regarding Æsir, who disappeared half a year ago, countless questions were raised among fans. In addition, the news of his comeback came from a very mysterious source, adding more uncertainty to his return....

Not good news to read when I just woke up (╬ΦдΦ)  
No one will give a damn about his comeback if he didn't give an explanation (ΦωΦ)!

**Anom4ly**  
Does NEKO not know about PAFF's incident?

**NekoSamurai**  
Things are quite interesting at Mono right now lol

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**  
Eh? Nyani? WTF??? Smells like sweet, sweet gossip! (Φ皿Φ)

**9me**  
Someone's streaming on\-site right now\~ PMed you the link

A protest ( ΦдΦ)！?

**Smurky**  
Since PAFF is now officially missing, the cream Puffs finally exploded XDDD

**MRArupaka**  
Most of the complaints are about Mono's handling of the incident. They were treating everybody like morons

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**  
Hoho\~ so even PAFF is finally fed up with that s\*\*\*\*hole of a company? Nice choice(Φ∀Φ)b

**beeeeeeeeee**  
Nice choice wwwwww

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**  
Well\~ As ya all know, big companies are all shady\-AF  
**\#NEKOIsAVictimToo**

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**  
TBH is she really missing though? Maybe it's just another publicity stunt\~：/

Feel like if something really did go wrong, they would have kept it down like they always used to\~ ：\\

**FCodex**  
Stealing Robohead's emoticon lol

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**  
If it's stealing we're talking about, then Mono is LEAGUES ahead of me (Φ∀Φ)σ(Φ∀Φ)σ

**xxScarlexx**  
Past issues were never reported 'cause they pressured the media, right? If you think about it that way, then even this incident is really fishy

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**  
NEKO is just making a random guess though, hohoho (ΦωΦ)

**K1ssK1tty**  
You have a good point!! Probably all a set\-up!!  
Using underground gangs and the media to take down your competition, how convenient

**66TAN66**  
Money really is everything I guess @@

**AngerFang**  
If that's really the truth, then even Helena is faking it? How disgusting

**AngryFan**  
I mean, is there a thing about Mono that's NOT disgusting??

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**  
Ehehehe\~ It's really just a random guess\~ no need for such crazy conspiracies ( ΦдΦ)

**Heart_Head**  
NEKO definitely has some more inside news to share XD

**NEKOLUV**

Light slate grey seems like a good choice. NEKO is considering!!

### Having some crappy luck recently
**Henry**  
Recently, whenever I post, 8 out of 10 posts will be corrupted  
Bet this is some Mercury retrograde crap  
In addition, any electronic equipment that has ever come in contact with me has a very high chance of breaking down
