Used to listen to his songs a lot.<br>
But deleted them all after he scammed everybodyヽ(`Д´)ノ

**Smurky**<br>
Never heard of him. Is he famous?

**FCodex**<br>
Æsir and NEKO have completely different styles it's pointless to compare them. 

**MirriLL**<br>
The songs are pretty nice, but I did not go to Æsir\-FEST

**Noposa**<br>
Agreed, songs are nice

**Talus_Alpha**<br>
It's because of the blackout right?

**Poopytrap**<br>
I get an urge to puke every time I think about it, anyone has the same problem? ：Q

**Zigzag**<br>
Is it so bad that you want to puke ROFL

**C_H_U**<br>
I attended it; I was completely fooled!!!!

Besides doing chores and standing on the sweeping robots<br>
They can even help compose in the middle of the night, like little elves <br>
( Φ∀Φ)人(Φ∀Φ )<br>
Maybe I should let them handle the stream as well lulz

**MeowBat**<br>
LMFAO

**KirinKiraKira**<br>
Wait, if that's the case then what will you be doing XDD

**D33M0**<br>
A song compose by cat robots will likely only contain non\-stop purring lol 

**Shibawu**<br>
If it really get 3600% faster then you can challenge **@ROBO\_Head** for the record of fastest time to compsoe a song lol

**ROBO_Head**<br>
Record: Composing time 6 mins and 24 secs this Unit fastest record. ：)

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
That's cheating!! (╬ΦдΦ)

**Talus_Alpha**<br>
It's the almighty ROBO\_Head!! If you call him, he will surely answer!!

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Want to know which will be more popular: MeowBot or NEKO's stream <br>

I fiddled with its prototype before. I say that it's nothing more than a decoration. 

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
S...shocked!! The Cool\-AF Xenon bought little kittens (Φ∀Φ) pffft

**Xenon**<br>
....It was a gift from a sponsor.

I will always support NEKO\#ΦωΦ <3<3

**MirriLL**<br>
I won't mind a 24/7 stream of a bunch of fluffy adorable kittens:)

**w_Rosabel_w**<br>

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
It p\*\*\*\* me off so hard when I remember one of NEKO's compositions was taken by them GRRRRR(Φ皿Φ╬)!

**NEKOSAIKOU**<br>
Not surprised. Mono is a bunch of retarded A\-holes. Good thing NEKO is no longer under their contract

**Poopytrap**<br>
It's not the first time Mono is accused of plagiarism. They don't give a damn about copyright

**EvilForce**<br>
I've heard that even if you listen to NEKO's old songs, NEKO doesn't get a single penny. Everybody boycott that s\*\*\*!

**NekoSamurai**<br>
I've deleted anything related to Mono lol

**MirriLL**<br>
Did NEKO meet PAFF when you were still at Mono?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Yeah, she's one arrogant b\*\*\*\*<br>
I was just trying to say hi to her, but I was completely blocked off by the guards (ΦдΦ)

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
One time I met her in the bathroom. NEKO said hello to her; she just turned and left!! Who does she think she is!

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Another time we accidentally bumped into each other in the elevator; it's the agent who apologized to me((  ΦдΦ  ))

**Poopytrap**<br>
NEKO 's raging HARD <3 lolol

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Is she speech\-impaired or what? During my time at Mono I never heard her say a single word (((  ΦдΦ  )))

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
I bet her singing voice is completely synthesized <br>
((((( ΦдΦ )))))

**w_Rosabel_w**<br>
There was a rumor that PAFF was only there for her looks; the singing is actually done by someone else lol

**KirinKiraKira**<br>
I've heard of ghost producer; there's ghost singer as well? ROFL

**loveIris**<br>
LMFAO

**TunaLee**<br>
My friend works at Mono as a cameraman. The story he heard was that PAFF had a car accident when she was young. The car accident erase all her childhood memory, causing her to become extremely introverted

**TunaLee**<br>
He said that it was a nightmare trying to take photos for her, as communication is literally impossible without her agent XDD

**EvilForce**<br>
So does she actually talk lol

**9me**<br>
Memory lost via car accident LOL

**D33M0**<br>
Isn't that Deemon8's story?

**9me**<br>
Man that's a shitty story lol

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
That story is a bunch of baloney. It exists only to manipulate the fans

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
NEKO's gonna play with MeowBot now (  ΦˋдˊΦ)=3 Hmpf

I have a friend who lives in Node03. He says that people often hit the streets at midnight and just randomly disappear

That's the admins' responsibility to deal with issues like this; not quite an urban legend lol

**Anom4ly**<br>
Does NEKO not know about PAFF's incident?

**NekoSamurai**<br>
Things are quite interesting at Mono right now lol

A protest ( ΦдΦ)！?

**Smurky**<br>
Since PAFF is now officially missing, the cream Puffs finally exploded XDDD

**MRArupaka**<br>
Most of the complaints are about Mono's handling of the incident. They were treating everybody like morons

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Hoho\~ so even PAFF is finally fed up with that s\*\*\*\*hole of a company? Nice choice(Φ∀Φ)b

**beeeeeeeeee**<br>

If it's stealing we're talking about, then Mono is LEAGUES ahead of me (Φ∀Φ)σ(Φ∀Φ)σ

**xxScarlexx**<br>
Past issues were never reported 'cause they pressured the media, right? If you think about it that way, then even this incident is really fishy

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
NEKO is just making a random guess though, hohoho (ΦωΦ)

**K1ssK1tty**<br>
You have a good point!! Probably all a set\-up!!<br>
Using underground gangs and the media to take down your competition, how convenient

If that's really the truth, then even Helena is faking it? How disgusting

**AngryFan**<br>
I mean, is there a thing about Mono that's NOT disgusting??

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
