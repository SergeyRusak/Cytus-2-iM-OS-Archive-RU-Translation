> Announced several days ago, the AI emotion training project has invited several senior scholars to participate in the research. One of the scholars is A.R.C.'s senior advisor and archaeologist Colin Neumann Jr., who is named the head of the project. <br>
> Dr. Neumann is perhaps more well known by his other name, ConneR. A renowned virtual composer on the internet, he is also an archaeologist with a deep knowledge regarding instruments of the past. <br>
> To fulfill the educational purpose of the project, Dr. Neumann will be posting regular updates of the project on the internet. Hopefully, everyone gets a sneak peek into the wonders of Artificial Intelligence research.

　Thank you. I hope to make good use of this opportunity to interact with A.R.C. I believe that I can be of great help in terms of archaeology and ancient documents. <br>
　My personal connections with A.R.C. can be traced back to six months ago. As of now, the cooperation experience has been fairly pleasant. Accepting this mission is mutually beneficial for both sides.

Doesn't Sensei constantly embarrass them in his papers? What's going on here? XD

Has A.R.C. finally acknowledge Sensei's superiority lol

A.R.C. would be nothing without Master Colin's papers

Seriously, all breakthroughs they had in the last few years happened because Sensei utterly destroyed their past "theories" XDD

Only A.R.C. can have a project that catches Sensei's eye. Other minor stuff is not within his interest lolol
