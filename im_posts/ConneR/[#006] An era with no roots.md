# An era with no roots
## Post

　This era, I believe is one that lost its roots.

　A variety of music, advanced mixing techniques, constant interactions and collaborations, yet has lost the ability to utilize and enjoy classical instruments, the basis of all music.  

　Even more helpless, is that the public has lost its praise and appreciation for the timelessness and beauty of classical music. Affected by the fancy mixing and vulgar lyrics, people now care more about the gossip of musicians rather than their actual music.

　Pains me greatly witnessing this.

Master Colin's speech many years ago affected me very much. I greatly appreciate Sensei's words till this day.

Agreed!<br>
Now I tend to stay away from lengthy connections<br>
I feel that things in real life are much more important

No need to discredit the present right? Isn't time always progressing forward

Sensei~ the era is different. Just today in the academy, I was really angered by the shallow values displayed by the children there. Such Ignorance!
