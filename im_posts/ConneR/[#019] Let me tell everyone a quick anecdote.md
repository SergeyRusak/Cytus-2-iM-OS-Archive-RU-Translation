# Let me tell everyone a quick anecdote

ConneR:<br>
　A gardener was tending to his flowerbed when he discovered a group of ants surrounding an apple that has fallen to the ground. Some ants wanted to start diving in to the delicious fruit right away, Some ants wanted to go back to their hive to bring more ants to carry the apple back. The two sides began to argue with each other. Meanwhile, a third group of ants was busy trying to resolve the conflict; all the while a fourth group of ants was attempting to come up with a solution that can satisfy everybody. 

　Have a guess; how did the gardener deal with this fallen apple? He didn't pick up the apple and throw it away. He also didn't wash away the ants with the water hose he was holding. All he did was stand up, and walk away. 

　Yeah, who cares.
