　Still a while before the information is publicized, but recently I accepted another advisor position. It's in a familiar field, though the unit is not one I particularly agree with. After several back-and-forth negotiations, I accepted the position since they are very sincere about it. Once the NDA is lifted I'll talk more about it.

Excited! Must be a pretty important unit to let Sensei say yes XDD

Not even a tiny hint, Sensei?

Non-disclosure agreement.

Advisor...sounds so mysterious

**DMO**<br>
Ahhhh right, the NDA. Which Node is that unit in?

**StuffyMouth**<br>
Don't tease us

**Bolt_Urx**<br>
Maybe it's THAT one

**Otis_Emik**<br>
Which one?

**Dogleg**<br>
As far as I know, only THAT one will need a professional of Sensei's caliber

Go ahead, make your guess.
