　Only those who are there on-site can really feel the sincerest moment. No data transfer delays, no post-production trickery; only a real performance presented directly to the audience by the performer.

　And I, perform only for myself.

A perfect concert. I was bawling my eyes out during the curtain call

**Brightswirls**<br>
Thank you Sensei for giving us such an unforgettable night

**NewFans**<br>
Hello Sir, I am an audience at tonight's concert. Never thought that music this powerful and emotional still exists. I was really touched.

**RaiKiyumi**<br>
A completely different feeling compared to pop music...

**Otis_Emik**<br>
After performing 8 instruments in a row, Sensei took the stage to conduct the final piece. That scene gave me goosebumps <3

**DMO**<br>
Hope we get to see more performances like this

**StuffyMouth**<br>
It's magnificent. Why is it that a great musician like Sensei doesn't get any mainstream love QQ

**GemFeather**<br>
Sensei, please hold a few more sessions!

**C.Y.**<br>
An unprecedented concert

**Elextron**<br>
May I ask where can I buy the instruments Sensei was performing with?

**Ewx_Data**<br>
Guy above me, those are Sensei's personal collection lul

**NeverHeardofIt**<br>
Never heard of ConneR, went because of curiosity. Well Sensei, today you officially have a new fan!!

**MissingSth**<br>
Is there a holo-recreation? QQ

**DiiR**<br>
Too bad Sensei insists on live performances only. It would be a blessing for us fans outside of Node08 if there are virtual seats available

**ConneR**<br>
Fellow music lovers, thank you for the appreciation. If you can enjoy classical music, you already have better taste than the majority of the public. In the future, I will bring my live performances to an even higher level for everyone to enjoy.

    My performances do not have virtual seats, nor are there holographic recreations. Please come to the concert in person and experience the music with your own ears.

To all the staff tonight, and the all-important performer, we offer you our highest respect \*bows\*

**Bolt_Urx**<br>
Sensei you are the best ! ! !

**CozyCaty**<br>
I can't wait for the next performance to be here!!!!
