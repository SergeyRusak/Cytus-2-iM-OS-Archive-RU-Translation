# The Saxophone
## Post

　Due to Node 13's unique historical background, it has quite the collection of well-preserved instruments. The Saxophone is the instrument that left me the strongest impression in the past five years.  In a bar where I regularly visit, there is this small band that does a live performance every night. Their Saxophonist's superb technique is certainly one of the reasons I kept coming back. 

　The Saxophone is an iconic part of Jazz music. Its extremely versatile and free tone allows different performers to give the music their unique twist. The music flows as if it has a soul of its own.

If it's possible I would love to live a life just like Sensei, immersing in such wonderful things for a long time

Applying a travel visa for Node13 is a pain in the neck; or else I would really want to visit

　If you like things like this, allow me to recommend JOEZ Café at Quadrant II. I can say that the owner there knows more about Jazz and good alcohol than anyone in the Node.

Got it! Thanks for the recommendation Dr. ConneR ＼(´▽｀)

I feel that Node13 is the perfect place to forget all the annoying stuff in live \*applying for cross-Node travel\*
