　In the documents discovered east of Node47, I saw an orchestral collection beginning with the letter "L". However, the sheets have been so damaged that it is indecipherable. 

　Music that wonderful once existed yet we have no way to listen to it now, what a pity.

After hearing Sensei's description, I kinda want to go back to that era

**RaiKiyumi**<br>
Is there really no possibility to recover it? Want to hear it~

Just collecting every single instrument and recreating the setting is already mission impossible...

**CozyCaty**<br>
Is there really no other way?

**DMO**<br>
That sucks

**C.Y.**<br>
Can any research organization recover it?

**Brightswirls**<br>
Nobody besides Sensei can do it I believe

**StuffyMouth**<br>
How about other Nodes?

Master Colin is our only hope
