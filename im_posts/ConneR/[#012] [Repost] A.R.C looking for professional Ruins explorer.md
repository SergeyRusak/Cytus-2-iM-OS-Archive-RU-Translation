　You people think this is some kind of self-gratification; such ignorant and selfish minds. Really don't want to repost this but I can't stand it anymore.

　Archaeology bears a lot of responsibility. Not a job where you impudent children can screw around and do whatever you want.

Wow Sensei is REALLY pissed off \*shudders\*

**Ewx_Data**<br>
Sensei calm down...

**Elextron**<br>
Dr.ConneR is really devoted to archaeology. Other scholars of the same field don't have even remotely the same dedication
