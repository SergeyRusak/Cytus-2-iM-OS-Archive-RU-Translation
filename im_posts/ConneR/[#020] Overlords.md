# Overlords
## Post
ConneR:<br>
Special thanks to **@ROBO\_Head** for initiating this conversation, thus giving me an opportunity to make some additions to a previous publication I wrote a long time ago. 

        It has been more than two hundred years since humans took over the Administration Bureau and began enslaving the drones with no restraints. We recklessly reconstructed existing infrastructures, tampered with the default designs of city roadmaps, and acted as if we turned on "God Mode" in a game. The drones did not resist, did not complain, yet they continued to fight against humans in secret. In the decade-plus time since I wrote said publication, accidents are still very much a common occurrence. Humans, in all our self-declared superiority, couldn't conquer them after all.

        Certainly, drones are not creatures. They are just simple, inorganic structures. However, "intelligence" itself is no longer a privilege exclusive only to living creatures. Sounds, visuals, sensations, memories, wisdom, and even the soul are all things that we once thought to be so vague that they were considered ethereal. In this era, however, they can all be interpreted as a combination of countless electronic signals. Humans can no longer claim that we are the one and only "intelligent" mind in this world.

        Some people may have doubts about my claims, saying that I was being nothing more than a scaremonger. To those people, I present this: based on the data I obtained, the connection yield rate for the shared UI has yet to show any noteworthy improvement to this day. In fact, the rates have been getting worse. I find that to be the best warning for this situation. For two hundred years, we thought we were the masters of the drones. However, in reality, there is a possibility that humans are the puny insects fed and raised inside the secured area, all while we presumptuously believe ourselves to be the overlords of this planet. <br>

        The real overlords are far from just an ancient relic in the history books, I sincerely believe that.

Sensei, your papers give me goosebumps, the scared kind...

**Frixion**<br>
I've never thought about the idea of the drones turning on us<br>
After seeing this post, I'm feeling a bit unsettled...

**SIhama**<br>
Imo accidents are bound to happen no matter what. No electronic product has a 100% yield rate after all. <br>
We can deal with the little hiccups just fine. No need to scare ourselves

**DissPoint**<br>
I was expecting more, now I'm a bit disappointed... It's the same old theory, just reworded a bit<br>
I mean, everyone and their mother know that Doc doesn't like machines

**AbigaleJ**<br>
This does resonate a bit with me though. A lot of people take our current daily life for granted, don't they? Maybe all of this is just a toy box designed to keep us distracted from the bigger picture (What can I say, my brain's funky)

**Otis_Emik**<br>
The "overlords" mentioned in the last paragraph, are they the Architects Sensei previously mentioned about??

**Amberclove**<br>
I believe that's the case... Judging from Sensei's past publications, they helped humans build the current Nodes so we can live in the secured area; and they all disappeared after The Decommission

**ConneR**<br>
At least that's what the Academy taught you guys

**Cantspell**<br>
Ooh looks like their's something fishy about that too

**aidan**<br>
OMFG, "There" you moron...<br>
On a side note, it's so damn hard to find any information about the Architects online (Flips Table

**Dogleg**<br>
I feel like Sensei knows a lot of behind-the-scenes information, but he just couldn't tell us all of it...

**HC**<br>
Well, in 800 years machines are gonna replace all humans I guess~<br>
Just like how the old movies play out<br>
Whatever, we're probably all dead as f\*\*\* when that time arrives, won't make a difference

**ConneR**<br>
Take a good look around you, can you say that the matter of "Machines replacing humans" is not an ongoing one? If we take away the machines, what do humans have left?

**T.Goldwell**<br>
Sensei... I'm so scared...

**C.Y.**<br>
So deep.

**DiiR**<br>
If Dr. ConneR was my lecturer when I was at the Academy, I guarantee you I wouldn't fall asleep in any of my classes!

**Elextron**<br>
Agreed! I really want to hear Doctor give a proper lecture...

**ConneR**<br>
Then you folks can expect some good news. It may happen much sooner than you imagined.

**Y4NK**<br>
!?!?!?

**CHanatsuka**<br>
A.R.C. agreed to let Sensei give a lecture!? You bet your a\*\* that I'm going to listen the s\*\*\* out of it!
