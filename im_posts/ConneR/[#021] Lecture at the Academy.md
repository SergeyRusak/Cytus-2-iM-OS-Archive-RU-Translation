# Lecture at the Academy
## Post
ConneR:<br>
I hinted about this a while ago. Today, I'm here to make an official announcement.

    Because of an invitation from A.R.C., I will be giving lectures at the Academy in my spare time of heading the research project. The topics will be the correct attitude and mental fortitude for archeological excavation. I will also mention my new viewpoints on researches about ancient civilizations. Since it's in the Academy, I won't delve into overly minute details. Nevertheless, I will reveal many unimaginable things that you won't believe exists. You don't want to miss it.

    This series of lectures will be available to the public. Anyone can sit in on them. However, I truly hope that there will be other intellectuals present to have a proper discussion with me.

Don't think there will be many in this Node who is qualified to have a "proper" discussion with Sensei XDD

Man, how lazy can you be?<br>
Those who are slothful do not have the right to pursue the truth (In Sensei's tone)

Extra note here. A.R.C. originally provided me with a pre-determined handout. They wanted me to give my lecture according to that handout. That file was categorized as spam by my firewall program and deleted alongside other malicious emails. Therefore, I will be using my own material to give the lecture.

    In addition, please don't bring any mobile devices or recording equipment to my lectures. I will not prepare any visual aid or handouts for my presentation either. What I'm going to tell you requires no notes; all you need are your ears to hear me talk and your heart to feel my words. I guarantee that you will gain a lot by simply doing what I said.

The website experienced so much traffic that it's starting to lag... Must be quite the shocker for the Academy

Thank you to Dr. ConneR for the announcement! Personally, I've been following the public reports of ARC's exploration team for a long time. I have some questions I would like to ask doctor. Can I occupy your time after the lecture ends? I would like to exchange some ideas I had about the recent exploration results.

**ConneR**<br>
Welcome.

Thank you so much! I look forward to meeting you!
