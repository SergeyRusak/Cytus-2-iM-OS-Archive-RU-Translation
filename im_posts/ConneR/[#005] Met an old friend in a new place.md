　In terms of artistic attainment, I know my place. I don't consider myself to be knowledgeable by any means. Knowledge is endless, and there is only so much a mere human can obtain throughout a single lifetime. 

　Today, through the introduction of a mutual friend, I had a thorough exchange with the scholar of the new generation **@ROBO\_Head**. I was very impressed with his wide array of knowledge. It feels good to meet an old friend in a new place.

**@ConneR** Doctor's research in instruments, classical music and ancient civilizations, worthy for this Unit to learn. ：D

　You are welcome.<br>
　I believe that I can also learn a lot from you. I look forward to interacting with you more.

Dedicated to classical music yet willing to accept new things. I expect no less from Dr. ConneR

All in the name of art, I admire that. 

**ConneR**<br>
I'm flattered.

Such detailed research from Dogleg. Indeed ConneR Sensei's loyal fan.
