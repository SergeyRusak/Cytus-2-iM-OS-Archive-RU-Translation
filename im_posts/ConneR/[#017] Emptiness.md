# Emptiness

ConneR:<br>
People of the modern age seem to be overly focused on pursuing the shallow surface. They often only care about what they see, or more likely, what they want to see. Never once did they think about the context and reasons beneath the surface.

    My music is also a rebellion against such oblivious actions. Therefore that's the reason why you can only see me perform in-person.

Is Sensei taking a shot at the recent incidents?

**RaiKiyumi**<br>
Which incident?<br>
There's like fifty of them these days...

Does Sensei already have plans for the next concert?

**DMO**<br>
More sessions of the same concert obviously, he's touring ya know. You don't plan a new concert after just a single session

I am sick and tired of hearing PAFF and NEKO fanboys/girls whine about nonsense

**C.Y.**<br>
It baffles me to this day that these two girls somehow became the eye of the storm for these events

**Cybel_Mach**<br>
Doctor, do you have any idea??

**Flower_Head**<br>
Xenon, who works at A.R.C., has been tag spammed for weeks now XD

**Ayx_Socket**<br>
Does ConneR know Xenon? Maybe you guys meet quite often?

**AbigaleJ**<br>
I don't get Æsir's intentions. Like what benefit does he get by erasing the memories??
