　Recently the condition of my prosthetic arm has been god awful, to say the least. Makes me wonder if I accidentally ordered a leg instead of an arm; that or they actually sold me some junk scraped from the morgue.

　Gradually getting used to this non-organic arm, but when awoken in the middle of the night by an unstable nerve shock, I still get a nauseous feeling. Is this the compensation for modern technology?

　Can't compose nor perform normally under such conditions. How can I recommend music of such underwhelming quality to my friends?

　I am very busy with my work and my research. Do you really think that I have the time to mail it back to the OEM and wait seven to eight days for a repair?

Sensei got an electronic arm!? What happened??

**DMO**<br>
For performing purposes?

**ConneR**<br>
　No, had a minor accident while away from Node08. I would not install this disgusting piece of junk for performing purposes.

That's outrageous! Which brand is it?

Sensei has very high standards!

**ConneR**<br>
I'll be waiting.

**BodyHack Service**<br>
Yes Sir!

Wasn't BH a pretty good brand? What's with the flop?

They recently had a complete management change; must still be dealing with the aftershock
