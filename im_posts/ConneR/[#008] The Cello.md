# The Cello

　The first assembled acoustic instrument to be discovered is an ancient instrument known as the 'Cello". Perhaps due to its large size, it's preserved in a relatively good condition. It's discovered in a concert hall ruins near Node 13. It was buried 45 meters deep and was detected by an unmanned drone. 

　With modern technology, they are many ways to simulate a good low-pitch string instrument. However, the Cello, which is created with top quality lumber and delicate crafts, can give out a very clear and deep tone. 

　A bit sad, yet extremely mesmerizing. This instrument provides a steadiness that makes even the piano, a one-piece chord instrument, feel inferior.

I heard it when I was visiting Node13. It's a low but melodious tune. I really like it :)
