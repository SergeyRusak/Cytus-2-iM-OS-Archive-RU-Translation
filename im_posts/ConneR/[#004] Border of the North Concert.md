# Border of the North Concert

　I guess a promotion here wouldn't hurt. My next concert, as usual, will be held at Central Music Hall at Quadrant I. The performance this time will feature classical works of Northen musicians the likes of Rachmaninoff and Stravinsky.

　Of course, my newest work will also be featured. Don't miss out on it.

Impudent child! Sensei's concert requires no promotion! Tickets are extremely hard to come by!

Only Central Music Hall can bring out the characteristics of ConneR Sensei's music.

Did some research?

Central Music Hall can hold almost 2000 people. Reverberation is controlled between 1.85 ~1.9 seconds. A crowned jewel among performance venues.

Four floors of seats and boxes, with luxurious curtains and a relief sculpture wall.

TBH, people who listen to live performances have dropped off quite a bit.
