## WARNING
**IF YOU DON'T WANT TO GET SPOILED, GO READ ALL THE FREE OS LOGS FIRST**.  
Okay now that you read that, don't get mad at me for reading more and
getting spoiled.

## Requirements
|   Char.   |Lv.|Lv. Locked?|
|-----------|:-:|:---------:|
|**Vanessa**|24 |    No     |

There are **three** endings for Cytus 2, and it all depends on what actions
you take on the final boss against Vanessa after Ivy's death, that is,
[this OS log](./os_logs/Vanessa_OS.md#os-log-037). After getting either
**Good**/**Neutral** endings, you can change your ending by selecting the
boss battle in the **Backup Database**.

## Good Ending
To trigger the good ending, before battling against Vanessa, respond to
PAFF's call by tapping any note in the cutscene. Tap the note at the end of
the battle as well. Afterwards, you can unlock **The Whole Rest** by reading
[this iM post](./im_posts/Other_iM.md#im-post-145).

You can watch the video of the good ending [here](https://youtu.be/XCF7z41jcn4).

## Neutral Ending
To trigger the neutral ending, before battling against Vanessa, don't respond to
PAFF's call, but tap the note at the end of the battle. Afterwards, you can unlock
**Used to be** by reading [this iM post](./im_posts/Other_iM.md#im-post-150)

You can watch the video of the neutral ending [here](https://youtu.be/4ijHIlPNSGo).

## Bad Ending
To trigger the bad ending, do **not** tap the note at the end of the battle, it
doesn't matter whether you tapped the note on PAFF's call. Attempting to select
any character will just show a ruined version of the character's background,
except for Vanessa, who will give you a choice to change your ending.

You can watch the video of the bad ending [here](https://youtu.be/_c0Cf_zOwBc).

### Easter Egg
If you want an easter egg, **do not skip the credits in this ending**.
During the credits, tap the missing letters (in **bold**) of the names
in the respective sections:
