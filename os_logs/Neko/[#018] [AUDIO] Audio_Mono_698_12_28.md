**Neko**<br>
Morning\~ Hello everyone, NEKO is here!

**Chris**<br>
Umm, you're almost ten minutes late... Also, it's already the afternoon, not morning.

**Neko**<br>
You're so noisy. PAFF is not here either.<br>
We're discussing the arrangements with her today, right? I'm so excited\~

**Chris**<br>
About that, A... Miss PAFF will not be coming today.

**Neko**<br>
Not coming!? WHY??

**Chris**<br>
She had a schedule conflict... Wait, didn't I mention this on the notification?<br>
Let me introduce to you. This is sis Helena. She'll be discussing the details about this arrangement collaboration with you.

**Helena**<br>
Nice to meet you, Miss Asakura. I'm Helena Black. I'm PAFF's agent.

**Neko**<br>
Ah, greetings! You don't have to refer to NEKO by my last name. You can just call me NEKO!<br>
Waaaa, my first time seeing a real agent! You're so beautiful!

**Chris**<br>
Eh, so I don't count...?

**Helena**<br>
... Haha, hello NEKO.<br>
Apologies, PAFF has a filming scheduled today, so she couldn't come. Later today I'll have her write you a mail to say hello to you.

**Neko**<br>
No problem, no problem! Wow, super idol indeed! I'm more and more excited about this collab!<br>
Sis Helena, if we have the opportunity, can I meet her? The real PAFF must be so sweet and tasty. Slurp\~ Muhaha\~

**Chris**<br>
Why does that sound a bit dangerous...

**Helena**<br>
Haha, that is certainly doable.<br>
Then, regarding this collaboration, I would like to know more about NEKO's creative style and methods...

**Neko**<br>
No problemo! NEKO brought a lot of unannounced DEMOs today. Enought for a whole album collab!

**Helena**<br>
Good to hear that. Let's start our discussion right away. Here, take a seat.

**Neko**<br>
Sure! Thank you, sis Helena!

**Chris**<br>
Ummm... what about me?

**Helena**<br>
Get two coffees from the beverage counter.<br>
I'll have the usual, double Espresso, black.

**Neko**<br>
NEKO want a ice caramel macchiato, light ice. No mixing though, or you drink it yourself.

**Chris**<br>
......<br>
OK......
