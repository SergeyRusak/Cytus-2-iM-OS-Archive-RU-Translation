**Yukiko**<br>
NEKO, welcome back.

**Neko**<br>
... Oh.

*\[Cutting Vegetables\]*

**Yukiko**<br>
Ah, you're eating at home tonight, right? We'll be living together from now on. I... I want to prepare a hearty dinner to show my appreciation.

**Neko**<br>
Oh... I see.

**Yukiko**<br>

*\[Door Knock\]*

**Kouhei**<br>
NEKO, time for dinner.<br>
Yukiko made your favorite dish.

**Neko**<br>
NEKO... will be there in just a minute.

**Kouhei**<br>
Okay. We'll wait for you, then we can start.

**Neko**<br>
......

*\[Slaps face\]*

**Neko**<br>
... Sis Yukiko is a good person... It'll be alright... Just act normally...

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

**Kenta**<br>
Ah, big sister, it's time to eat!

**Neko**<br>
I'm coming. Sorry for making you guys wait...

**Kouhei**<br>
?<br>
What's wrong? Take a seat.

**Neko**<br>
...... What is this?

**Yukiko**<br>
Ah, I want to try making the meat stew... I heard that this is your favorite dish, so I want to see if I can recreate that flavor... However, I'm not very good with sauces. The taste just doesn't feel right... Can you help me taste\-test it?

**Neko**<br>
... Sis Yukiko... How did you know about the meat stew?

**Yukiko**<br>
Eh? Why did you ask this all of a sudden...

**Neko**<br>
How did you know?

**Yukiko**<br>
Ummm, let me think... It was quite a while ago. Your father brought this huge pot of meat stew to share with us. He said he made it himself... Since it was really delicious, I asked him for the recipe...

**Neko**<br>
... Daddy, you took the meat stew NEKO help cooked...

**Kouhei**<br>
Ah... Because the ones I made are just inedible...

**Neko**<br>
That's mommy's recipe! How can you just give it away to some random stranger!?

**Yukiko**<br>
... Stranger...

**Kouhei**<br>
N, NEKO?

**Neko**<br>
Mommy's meat stew... it... it's the only way NEKO can still be connected to mommy... *\*Sniff\*...*

**Neko**<br>
You...... you...... Who gave you the right to cook this dish!?

**Yukiko**<br>
......!!

*\[Slams the table\]*

**Kouhei**<br>
NEKO! Yukiko made this for you out of goodwill! Apologize to her now...

**Neko**<br>
NEKO's not eating that!

*\[Hurried Footsteps\]*

**Kouhei**<br>
NEKO! Where are you going? Get back here!

*\[Slams door\]*

**Kouhei**<br>
......

**Kenta**<br>
Uwaaaaaa... big sister is mad...

**Yukiko**<br>
It's alright, Kenta, it will be alright... Kouhei, you should calm down too. I'm the one to blame. I didn't know this dish meant so much to her... *\*Sobs\*... \*Cries\*...*

**Kouhei**<br>
...... Yukiko......
