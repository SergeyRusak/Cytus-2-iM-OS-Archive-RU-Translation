*\[Door Opens\]*

**Neko**<br>
Mommy! Grandma! NEKO is back~

**Mayu**<br>
Wow~ NEKO, is that you!?

**Saku**<br>
NEKO!? What did you come back all of a sudden!?

**Neko**<br>
Hehe~ I bought the ticket the moment I saved up enough money! I want to give you two a big surprise!

**Saku**<br>
You child... how could you not tell us that you're coming back!<br>
Mommy will go clear out your room now.

**Neko**<br>
Eh~ You don't need to do that. NEKO will be going back the day after tomorrow. I still have work to do.

**Saku**<br>
We're just about to eat dinner. Need to cook your share now.

**Neko**<br>
......

**Saku**<br>
What's wrong? Why are you standing still at the door? Go wash your hands.

**Neko**<br>
*... \*Cries\**... Uwaaaaaa~ Mommy! Grandma! NEKO miss you so much!

**Neko**<br>
... Then NEKO kicked him in the balls and yelled, "Who you calling midget!?". Then got yanked outside! Then I got saved by this random weird person!

**Mayu**<br>
That sounds so dangerous...

**Saku**<br>
You're still doing things this recklessly?

**Neko**<br>
No need to worry, NEKO is strong! Daddy was always mumbling about Node 08 being better. NEKO don't see how it's better? There are still weird people everywhere!

**Saku**<br>
Haha...

*\[Collecting dishes\]*

**Saku**<br>
Ah, mom, let me wash it.

**Neko**<br>
Eh, let NEKO do it~

**Mayu**<br>
It's alright~ Mother and daughter should spend more time together after being apart for so long. Besides, the doctor has suggested that I should exercise more often.

**Neko**<br>
Thanks, grandma~

**Saku**<br>
NEKO, why did you have the time to come back? What about the Academy?

**Neko**<br>
Ah... I've been taking a break from that. NEKO is working part\-time and renting a house outside right now... Ah! NEKO is a music arranger for Monophonic Entertainment now! Mommy, have you heard of PAFF? NEKO arranged songs for her! Pretty good, right?

**Saku**<br>
I knew that. Your dad told me about it.

**Neko**<br>
Eh......?

**Saku**<br>
Honestly... you can't just leave the Academy like that.

**Neko**<br>
Daddy... still keeps in contact with mommy? NEKO thought... So mommy also knew about sis Yukiko...?

**Saku**<br>
I do.

**Neko**<br>
Mommy... are you okay with this? Daddy is such a big liar. Back then he said it was all about work and environment... NEKO was even worried about him being lonely... He also stopped sending money back, right?

**Saku**<br>
Yes, he no longer does that. He has a new family now; mommy doesn't want to take money from him anymore.<br>
We're doing fine on our own. No need to worry about us~

**Neko**<br>
Eheh!? Mommy, you're too nice! Why aren't you angry at daddy for

**Saku**<br>
NEKO, do you think that daddy has changed?

**Neko**<br>
Eh...? I don't know...

**Saku**<br>
Personally, I feel like he hasn't changed one bit. He is still that headstrong, careless blockhead who wants to shoulder everything. Am I correct?

**Neko**<br>
... Yes...

**Saku**<br>
Mommy has known him ever since we were both students. Back then, he actually had feelings for me already. Despite that, he waited until we were both adults before he confessed to me in a really sloppy manner...<br>
He has no idea how anxious I was waiting for him.

**Neko**<br>
I can totally imagine that...

**Saku**<br>
NEKO, people don't change that easily. At the very least, the daddy I knew won't change that easily. In our lives, we will meet all kinds of different people. Every single person is worthy for us to give, to love, to care. However, there is only so much one person can give. We can only choose what we feel like is the best on the spot, and not regret the things we give afterward. 

**Neko**<br>
Hmm... NEKO don't really understand...

**Saku**<br>
*\*Chuckles\**~ Simply put, just keep one thing in mind. Whether it's daddy or mommy, our love for you will never change; because no matter what happens, you are the one person that is most worthy of our devotion.

**Neko**<br>
......

**Saku**<br>
NEKO, what do you think about that Yukiko person?

**Neko**<br>
Well... it pains me a little to say this, but she and mommy... are a bit similar, I think? You're both beautiful, gentle, mindful... really good at cooking, although not as good as mommy...<br>
She's also very kind to NEKO...

**Saku**<br>
Then it should be fine.

**Neko**<br>
But NEKO still can't quite accept it... I don't know how to face them.

**Saku**<br>
Make the decision yourself, just like when you're little. Remember that? If you want to come back to Node 03, you can do so at any time. Daddy will also understand your decision.

**Neko**<br>
NEKO... still needs to think about it. It's a lot of fun making music there, and I made a lot of good friends...

**Saku**<br>
All in all, this will always be your home. Mommy will help you keep your room shiny and spotless.

**Neko**<br>
Hmm... Thank you, mommy.
