**Neko**<br>
Are you sure that you can't...?

**[Linda]**<br>
*Sorry... I really can't help you out today...*

**Neko**<br>
Ah~~ Not just today. NEKO might be without a place to live from now on...

**[Linda]**<br>
*Eh? What happened?*

**Neko**<br>
Got kicked out by daddy... No, NEKO ran away.

**[Linda]**<br>
*What!? Why!?*

**Neko**<br>
Well... all in all, NEKO will figure out a way. Thanks.

**[Linda]**<br>
*The more I hear, the more concerned I get! Where are you now? The Game Center?*

**Neko**<br>
Uh\-huh... Don't worry about it! NEKO will be alright!

**[Linda]**<br>
*Linda! Are you on the phone with NEKO? Her family just called; where is she now?*

**Neko**<br>
Wah! Is that your mom? Don't tell them where NEKO is no matter what! That's it! Bye\-bye!

**[Linda]**<br>
*Ah, wa...*

*[Call Ends]*

**Neko**<br>
... What should I do now? The rain is pouring... so I can't go outside either.<br>
Forget about it. Guess I'll play a few rounds first...

**[Arcade Shooter]**<br>
*Player NEKO\#ΦωΦ WIN! NEW RECORD!*

**Neko**<br>
Yeah! Another new record!

**Xenon**<br>
...... Hey.

**Neko**<br>
... Xenon!? Why are you here?

**Xenon**<br>
Isn't that my question? Do you realize what time it is?

**Neko**<br>
......

**Xenon**<br>
Have you forgotten what I told you before? Go home.

**Neko**<br>
...... No.

**Xenon**<br>
... I'm not messing with you. The drones' patrol routes will reach here later. If you're still here by that time, things are going to get messy.

**Neko**<br>
*... \*Choking up\*...*

**Xenon**<br>
Ummm... Are you crying?

**Neko**<br>
ARGHHHH!! Let's have a match right now!

**Xenon**<br>
... Ha?

**Neko**<br>
A match with this! If you beat NEKO, NEKO will go home! If NEKO wins, you leave me alone and let me do whatever I want!

**Xenon**<br>
Hey, enough is en...

**Neko**<br>
Are you scared!?

**Xenon**<br>
... Fine, just one.

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

**[Arcade Shooter]**<br>
*Player NEKO\#ΦωΦ WIN! NEW RECORD!*

**Neko**<br>
NOICE!

**Xenon**<br>
... Seriously? So you're the "NEKO\#ΦωΦ" on this high\-score ranking?

**Neko**<br>
Hmph~ How is it? NEKO won!

**Xenon**<br>
Yeah... I lost.

**Neko**<br>
Therefore......<br>
... le, let NEKO go to your home!

**Xenon**<br>
...... Haa??

**Neko**<br>
Xenon lives alone, right?

**Xenon**<br>
... Do you know what you're talking about? My place is a workshop. It doesn't even have a place for you to sleep.

**Neko**<br>
NEKO doesn't want to go home. The rain is pouring outside; are you planning to leave NEKO here all by myself?

**Xenon**<br>
Hey, I'm serious about...

**Neko**<br>
... T, the one who won was NEKO, right?

**Xenon**<br>
......

**Neko**<br>
The drones' patrol routes will reach here later, right?

**Xenon**<br>
......
