**Kouhei**<br>
Judging by their frightened faces... They probably wouldn't dare to bother us anymore from now on.<br>
What exactly is this "X" thing your friend told you about? The bad guys seem terrified of it...

**Neko**<br>
NEKO don't really know the details too, but it seems to work quite well...

**Kouhei**<br>
Daddy had some serious misjudgments about your friends. NEKO has some pretty amazing friends...

**Neko**<br>
Yeah... By the way! What were you thinking rushing in there without earbuds! And you pressed the wrong button! NEKO was super nervous during all that!

**Kouhei**<br>
Sorry... Because I want to spew some pretty cringy lines...

**Neko**<br>
Eh...? Even without earbuds, NEKO can still see you on\-screen. I can hear all the sounds as well.

**Kouhei**<br>
EH!? For real? Man, so you heard them all? God, that was so embarrassing...

**Neko**<br>
Not at all... Rather, I feel like... daddy was kinda cool back there.

**Kouhei**<br>
......

**Neko**<br>
B\-U\-T! If it's NEKO posing as X, it would be at least ten times cooler! It will definitely look better than that sloppy performance you put out there!

**Kouhei**<br>
Haha, that was already my best shot. Cut me some slack...

**Neko**<br>
AH! Daddy, your head is still bleeding! Quick, we have to get you to the hospital!

**Kouhei**<br>
No big deal; it's just a small scratch... Compare to that, there's a more important place we must be at right now. If we don't hurry, we're not going to make it.

**Neko**<br>
...... Ha?

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

**Neko**<br>
Nah! Aren't we almost home? Is it really ok for you to not go to the hospital!?<br>
You said something about going to a more important place... then you just grabbed this box. What's inside?

**Kouhei**<br>
No need to panic. You'll know very soon.

**Yukiko**<br>
Kouhei! NEKO!

**Kouhei**<br>
NEKO, bring the box over here.<br>
Open it.

**Neko**<br>
Huh......? Eh? Cake!?

**Kouhei**<br>
Today is your birthday, right? We've only got half\-an\-hour left. Let's celebrate!

**Neko**<br>
......

**Yukiko**<br>
Happy birthday, NEKO!

**Kenta**<br>
Big sister, Happy birthday!

**Neko**<br>

**Kouhei**<br>
This is also daddy's apology to you. I'm sorry for the terrible things I said to you...

**Neko**<br>
......

**Yukiko**<br>
NEKO, I have to apologize to you too. It was me who interfered with this family... <br>
I didn't consider your feelings. On top of that, I dragged both of you into my troubles...

**Neko**<br>
......

**Yukiko**<br>
You've already made your decision... about going back to Node 03, right?

**Kouhei**<br>
......

**Neko**<br>
Yeah... That day, NEKO came back just to grab some stuff before I leave. Somehow, I got involved with this incident...

**Yukiko**<br>
It's a shame that we couldn't live together with you. However, we will always keep your room for you.

**Neko**<br>
Come on... Sis Yukiko, if you put it that way, there's no way NEKO can leave...

**Yukiko**<br>
......Eh?

**Neko**<br>
NEKO has decided! I am not leaving! I'm moving back in! Daddy, you're okay with this, right?

**Kouhei**<br>
......Eh? Of course I'm okay with it!

**Neko**<br>
This household is so weak; what are you guys gonna do without NEKO!?<br>
One parent gets knocked out cold with one blow! The other is always on business trips and is never home! Who's going to protect Kenta then? Right?

**Kenta**<br>
Big sister...

**Neko**<br>
NEKO also promise... that I will not make you guys worry anymore. I'm sorry...

**Yukiko**<br>
NEKO... Thank you! Thank you so much! *\*Sobs\*......*

**Neko**<br>
*...\*Sniffs\*... *Alright! That's enough crying! It's a bad omen to cry on someone else's birthday party! Let's blow out the candles!
