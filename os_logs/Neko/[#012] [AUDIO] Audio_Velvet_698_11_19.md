**[Xenon-V]**<br>
*That's it for tonight's performance! Thank you for coming!*

*\[Audience cheers\]*

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

**Linda**<br>
Xenon was so cool! That performance was so good!

**Neko**<br>
No kidding\~

**Linda**<br>
Ah, the bus service is almost ending. We better get moving.

**Neko**<br>
Ummm... NEKO wants to stay here a bit longer. Linda\-chan, you can go back first.

**Linda**<br>
Eh? This place will become a bar very soon...

**Neko**<br>
NEKO will leave before 12:00 am, so no need to worry\~

**Linda**<br>
Alright... be careful yourself. If you wander around outside past midnight, drones and law enforcement agents will start to harass you.

**Neko**<br>
I know, I know\~

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

**Xenon**<br>
Hi, milk.

**Bartender**<br>
Gotcha.

**Neko**<br>
Hellloo! Mister pervert!

**Xenon**<br>
... You again?

**Neko**<br>
What? Why the distasteful look!

**Xenon**<br>
... Because every time I run into you, I get caught up in some random crap.<br>
What are you doing here at this time? Aren't you afraid of being caught?

**Neko**<br>
NEKO was here to see you perform!

**Xenon**<br>
...... Eh?

**Neko**<br>
You're Xenon, right? On top of that! You were also Simon from CP! NEKO knew it! No wonder your face seemed so familiar!

**Xenon**<br>
......

**Bartender**<br>
Haha, getting recognized by fans again? Told ya; with that long hair of yours, the helmet won't do a thing.

**Xenon**<br>
Shut up... so what if I am? It's not like I'm going out of my way to hide this information.

**Neko**<br>
WOW! Right on the money! This is not public knowledge yet, isn't it? That Simon is Xenon! This is big news!

**Xenon**<br>
It's not that big of a reveal... Also, keep your voice down...

**Neko**<br>
Why didn't you just continue using the name "Simon"? Your music will be so much more popular! Right now, your popularity is not even half of what CP used to have.

**Xenon**<br>
... CP has already disbanded. The public has too many imaginations about it that are not related to music. I want a complete restart; a simple focus on music alone. That's all.

**Bartender**<br>
This bulls\*\*\* reasoning again...

**Neko**<br>
He\~? Is this the reason behind the disbandment?

**Bartender**<br>
Haha... Little girl, just give up. He's not gonna talk.

**Neko**<br>
Who you calling little girl!? NEKO is already 16!

**Xenon**<br>
... On a side note, that cat last time, what happened afterward?

**Neko**<br>
Ah, it's still in NEKO's room... But NEKO's house doesn't have a pet registration, and there's someone who's allergic to cats... Right now, I'm pretty much just raising it in secret. So troublesome\~\~\~

**Xenon**<br>
... I do know someone who might be able to adopt it, but that dude already has a dog...

**Neko**<br>
Really!? Can you please ask him?

**Xenon**<br>
Alright. I'll ask.

**Neko**<br>
You're my savior\~ Or else NEKO's gonna get busted by my family anytime soon...<br>
Let's exchange iM so we can better communicate with each other!

**Xenon**<br>
Sure.

*\[iM exchange\]*

**Neko**<br>
Yeah\~ Xenon's iM get!

**Xenon**<br>
... Don't send it to some random stranger.

**Neko**<br>
No worries, I won't! NEKO is very good at keeping secrets\~ Oh, and NEKO won't spill the secret that Xenon is Simon as well!

**Xenon**<br>
Aren't you spilling it right now...?
