**Kouhei**<br>
NEKO, wake up. It's two in the aftenoon already. You're going to meld with the bed at this point.

**Neko**<br>
Mmmm...Hmm? What? Today's a weekend... I still wanna sleep...

**Kouhei**<br>
No. There's something I need you to help with. Quick, wake up.<br>
Kenta, come here.

*\[Footsteps\]*

**Neko**<br>
......?<br>
Eh...? What is this all about?

**Kouhei**<br>
You've met him before, right? This is Yukiko's son, Kenta. Daddy need to visit the company offices with Yukiko to deal with some things. Can you take care of him for a short while?

**Kenta**<br>
......

**Kouhei**<br>
Kenta, this is big sister NEKO. You'll stay with her for the afternoon. We'll come back very soon, got it?

**Kenta**<br>
... (Nods)

**Neko**<br>
... NEKO haven't agreed to this, have I?

**Kouhei**<br>
NEKO, don't say that.

**Neko**<br>
These days, daddy and sis Yukiko... Nothing, forget it...<br>
All in all, NEKO has no idea how to take care of a three\-year\-old kid like him. You guys should find other ways to handle him...

**Kouhei**<br>
You just have to look over him for a little while. We'll return in a few hours.

**Neko**<br>
... Bet it's a date again, is it? Big liar...

**Kouhei**<br>
What did you say?

**Neko**<br>
Nothing! Do what ever you guys want. If you want to go out, do as you please.

**Kouhei**<br>
... Then we'll leave it to you.

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Neko**<br>
Arghhh! Stupid daddy! Smelly Feet! Big dumb liar...

**Kenta**<br>
......

**Neko**<br>
... W, what are you looking at? Go watch TV in the living room yourself. NEKO's gonna go back to sleep.

*\[Glass shatters\]*

**Neko**<br>
YIKES!?<br>
What, what happened?

**Kenta**<br>
*\*Sobs\*... \*Cries\*\~\~*

**Neko**<br>
... Did you break the glass because you're trying to drink water? Are you hurt!?<br>
Oh god oh dear... D, don't cry...

**Neko**<br>
Whew\~ All cleaned up. Don't come over here though.<br>
Here, water. You wanted water, right?

**Kenta**<br>
... (Nods)

**Neko**<br>
Thank goodness, you're not hurt...<br>
Man\~ Guess I can't just leave you alone. If you want something, just tell big sister, got it? If anything happens to you, it would cause a boatload of trouble!

**Kenta**<br>
... *\*Sniff\**... (Nods)

**Neko**<br>
Ahhhh, come on, stop crying. You're a boy, aren't you?

**Kenta**<br>
... *\*Sniff sniff\**... (Nods)

**Neko**<br>
Uwaaa... What a pain in the neck...... B, but, he's so adorable...<br>
Ah! Video games! Do you like video games? Big sister has a lot of fun games!

**Kenta**<br>
... Yes...

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

**Neko**<br>
Ah, you have to jump here! That's it, that's it!

**Kenta**<br>
Haha! ! He fly away! Big sister is awesome!

**Neko**<br>
Hmph\~ of course I am! Alright, time for the next level!

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Kouhei**<br>
We're home... Ho? Looks like you guys are having a lot of fun.

**Yukiko**<br>
I'm relived... NEKO, thank you so much for taking care of him.

**Neko**<br>
... O, oh.

**Yukiko**<br>
Kenta, did you behave yourself?

**Kenta**<br>
Yes\~ Mama, look! Big sister is awesome! We are almost at the boss!

**Neko**<br>
... I'm done here, right? Since you guys are back now, NEKO will be heading out.

**Kenta**<br>
... Big sister?

**Kouhei**<br>
Where are you going at this time? It's almost dinner time.

**Neko**<br>
NEKO has some things to deal with, so I'll be eating out. You three can eat by yourselves... bye.

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Yukiko**<br>
......<br>
Kouhei, I...

**Kouhei**<br>
No need to worry. She just so happens to be at that age. Give her some time.
