*[Call Starts]*

**Neko**<br>
Linda\-chan! NEKO hasn't heard your voice in ages! I miss you so much!

**[Linda]**<br>
*Still exaggerating things as always. Didn't we just meet up last week?*

**Neko**<br>
Eh\~ So cold! NEKO missed you for real! Ah, right; how was it? Did the interview go well?

**[Linda]**<br>
*I got accepted! I'll be working at Under Velvet starting next week.*

**Neko**<br>
WOW! Congratulations! I'm so happy for you! Linda\-chan will be working in the administration department, right? Then we'll get to see so many free performances!

**[Linda]**<br>
*What else do you think I applied for a job there for? Haha. Shouldn't be too hard to get free performances. However, judging by how busy you are these days, do you even have time to come?*

**Neko**<br>
No worries. It's not like NEKO wants to stream every day either! It's quite an exhausting thing! And you have to come up with topics to talk about!<br>
By the way, why don't Linda\-chan come watch NEKO's stream? NEKO feels so lonely...

**[Linda]**<br>
*You know perfectly well that I'm not interested in this kind of internet culture, right? Music is really all I need in my life. Besides, when it comes to performances, nothing beats a live one, doesn't it?*

**Neko**<br>
Ummm... Linda\-chan has become an adult\~

**[Linda]**<br>
*More like you never grew up? 151...*

**Neko**<br>
Boo boo! Wrong\~! I'm 155 now! NEKO is still in her growth period! I will keep growing taller! Linda\-chan is so mean!

**[Linda]**<br>
*Hahaha, how old are you now? Reality's brutal, but you gotta accept it\~<br>
Speaking of music, haven't seen you perform for a while now. I miss your last performance; you know, the one where you played songs on the UV stage.*

**Neko**<br>
That's because NEKO has been getting virtual LIVE cases these days. I even turned down a super big invitation not too long ago!

**[Linda]**<br>
*Virtual ones, eh...*

**Neko**<br>
Virtual LIVES are pretty awesome\~ You can perform at home, and the audience doesn't have to leave theirs to watch you perform either.

**[Linda]**<br>
*You do have a point, but I still prefer physical performances. That's why I applied for this job... Speaking of my job, there's a famous band from Node 54 coming this week. I'm a bit nervous\~ Really hope everything can go smoothly...*

**Neko**<br>
Linda\-chan is very capable; everything's gonna be a\-ok! Teehee\~

**[Linda]**<br>
*Teehee my a\*\*... Why did you decline that super big invitation though?*

**Neko**<br>
It's that Æsir guy. He's holding this mega music festival and he invited NEKO to perform. Although NEKO is very interested...

**[Linda]**<br>
*Æsir!? That's a fantastic honor! Why did you turn it down?*

**Neko**<br>
Because he invited a boatload of Mono's artists... and he invited PAFF too! NEKO has ZERO intention to be on the same stage with PAFF! Besides, I am 99.99% sure she'll sing the songs NEKO arranged, which makes me even more p\*\*\*ed off!

**[Linda]**<br>
*Oh... I see. If that's the case, then I can understand. You've been complaining to me about that for so many years now...*

**Neko**<br>
Ah, but it appears that "Cherry PuNK" is also invited! NEKO really wants to be on stage together with Cherry...

**[Linda]**<br>
*Indeed. I was so touched when I saw the news of Cherry's comeback! Ah...but there's a bad news. Last week, I caught wind of the news that they are on the verge of being signed by Mono...*

**Neko**<br>
EHHHHH!? You serious? NOOOOOO! Cherry, don't join Mono! They will squeeze you until you have no value left then trash you! That makes NEKO so conflicted\~ Should I boycott their music or not!?

**[Linda]**<br>
*You're exaggerating things again... Personally, I don't really mind...*

**Neko**<br>
Sigh\~ So\~\~ annoying! Eh, when should we meet up again next time? My fans have told NEKO about this delicious ramen shop...

**[Linda]**<br>
*Hahaha, you shouldn't be asking me. You should be asking yourself. When will you be free, you busy little kitten\~?*

**Neko**<br>
Ummm... Next Thursday, 07:00 PM! At the main entrance of UV!

**[Linda]**<br>
*No problem, see you then!<br>
That's it for now. I gotta prepare for work. Good luck with tonight's stream.*

**Neko**<br>
OK! Bye\-bye, Linda\-chan\~
