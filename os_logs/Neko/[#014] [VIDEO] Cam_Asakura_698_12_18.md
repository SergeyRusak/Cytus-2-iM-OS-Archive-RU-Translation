**Neko**<br>
They should be already asleep, right...?

**Kouhei**<br>
NEKO? Is that you?

**Neko**<br>
Wah! Crap...

**Kouhei**<br>
... Woah! What's with the clothes you're wearing?

**Neko**<br>
... What?

**Kouhei**<br>
We haven't seen you for days, and you come home looking like this!? <br>
Coming home at this hour, where were you all this time!?

**Neko**<br>
You done? NEKO is gonna sleep.

**Kouhei**<br>
Wait, what's with the attitude? Come here; daddy needs to have a talk with you.

**Neko**<br>
What is there to talk about!?

**Kouhei**<br>
Plenty to talk about.<br>
You're secretly owning a cat in your room, aren't you? Didn't I tell you that Yukiko is allergic to cats?

**Neko**<br>
So what? I gave it away a long time ago.

**Neko**<br>
Yukiko, Yukiko... everything is about Yukiko. So damn annoying...

**Yukiko**<br>
Kouhei? Is NEKO back?

**Kouhei**<br>
Ah, Yukiko, sorry for waking you up...

**Neko**<br>
... Ah, right. You guys are sleeping together now.<br>
NEKO is very tired. If you want to talk, we'll talk tomorrow. I'm going back to my room.

**Kouhei**<br>
Did you go out with that Linda again?

**Neko**<br>
... And what does that have to do with you?

**Kouhei**<br>
What? You are not allowed to go out with her again! From now on, after classes are over, you come home directly! It's all those band stuff that turned you into the mess you are and taught you all this nonsense! From now on, you are not allowed to see any performance again!

**Neko**<br>
Ha? Come home for what!? See you two act so lovey\-dovey together!? Eww, gross!

**Yukiko**<br>
......

**Kouhei**<br>
What is with your attitude... who taught you that!? It's Linda, isn't it? Is this how she treats her parents back at her home too!?

**Neko**<br>
OK, that's it! Who do you think you are, a psychic!? Linda is not that kind of person!

**Yukiko**<br>
Ok, ok, that's enough! Both of you, calm down...... Kouhei!

**Kouhei**<br>
......

**Neko**<br>
......

**Yukiko**<br>
NEKO, please don't be angry. Kouhei didn't say that on purpose. We don't really understand young people... It's not like what you're doing is bad; we're just very worried about you...

**Neko**<br>
Worried? No need for that. You and Kenta are already plenty enough for him to worry about, right?

**Yukiko**<br>
......

**Neko**<br>
Who didn't know that you reached out to this home for the money?

**Kouhei**<br>
NEKO！！

**Neko**<br>
What!? Am I wrong? NEKO knew all of it already!

**Yukiko**<br>
NEKO... that's really not the case! I'm very grateful to your father for helping me with my money problems. However, even without that, I still truly love him. I truly want to be a part of this family...

**Neko**<br>
HA!? Ewwwww! If you just want the money, then stop trying to act like a mother!...  You disgusting whore!!

**Yukiko**<br>
......!!

**Neko**<br>
Ouch......!

**Kouhei**<br>
APOLOGIZE TO HER RIGHT NOW, NEKO!

**Yukiko**<br>
Kouhei! Don't do this! NEKO, are you hurt...

**Kouhei**<br>
How dare you talk to me about money! Do you know how much money I spend to raise you!? And what do you do with my money? You waste it on dying hair, messing around, and buying these nonsensical clothes! Is this how you repay me!?

**Neko**<br>
NEKO... made that money... with my part\-time job... 

**Kouhei**<br>
What part\-time job!? The one where you abandoned your studies for!? Very well, if you're so good, I will no longer give you a single penny! If this home is so worthless to you, then leave! GET OUT!

**Neko**<br>
......!

*\[Hurried Footsteps\]*

*\[Slams Door\]*

**Kouhei**<br>
Fine! Go! Don't you dare come back again!

**Yukiko**<br>
Kouhei! Stop it! Go after her, quick! Where did you expect her to go at this time of the night!?

**Kouhei**<br>
No need!

**Yukiko**<br>
... NEKO was so angry because of me, so maybe I'm not qualified to say this...<br>
But, for the sake of defending me, you choose to lose NEKO... lose your only family member. Do you really believe that is the right thing to do?

**Kouhei**<br>
......
