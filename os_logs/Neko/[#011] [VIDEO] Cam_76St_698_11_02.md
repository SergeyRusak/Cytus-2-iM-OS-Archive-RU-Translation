**Neko**<br>
Ugh~ this sucks. Why does it rain so much these days... Man, even my dinner is all soaked!

**Cat**<br>
Meow~

**Neko**<br>
Eek!? What is that noise?

**Neko**<br>
Ah, a little kitten...<br>
Why is it hiding here? Did someone abandon it?

**Cat**<br>
Meow...

**Neko**<br>
Poor little fella... Wanna eat this?

**Cat**<br>
Meow...

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

**Cat**<br>
Meow~

**Neko**<br>
Is it tasty? No need to hurry. Take your time.<br>
You don't have a chip collar... We won't be able to find your owner without that...

**Neko**<br>
If left in this rain, it'll catch a cold... Also, stray animals without chips will be taken away by the admins... what should I do?

**Agent**<br>
Little girl, what are you doing, kneeling down in an alleyway? In this massive downpour too.

**Neko**<br>
Yikes! Crap... I was just saying...

**Agent**<br>
Little girl? Please turn around.

**Neko**<br>
Ah... NEKO... No, I'm not feeling so well...

**Cat**<br>
Meow~

**Neko**<br>
Ah... Shhhh! You'll be taken away!

**Agent**<br>
... What's that noise? Is it a cat?

*\[Hurried Footsteps\]*

**Xenon**<br>
......?<br>
It's you... what are you doing?

![naos1102.png](./attachments/naos1102.png)

**Neko**<br>
Ah! This person! This person was trying to molest me!

**Xenon**<br>
......

**Agent**<br>
What!? Is that true!?

**Neko**<br>
Ahhhhh... What the hell am I talking about...

**Xenon**<br>
......<br>
Yes. I was going to ask her for directions, but my hand accidentally touched her chest. It really was an accident.

**Neko**<br>
... Eh?

**Agent**<br>
... Sir, please come over here for the scanning procedure.<br>
This is Quadrant III, 76th street, an alleyway next to the Game Center. There's a report about a suspected sexual harassment incident. Please send LE\-112A drones for support.

**Xenon**<br>
Take it and leave, now.

**Neko**<br>
Eh? Ah... got it.

*\[Hurried Footsteps\]*

**Agent**<br>
Ah! She ran away! So you were indeed molesting her!?

**Xenon**<br>
I told you it was an accident...

**Agent**<br>
Don't move! Stand still and let me scan you.

**Xenon**<br>
......

*\[ID Scan\]*

**[Scanner]**<br>
*Unable to detect target. Please scan again.*

**Agent**<br>
Eh? Sir, please stand still!

**Xenon**<br>
I am standing still. That thing's broken, isn't it?
