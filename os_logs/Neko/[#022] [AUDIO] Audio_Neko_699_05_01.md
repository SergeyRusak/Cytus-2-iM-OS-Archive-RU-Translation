*\[Rips contract\]*

**Neko**<br>
NEKO will no longer do anything for a s\*\*\*hole company like yours! I will never be your ghost producer ever again! I look like a fool!<br>
I've already paid for the liquidated damages, so that's it! Goodbye!

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

**Neko**<br>
UGH! I'm so mad! Trash Company!!<br>
Only idiots will produce music for your stupid faces! BLEHHHHH~!!

**Neko**<br>
......

**Neko**<br>
...

**Yukiko**<br>
......NEKO?

**Neko**<br>
...... Sis Yukiko? Why are you here?

**Yukiko**<br>
I went to the supermarket to buy ingredients for dinner... Ah, so this is the company NEKO makes music for? <br>
What a coincidence.

**Neko**<br>
......

**Yukiko**<br>
NEKO... Are you crying?

**Neko**<br>
I, I'm not! I'm just yawning...

**Yukiko**<br>
I saw you rushing out of the company... Umm, did something happen? Maybe I can help...

**Neko**<br>
... Nothing. It's none of your business.

**Yukiko**<br>
... You're right. I'm sorry. I shouldn't bother you. I just hope everything goes smoothly for NEKO. After all, NEKO's music is really amazing.

**Neko**<br>
... Sis Yukiko, you've heard NEKO's music?

**Yukiko**<br>
Yes, it's very unique.<br>
... It was Kouhei who played them for me.

**Neko**<br>
Huh? Daddy? What does he know about NEKO's music? Isn't he the one who's always whining about these things being "bad for you" and hates it whenever NEKO does them?

**Yukiko**<br>
He only said those things to vent his anger... NEKO knew that, didn't you?<br>
In reality, he often talks about how the music is the proud work of his daughter. Even though he couldn't recognize a single note, he still tries his best to understand your music.

**Neko**<br>
......<br>
He is so dumb...

**Yukiko**<br>
NEKO... Kouhei is not angry anymore. We all genuinely want you to come back.

**Neko**<br>
......

**Yukiko**<br>
You don't have to live in the house, but... maybe you can visit us from time to time, so we can catch up on what you're doing. We can have a quick chat, or cook together again... Kenta misses you very much too.

**Neko**<br>
... NEKO was making music and working part\-time because I want to go back to Node 03. I need money for the trip. Now that I quit work, NEKO will be going back very soon...

**Yukiko**<br>
Ah... so something indeed happened between you and the company?<br>
... Are you... returning to Node 03?

**Neko**<br>
W, what? You got a problem with that?

**Yukiko**<br>
... No. That's fine too.<br>
Whenever you do decide to visit, come play with Kenta. He has been sulking every day since you left...

**Neko**<br>
Kenta......

**Neko**<br>
......

**Neko**<br>
Sis Yukiko, can I ask you a question...?

**Yukiko**<br>
Sure.

**Neko**<br>
You... Just what did you see in my dad? Your ages differ by so much. Sis Yukiko is so pretty. My dad, on the other hand, is unattractive, and useless, and his feet smell... Why did you still...

**Yukiko**<br>
......

**Yukiko**<br>
NEKO, I understand that no matter what I say, it would be hard for you to believe. However, I really, really do love Kouhei. Also, it has nothing to do with my debts...

**Neko**<br>
......

**Yukiko**<br>
My ex\-husband was the worst kind of partner... Even until now, both Kenta and I still suffer hardships because of him.<br>
I was ready to accept that this is going to be my life. There's no way to escape and I would have to raise Kenta all by myself... Yet your father is willing to try his best to help us... He even gave us a proper "family", something I never even bothered to dream about...

**Yukiko**<br>
I am truly... truly grateful... *\*Sniffs\*...*

**Neko**<br>
Sis Yukiko...

**Yukiko**<br>
I'm sorry, NEKO... I know this is very selfish of me, but I don't want to see Kouhei give up his own family in order to give us one...

**Neko**<br>
......

**Neko**<br>
... All in all, NEKO has already made up her mind to return to my mom. Daddy really loves you, right? Then he should be just fine even without NEKO...

**Yukiko**<br>
... That's not true...

**Neko**<br>
That's it for now. NEKO will go back in a few days to clean out my stuff.

**Yukiko**<br>
... I see. Then at the very least, have a meal together with us before you go, okay?

**Neko**<br>
W, we'll see about that... I have to go now, bye\-bye.

*\[Footsteps\]*

**Neko**<br>
......

**Neko**<br>
Mom... NEKO can't decide...
