**Neko**<br>
Papa, look!

**Kouhei**<br>
Ho? A castle? It's very pretty.

**Neko**<br>
Yes! NEKO, papa, mama and grandma all lives here. It's really big inside! NEKO is in the biggest room!

**Kouhei**<br>
... Sorry. Our current house is way too cramped for four people, isn't it?

**Neko**<br>
It's alright. NEKO will make so\~ much so much money when she grows up! We will live together in a very big place!

**Kouhei**<br>
No.

**Neko**<br>
Ehhhhh\~ Why?

**Kouhei**<br>
Because that's daddy's job, you little brat.

**Saku**<br>
I'm very satisfied with what we have.

**Neko**<br>
Ah, mama! Are you done shopping?

**Saku**<br>
Yes, sorry for making you guys wait. Let's go home. Mommy bought some tasty pork belly.

**Neko**<br>
Yip\~pee! Pork belly! ...... What is that?

**Kouhei**<br>
Haha... It's a kind of really delicious meat.

**Saku**<br>
NEKO, do you want to try making it? I can let you use the cutting knife today.

**Neko**<br>
Really!? I want to try!!

**Mayu**<br>
Welcome back.

**Neko**<br>
Grandma! NEKO built a really big castle today!

**Saku**<br>
Ok, ok\~ Go wash your hands and change your clothes. We don't want dirt in our dinner, do we?

**Neko**<br>
OK\~\~

**Mayu**<br>
So NEKO will be making dinner today? Is it alright? Maybe I should do it after all?

**Saku**<br>
Mom, your waist hasn't fully recovered yet, right? NEKO is seven years old already; we can handle it\~ You take your rest.

**Kouhei**<br>
Here, ma. Let me help you.

**Mayu**<br>
Thank you, Kouhei. It's good to have you here.

**Kouhei**<br>
Saku, today... that Node 08 company called again. I was thinking...

**Saku**<br>
This again... I don't understand. Why are you so persistent about this?

**Kouhei**<br>
I explained many times already. <br>
The environment there is much better than here! Why shouldn't we move the whole family there?

**Saku**<br>
NEKO has finally gotten used to a new environment. Mom doesn't move very well either. If we're moving to a place this far away all of a sudden...

**Kouhei**<br>
That's why I said we should go there! All of our problems can be solved! Did you forget that we were forced to move because our "offering" level was not high enough...<br>
Please, reconsider this, okay? That company has high expectations for me. I can promise you. We will be so many times happier than we are right now!

**Saku**<br>
I'm already very happy now! Being with mom, you... and NEKO, all of us together in this small but cozy home...Are you not happy with this?

**Kouhei**<br>
That's not what I mean... But in Node 03... I worked hard to earn money, only to be forced to hand in all of it to the gang\-controlled Administration Bureau because of that offering nonsense. If we leave here, we won't have to worry about any of this!

**Saku**<br>
That's why we have to work hard together. I'm also working very hard...

**Kouhei**<br>
What can you change with those spare changes you make!?

**Saku**<br>
......

**Kouhei**<br>
... I... I'm sorry... I...

**Saku**<br>
... Every day, I... take care of those children who can't afford to go to a doctor. When I see the smiles on their and their families' faces... I feel like I make more than anybody else.

**Kouhei**<br>
......

**Saku**<br>
Kouhei, I don't know what your imagination of happiness is, but that's all just your illusion... If you really care about your own achievements and happiness, then go...

**Kouhei**<br>
... That is it for today. I'm tired from arguing with you.

**Neko**<br>
......
