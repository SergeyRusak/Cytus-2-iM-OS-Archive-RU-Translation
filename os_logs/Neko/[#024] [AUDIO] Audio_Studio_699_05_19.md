*\[Door Knock\]*

**Xenon**<br>
Umm... Who's there? It's the middle of the night...

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Xenon**<br>
NEKO......？

**Neko**<br>
......

*\[Collapses\]*

**Xenon**<br>
Woah!

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

**Xenon**<br>
You awake?

**Neko**<br>
Ugh... Ow, that hurt...

**Xenon**<br>
You scraped your knee. Since it's not a serious injury, I just sort of patched it up...

**Neko**<br>
... NEKO has been kidnapped!!

**Xenon**<br>
......?<br>
The heck? You ran here yourself...

**Neko**<br>
Not you! Bad people!

**Xenon**<br>
...... Huh?

**Neko**<br>
Ran away!

**Xenon**<br>
......?

**Neko**<br>
Ah! I have to call home ASAP! Lend me your phone!

**Xenon**<br>
Hey...

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

**Neko**<br>
Ok... Uh\-huh... NEKO is fine...<br>
Got it... I will be back in a moment, bye.

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Neko**<br>
I'm done. Here's your phone.

**Xenon**<br>
......

**Neko**<br>
Well, NEKO's gotta go.

**Xenon**<br>
Hey, aren't you going to tell me what happened? Although I more or less figured out the gist of it through your phone call.

**Neko**<br>
Why are you eavesdropping!? Eww, gross...<br>
Well... this is a problem for NEKO's family to deal with. We can't bother you with this...

**Xenon**<br>
It sounds like that group you're dealing with has something to do with cybercrime. If that's the case, the admins and I would have to interfere.

**Neko**<br>
You can't inform the admins!

**Xenon**<br>
... Why?

**Neko**<br>
If the admins knew about this... it would trouble sis Yukiko too... NEKO doesn't want that to happen.

**Xenon**<br>
......

**Neko**<br>
All in all, that's it for now...

**Xenon**<br>
It's a financial company by the name of "Horizon", right?

**Neko**<br>
... Eh? I think so...

**Xenon**<br>
I knew about that company. They are involved in a wide variety of businesses as one of the gangs' many faces on society. However, the usury business is one that hasn't been properly acknowledged yet. Therefore, it's mostly done by minor gang members through the internet. Recently, that has spread onto cyTus as well.

**Neko**<br>
......

**Xenon**<br>
... If you don't want to inform the admins, I can still think of a couple of ways to deal with them. Want to hear me out?

**Neko**<br>
But, I don't want to drag you into all this...

**Xenon**<br>
No need to worry. Just hear me out first. To be honest, I don't have to do anything at all.
