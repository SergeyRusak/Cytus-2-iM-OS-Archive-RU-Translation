**Kouhei**<br>
I'm home.

**Kouhei**<br>
......

**[Message]**<br>
*Didn't you say that you'll be home at six???

Dinner is in the fridge, NEKO will be sleeping first. Do not disturb

NEKO\#Φˋ︿ˊΦ*

**Kouhei**<br>
......

*\[Door Knock\]*

**Kouhei**<br>
NEKO, are you asleep?

**Neko**<br>
... I'm asleep.

**Kouhei**<br>
... I'm coming in.

**Neko**<br>
... From now on, if you're not coming back for dinner, at least tell me, ok? If that's the case, NEKO wouldn't bother cooking. What a waste of ingredients.

**Kouhei**<br>
I'm sorry...

**Neko**<br>
Anything else? If not, NEKO's gonna sleep.

**Kouhei**<br>
NEKO, daddy wants to discuss something with you.

**Neko**<br>
......

**Kouhei**<br>
Aren't you going to sit up and listen? It's something quite important.

**Neko**<br>
... Just tell me.

**Kouhei**<br>
Daddy... and Yukiko...<br>
might be getting married soon.

**Neko**<br>
HUH!?

**Kouhei**<br>
I want to discuss this with you. The hope is that starting next month, she and Kenta will move in and live together with us. The storage room will be cleared out so it can be Kenta's room.

**Neko**<br>
......

**Kouhei**<br>
NEKO should know already. Daddy and Yukiko... even though our relationship started out as just boss and subordinate, as time goes on, we gradually developed feelings for each other...

**Neko**<br>
......

**Kouhei**<br>
Yukiko and Kenta also like you a lot. If we live together, you wouldn't have to work so hard handling all the minute work in this house. It's better for you as well.

**Neko**<br>
......

**Kouhei**<br>
NEKO?

**Neko**<br>
... Does this even count as a discussion? You guys already made your decision, didn't you?

**Kouhei**<br>
No, NEKO lives in this house too. If you're not willing to, we will figure out other methods...

**Neko**<br>
That's not the point! This is marriage! What about mommy!?

**Kouhei**<br>
... NEKO, daddy and mommy are already...

**Neko**<br>
Besides, NEKO heard it last time. Sis Yukiko owes some people out there a lot of money, and daddy has been helping her regarding this issue, right!?

**Kouhei**<br>
......!<br>
Yes. It's debt left behind by her ex\-husband. She is in a tough situation too...

**Neko**<br>
Ha?? Daddy, are you stupid!? NEKO knew that! I also knew that you haven't send money back to mommy for a while now, haven't you!? Is this the reason why!?

**Kouhei**<br>
I...

**Neko**<br>
Have you never consider the possibility that she chose to be with you only for the money!?

**Kouhei**<br>
NEKO! Yukiko is not that kind of person! You knew that very well, didn't you!?

**Neko**<br>
... How would... NEKO know...

**Kouhei**<br>
......

**Neko**<br>
... In short, you guys already made the decision, right? Then what's NEKO gonna change?

**Kouhei**<br>
......

**Neko**<br>
Do whatever you please. That's all I have to say. NEKO's gonna sleep now.

**Kouhei**<br>
......

**Kouhei**<br>
...I'm sorry...

*\[Door Closes\]*

**Neko**<br>
NEKO is so dumb for coming to Node 08 with daddy...
