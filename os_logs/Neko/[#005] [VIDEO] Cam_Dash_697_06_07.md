**Neko**<br>
Daddy, over here!

**Kouhei**<br>
How did the day go? Is everything alright in class?

**Neko**<br>
Same as always. Got plenty of sleep. Teehee\~

**Kouhei**<br>
Pay more attention in class...<br>
Get in the car. Aren't you in a hurry to see that performance or something?

**Neko**<br>
Yep! Thank goodness that daddy can take me there. If not for this, there's no way I can make it on time.

**Kouhei**<br>
The classmate who's really close to you... Linda, is she not coming with you?

**Neko**<br>
Yeah, something else came up for her today. What a shame...

**Kouhei**<br>
That girl looks like the nasty type. I hope she won't have a bad influence on you.

**Neko**<br>
Daddy\~ you're spewing nonsense again! NEKO told you many times before! Linda is a very good girl; got it!? Stop saying that about her!

**Kouhei**<br>
OK\~ OK\~

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Neko**<br>
Wah! Why is there someone else!?

**Kouhei**<br>
Ah, sorry. NEKO, can you sit in the back seat? Today, we're also giving my colleague here a ride.

**Neko**<br>
Eh? Oh, okay...

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Yukiko**<br>
Sorry for the intrusion...

**Neko**<br>
N, not at all...

**Kouhei**<br>
A quick introduction. This is Yukiko. She works for me in the company. Like us, she is also from Node 03. Some business Just so happens to come up, so we're giving her a ride to the branch office.<br>
Yukiko, this is my daughter, NEKO.

**Neko**<br>
Yukiko...

**Yukiko**<br>
Hello, I'll be in your care for the trip. Director... ah, I mean your father, has helped me a lot at work.

**Neko**<br>
Eh? Oh, oh, hi...

**Yukiko**<br>
Your daughter is so cute...<br>
Your father mentions you a lot.

**Neko**<br>
Eh? Ahaha... Sis Yukiko is really pretty yourself! I didn't know that daddy has a colleague this good\-looking... Maybe NEKO should work there as well in the future!

**Yukiko**<br>
Haha, thank you. Our company is pretty tough though\~

**Neko**<br>
If NEKO helps out too, it will definitely be easier! I bet it is really hard working for daddy, right?

**Yukiko**<br>
Eh? No, that's not the case...

**Kouhei**<br>
You little...

**Neko**<br>
What? It's not like NEKO doesn't have a point! Daddy may look capable and reliable, but he is actually super clumsy! He spills things all the time!

**Kouhei**<br>
Eh...?

**Neko**<br>
On top of that, his "let me do everything" personality is also super\~ troubling, right? For example, he is always fighting for the chance to cook even though both of us knew how much his cooking sucks\~ NEKO had to clean up his mess every time.

**Kouhei**<br>
Ok, ok, I get it! Geez, you don't have to tell her everything...

**Yukiko**<br>
Pffft... You weren't kidding. Your daughter really does know you very well.

**Neko**<br>
Teehee\~

**Yukiko**<br>
So, NEKO is good at cooking? I also like cooking a lot.

**Neko**<br>
For real? NEKO loves cooking too! Because it's something taught by mommy\~ Besides, it's so darn expensive eating out at Node 08!

**Yukiko**<br>
I agree. I too miss the cheap and tasty restaurants back in Node 03... However, work has been quite busy these days. I can't cook very often, so take\-outs are often the only option.

**Neko**<br>
Work too busy? Da\~\~\~ddy! Is it your fault!? Are you dumping all your work to her!?<br>
Drunkard! Couch Potato! Smelly Feet!

**Kouhei**<br>
Ummm... No, I didn't. NEKO, don't just blurt out things!

**Yukiko**<br>
Haha... You two are so close to each other.

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

**Kouhei**<br>
We're here. This is the place, right?<br>
I'll come pick you up after the event is over.

**Neko**<br>
Gotcha\~! Hehe, NEKO is so hyped up about this!

**Kouhei**<br>
Be careful yourself when you're messing around here. Stay in contact.

**Neko**<br>
Uh\-huh! Bye\-bye, sis Yukiko\~ Don't forget our deal. Next time, when you visit NEKO's house, we can cook together!

**Yukiko**<br>
Of course. I'll look forward to that\~ Goodbye.

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Kouhei**<br>
She seems to like you a lot.

**Yukiko**<br>
Thank goodness...
