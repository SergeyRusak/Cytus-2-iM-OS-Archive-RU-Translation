*\[Eats Snacks\]*

**Xenon**<br>
Hey, I thought I told you not to eat snacks in here? Take it outside.

**Neko**<br>
NO! It's too stuffy outside!

**Xenon**<br>
I've turned on the AC, go outside.

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Neko**<br>
Mu\-ki~~~ You're the one who said you're making a new song. That's why NEKO came to help.<br>
What's with your attitude?

**Xenon**<br>
Be quiet. If you ruin the equipment then we won't be able to make anything.

**Neko**<br>
Muuuu...<br>
Ah, right! The money for this composition, can you transfer it to NEKO first? I was planning to return to the Academy, only to then discover that I couldn't afford the tuition at all... And I don't want to rely on that dumb dad of mine so soon after I went back...

**Xenon**<br>
I could, but didn't you made some money from Mono and your part\-time jobs? Where did those go?

**Neko**<br>
Thanks to the liquidated damage payments, not a single dollar left... Damnit... Stupid Mono! Stupid PAFF!

**Xenon**<br>
... You used to be her fan, aren't you?

**Neko**<br>
Not anymore!<br>
Aw man~ NEKO originally planned to start sending some money back to Node 03 in place of dad... I previously said I was moving back, and then I regretted it all of a sudden. I hope mom won't be too disappointed about this...

**Xenon**<br>
... If you want to make money, our company has been recruiting beta testers for a new project recently. You can treat it as an extracurricular activity...  Do you want to try?

**Neko**<br>
Eh? What kind of project?

**Xenon**<br>
Develop a virtual internet streaming service based on the iM platform. The users can interact with each other in a virtual space using the virtual internet. If the viewers like the content, they can also subscribe and sponsor the users. If it's you... perhaps you can manage to create a pretty interesting channel?

**Neko**<br>
Hoho~ Sounds like so much fun! NEKO wants to try it out!

**Xenon**<br>
Then I'll send you the information. You'll have to come in for an interview yourself. I'm not from that department.

**Neko**<br>
Got it! Thanks~

**Xenon**<br>
Oh, and another thing... what happened to those people afterward? They still bothering you?

**Neko**<br>
Eh? You mean the debt collectors? Nope~ Not only that, they even sent an apology letter to sis Yukiko! Talking about how they hope X could forgive them and things like that. So that name really has this kind of power? It... feels so cool!

**Xenon**<br>
... I didn't expect them to be that terrified either. However, judging by the range of their activities, you shouldn't have to be concerned anymore.

**Neko**<br>
Also, about the script you gave us... even though dad seems really into it, but about the cyTus chip exploding stuff... is that true or not?

**Xenon**<br>
Of course it's fake. If the chips really do explode, they wouldn't even get to the point where the admins get involved. They won't even make it past the Q.A. process within A.R.C. itself. What happened back there was a simple remote\-controlled overcharge that increases the temperature of the devices. It's pretty much just a scary prank.

**Neko**<br>
I see... NEKO was wondering whether I should remove the chip after seeing that too...

**Xenon**<br>
Let me guess, you didn't because you couldn't survive a day without the internet?

**Neko**<br>
Teehee~ Bingo!

**Xenon**<br>
All in all, good to see that you're safe.

**Neko**<br>
......

*\[Eats Snacks\]*

**Xenon**<br>
What's wrong? If you're done eating, go back and continue.

**Neko**<br>
...... Thank you.

**Xenon**<br>
Huh?

**Neko**<br>
N, NEKO says thank you!

**Xenon**<br>
......?<br>
For what?

**Neko**<br>
N, nothing..... Just... for all sorts of things...

**Xenon**<br>
What? I didn't do anything though?<br>
Come on in; we need to finish the remaining sections.

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Neko**<br>
You did help NEKO out... At least let NEKO say thank you...

*[Signal Lost]*
