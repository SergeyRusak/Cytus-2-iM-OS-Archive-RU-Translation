*[Call Starts]*

**[Neko]**<br>
*Hi hi, NEKO here\~*

**Chris**<br>
What "HI hi"? You messed up big time! You need to delete that post on iM right away!

**[Neko]**<br>
*Eh\~? What's the deal this time...*

**Chris**<br>
About the collab single with company T a while ago, they haven't even announced it yet. Why did you post it on your own iM already!?

**[Neko]**<br>
*Eh\~? I can't? That's a collab song with NEKO, isn't it? Why can't NEKO post it?*

**Chris**<br>
Idiot! That collab song has a contract! We are required to cooperate with the promotion schedule. What makes you think you can just go off\-track like that?

**[Neko]**<br>
*Muuu\~ but deleting something already posted feels really weird...*

**Chris**<br>
That's your problem... In short, delete it now, before things get really messy!

**[Neko]**<br>
*Ok, ok. Then exactly when can I post it?*

**Chris**<br>
We send you the promotion schedule whenever we have a meeting. You didn't read any of them, did you?

**[Neko]**<br>
*What a pain in the neck... Why are there so many weird rules in the company? NEKO made that song...*

**Chris**<br>
What's weird about that... Speaking of iM, I advise you stop gossiping about other artists on it. You didn't even keep them anonymous...

**[Neko]**<br>
*NEKO did not do that!*

**Chris**<br>
But you totally did! Some artists are already filing complaints to us. If it's company information, try your best to not leak it. Please keep yourself under control online as well. Have you forgotten about the previous plagiarizing incident... 

**[Neko]**<br>
*Haaa!? Isn't he the one who plagiarized NEKO!? NEKO's Demo was composed last year; he just announced it earlier! The incident was a thing because too many people don't know what the hell they are talking about!<br>
Besides, if we get to the bottom of this, we got our materials from the same sample pack. Plagiarism my a\*\*...*

**Chris**<br>
You can't expect an average person to know that, can you...?<br>
Regardless, pay more attention to what you do. If this keeps happening, it makes it hard for me to promote you...

**[Neko]**<br>
*NEKO don't really give a damn about that promotion stuff. It's not like NEKO actually want to be an artist or something. As long as I get the money for my music, I'll be fine.*

**Chris**<br>
......

**[Neko]**<br>
*If you don't have anything else to say, NEKO will go back to work. I'm arranging PAFF's song now; need to focus! Byebye\~*

*[Call Ends]*

**Chris**<br>
... Sighs\~ how troublesome...
