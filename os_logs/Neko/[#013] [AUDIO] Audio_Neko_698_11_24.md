*\[Hurried Footsteps\]*

**Neko**<br>
Ha...... Ha...... Sorry, I'm a little late.

**Xenon**<br>
What "a little"... You're the one that said 09:30, right? It's already 10:12 now.

**Neko**<br>
Muuuu~ This is not the respond NEKO was hoping for...

**Xenon**<br>
Where's the cat?

**Neko**<br>
Ah, it's here~ NEKO even bought some expensive cat food for it...... They are all here.

**Cat**<br>
Meow~

**Xenon**<br>
Good. Give it to me.<br>
Then, I'll be taking my leave.

**Neko**<br>
... Ha!? What do you mean by that?

**Xenon**<br>
......?<br>
I'm taking the cat to my friend. What else do you think I'm going to do?

**Neko**<br>
NEKO took a really~~ long trip here! Yet you just took it and left? That's NOT how you do things! At least let NEKO see who are you giving the cat to!

**Xenon**<br>
... Fine, fine; do as you please.<br>
I have to warn you now though. We're going to a bar, so you can only stay outside.

**Neko**<br>
A bar? Are you sure that's okay...?

**Xenon**<br>
Rest assured, the owner is a good person, I think.

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

**Neko**<br>
Nah~ are we not there yet? NEKO's feet are aching...

**Xenon**<br>
Almost there.

**Neko**<br>
This bar owner you mentioned, is he okay? Can we really trust him to take care of the cat?

**Xenon**<br>
Hmm? Did I not tell you about this? He's not adopting the cat himself. We're just temporarily leaving it with him. He'll find a owner who is capable of taking care of it. Shouldn't take long; he has a lot of connections.

**Neko**<br>
I see...<br>
Oh, and another thing. Why don't we just meet up there? Why do we have to walk all the way from the station...

**Xenon**<br>
I didn't know that you're coming along as well... Besides, the bar's surrounding area is quite dangerous at night.

**Neko**<br>
So even Node 08 has dangerous places?

**Xenon**<br>
In places where regular folks don't usually visit? Yes.

**Neko**<br>
Compare to where NEKO lived when I was little, this is already much better.

**Xenon**<br>
You're from Node 03, right? I've heard rumors about the terrible public security there.

**Neko**<br>
Nonetheless, NEKO only lived there until I was eight. I don't remember much about my life there. The only thing I remember is that daddy and mommy often had arguments about daily life.

**Xenon**<br>
Then Node 08 just might be a tad bit better... yet it is still far from ideal. Thugs, like the ones who harassed you that day, are still everywhere.

**Neko**<br>
Ah, speaking of that! NEKO has always been wanting to ask; you were on the verge of getting your butt kicked, right? Then their bike just started driving itself for some reason... Also, that time when you were mistaken as a molester by the law enforcement agent, you got away safely that time too, didn't you? How did you do that?

**Xenon**<br>
Hmm... some minor skills. I work at A.R.C., so I know a few things about programming and coding.

**Neko**<br>
Eh!? You serious? How is that possible? How old is Xenon now?

**Xenon**<br>
Twenty\-two.

**Neko**<br>
So young! And you're already working at A.R.C!? Yet another big news...

**Xenon**<br>
It seems like everything is big new to you... Speaking of age, last time, you brought up that you were 16?

**Neko**<br>
Yep.

**Xenon**<br>
You shouldn't wander around on the streets this late into the night. Your family will be worried.

**Neko**<br>
......

**Xenon**<br>
... Are you having trouble with your family?

**Neko**<br>
Eh? Yeah... how did you know?

**Xenon**<br>
Just a guess... then I'll leave it at that. Nevertheless, Node 08 at night is not as safe as you imagined. You're a girl after all; you should be more careful yourself.

**Neko**<br>
Ok, ok~ So turns out that Xenon is the type who lectures people a lot...

**Xenon**<br>
Shut it... we're here.

*\[Music\]*

**Neko**<br>
JOZ......Cafe?<br>
Ho~? A music bar, eh? Feels really nice.

**Xenon**<br>
You can go in when you are 20.<br>
Wait here. I'll go bring him out here.

**Neko**<br>
Hmph! Always treating NEKO like a child...
