*\[Class Bell\]*

**Neko**<br>
Whew\~ It's over!!! I'm exhausted\~

**Classmate A**<br>
NEKO, are you going to the game center today?

**Neko**<br>
Ah! Sure, let's go! NEKO is definitely gonna crush the records today!

**Classmate B**<br>
Haha! You've already filled the high\-scores with your name, haven't you?

**Neko**<br>
I'm talking about breaking my own records again of course\~<br>
Ah, what about Linda? She coming too?

**Classmate A**<br>
Eh? Forget it. She's a complete loner. She's not going to come with us.

**Classmate B**<br>
Yeah. Besides, I think that girl is kinda scary.

**Neko**<br>
Aww, come on. Don't act like that\~ NEKO's gonna ask her!

*[â†’Signal Switch]*

**Neko**<br>
Lin\~da\~chan! I\~ found\~ you!

**Linda**<br>
Yikes!? Wha... what do you want?

**Neko**<br>
NEKO, Amy\-chan and others are gonna go to the arcades. Linda\-chan, come with us!

**Linda**<br>
Sorry, I have other things to do... Also, what's with the "Linda\-chan"...

**Neko**<br>
You didn't know? That's how we refer to close friends back in NEKO's hometown. It's cute and catchy, right?

**Linda**<br>
Oh... All in all, I pass. Besides, we're not that close to begin with, right? Stop calling me that... it's so awkward.

**Neko**<br>
Eheh\~ how come? Linda\-chan is really cute\~<br>
That aside, you should get together with everyone in class more often\~ Since your transfer, you're always by yourself. Everyone is super nice. You don't have to be so shy\~

**Linda**<br>
Hmm... It's fine. This is more an issue on my part. I'm just more used to being by myself.

**Neko**<br>
Is that so... When NEKO first transferred here, I also couldn't make any friends. I though Linda\-chan is the same too.

**Linda**<br>
You're a pretty weird person too... Usually, when people see loners like me, they don't actively approach us for a conversation.

**Neko**<br>
Eh? Really? But Linda\-chan is so cool! Your style is very unique, and you're also very cute! My classmates are also very interested in you. You should talk to everybody more often\~

**Linda**<br>
Pfff... Haha, is that so? But, no thanks. I feel like my hobbies don't seem to match up with their's...

**Neko**<br>
Hobbies... Speaking of that, Linda\-chan seems to be wearing headphones all the time. What are you listening to?

**Linda**<br>
Hmm... some indie bands. Post\-Rock, Metal\-Core... stuff like that.

**Neko**<br>
Pot... Core...? I don't quite get it. NEKO's vocabulary is not very big...

**Linda**<br>
Pffft! Pot is something you use in the kitchen! No wonder you're in class 6.

**Neko**<br>
Eheh\~ You don't get to say that, Linda\-chan! You're also in class 6! NEKO wants to hear it as well!

**Linda**<br>
Ummm, I wouldn't recommend that...

**Neko**<br>
No objections!

**Linda**<br>
Ah! HEY!

*\[Music\]*

**Linda**<br>
... How is it? Pretty noisy, right...

**Neko**<br>
SO DOPE!

**Linda**<br>
... Eh?

**Neko**<br>
This is so good! NEKO only listens to electronic music before. I never knew that such amazing music existed!

**Linda**<br>
You... like it?

**Neko**<br>
I do! What band is this!? Tell NEKO more about it!

**Linda**<br>
Ah, it's a band by the name of "Crystal PuNK"! Unfortunately, they already disbanded... They were originally going to host a music festival at the end of this year.

**Neko**<br>
EHH? What a shame! Such an awesome band too!

**Linda**<br>
Then you should try this song too. It's from an old band call "GuluJam". CP was heavily influenced by them!

**Neko**<br>
Wow wow WOW! This is so\~ good!!

**Linda**<br>
Thank goodness... So there are still people in class who likes music. Other people only find it to be really loud and noisy...

**Neko**<br>
Hmm... NEKO rarely talks to them about music too. But this is really good stuff! NEKO likes it a lot!

**Linda**<br>
Then we should watch a performance at "Under Velvet" next time!<br>
It's Node 08's best Live House!

**Neko**<br>
You bet!
