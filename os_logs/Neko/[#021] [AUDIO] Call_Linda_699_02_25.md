*[Call Starts]*

**[Linda]**<br>
*Hello, NEKO? What's the matter?*

**Neko**<br>
Lin~da~Chuwan~~~

**[Linda]**<br>
*... An argument with your family again?*

**Neko**<br>
Nope! By the way, why did you start the conversation with the presumption that NEKO is going to complain about things!?

**[Linda]**<br>
*Am I wrong?*

**Neko**<br>
Ehh... Well, you're right. It's about the company...

**[Linda]**<br>
*Lemme guess; Miss super idol did something again, didn't she?*

**Neko**<br>
No kidding! Today, we bumped into each other when taking the elevator. She didn't apologize to NEKO at all! She is so arrogant! NEKO is still hurting even now!

**[Linda]**<br>
*Woah, everything alright?*

**Neko**<br>
No problemo~ NEKO has a very hard head!

**[Linda]**<br>
*Umm, I was concerned about PAFF.*

**Neko**<br>
Lin~da~Chii~~~ You're so mean!

**[Linda]**<br>
*Ahaha, so she didn't say sorry at all?*

**Neko**<br>
I think she turned around to look at me... but then she walked away in a hurry. Sis Helena is very nice to me though. She's a really good person!

**[Linda]**<br>
*Then that's not too bad. I mean, it's not uncommon for artists to have eccentric personalities, right? Without the help of their agents, it's hard for them to communicate with people... Just imagine me in the past; that's more or less it.*

**Neko**<br>
Ahaha, that's true. Linda\-chan used to not talk to other people at all.

**[Linda]**<br>
*You, on the other hand, love to talk to other people, whether it's back then or right now.*

**Neko**<br>
That's how we became super BFFs! Teehee~

**[Linda]**<br>
*Teehee my a\*\*.<br>
Say, this is just my opinion, but judging from your many complaints, collaborating with her is exhausting and the company isn't exactly friendly. Why don't you just quit this thing altogether?*

**Neko**<br>
I thought about it... but sis Helena is really nice to NEKO. PAFF... even though I have problems with her, I can't deny that her singing is truly amazing.<br>
It's really hard to find a top\-level vocalist. So many people think they're good, but all they know how to do is show off some fancy crap with no substance!

**[Linda]**<br>
*That I can understand... PAFF's singing is just... breathtaking. It's like she's singing right into my soul and feelings.*

**Neko**<br>
The vicious Linda\-chan complimented a pop singer!? Is NEKO dreaming right now!?

**[Linda]**<br>
*...... Then how about I give you a slap to wake you up? I was concerned that you'll force yourself through the job despite not enjoying it! *

**Neko**<br>
Teehee.

**[Linda]**<br>
*Teehee my a\*\*.*

**Neko**<br>
Rest assured, Linda\-chan. Even if I leave Mono, NEKO can feed myself with my music wherever I go. Besides, I also got to know a lot of great musicians and be friends with them! I'll be fine.<br>
Nevertheless, before that happens, NEKO's name will appear on PAFF's album first. Guhehehehe...

**[Linda]**<br>
*Haha, you're laughing like a perverted old man again.<br>
I'm so envious of you for knowing your path already. I'm also at the time where I need to consider my next step. I can't rely on part\-time jobs for my whole life...*

**Neko**<br>
If it's Linda\-chan, a band perhaps? Become an uber\-popular lead singer! Collab with NEKO! Release a platinum EP!<br>
Muhahaha, what a perfect plan~

**[Linda]**<br>
*I don't have PAFF's talent.<br>
In addition, it's not like I have to do everything myself. To me, simply watching performances is more than enough to satisfy me.*

**Neko**<br>
Hoho...

**[Linda]**<br>
*But still, thanks for the suggestion, NEKO. I'll think about it... Maybe there is something I can do in that industry.*

**Neko**<br>
There definitely will be! Fight, Linda\-chan!

**[Linda]**<br>
*... Haha, whenever I chat with you, I feel like my mood always lightens up.*

**Neko**<br>
... Same thing for NEKO. I don't feel so mad anymore.

**[Linda]**<br>
*Good to hear that.<br>
I have a morning shift tomorrow. Gotta sleep first. Goodnight!*

**Neko**<br>
Gotcha. NEKO's gonna sleep too. Goodnight~

*[Call Ends]*
