Li~n~da~ Chan!

**Linda**<br>
Why did you arrive so late?

**Neko**<br>
Well~ I ran into some small issues at my part\-time job... You changed your hair color! It's so stylish!

**Linda**<br>
Yeah, I got tired of the previous color. NEKO, do you want to try it yourself? My hair designer is really, really good.

**Neko**<br>
Sure~ Once NEKO get my salary, I can go get my hair dyed!

**Linda**<br>
Ah, the food is here. Since you're late, I ordered for you.

**Neko**<br>
Woah~ All stuff NEKO likes! I expect no less from Linda\-chan!

**Linda**<br>
Haha, let's finish this quickly, or else we're gonna miss the performance.

*[→Signal Switch]*

**Linda**<br>
All the bands in the lineup today are ones we've never seen before. I'm so hyped!

**Neko**<br>
Yeah~ NEKO is super excited!

**Linda**<br>
Especially this opening band Xenon; heard that this is the fastest rising new band right now!

**Neko**<br>
Xe... non? How do you pronounce it? NEKO is terrible with weird words like this...

*\[Audience cheers\]*

**Linda**<br>
Oh! It's about to start!

**Neko**<br>
Woah, everyone is wearing helmets! That is so cool!

*\[Music\]*

**Neko**<br>
Uwaa! WAAAAA! &^\*%(%(%(\#)!!!!

**Linda**<br>
WOW...!

**Neko**<br>
Waaaaaa! I'm so glad that I decided to come to this performance! NEKO is so satisfied!!

**Linda**<br>
Yeah, even though all the performers are new bands, everyone is great. Especially...

**Neko**<br>
The opening band! Xenon! That scream! That guitar! OH MY GODDD~ NEKO literally can't control myself right now!

**Linda**<br>
Stop jumping around. It's so embarrassing... However, he really was impressive. It's very rare for a band to be this good this early into their establishment. Every instrument was given its moment to shine and not a single one was ignored. The balance is phenomenal.

**Neko**<br>
Yes, I agree! Back during the performance, there are multiple times where NEKO was thinking whether to join the circle pit or not! But it feels kinda scary...

**Linda**<br>
Haha, NEKO you're too crazy. I personally prefer sitting in the back rows and focus on listening to the music.<br>
Ah, but I noticed something. Don't you feel like his arrangments are quite similar to CP's previous works? Particularly the guitar solo sections.

**Neko**<br>
Now that Linda\-chan mentions it... they do sound a bit similar! You noticed this immediately, that's amazing! Hardcore fan indeed!

**Linda**<br>
Don't flatter me like that, I'll get flustered...<br>
... However, you're right about me being a hardcore fan. I miss CP so much.

*\[Ringtone\]*

**Linda**<br>
Ah, you have a call...

**Neko**<br>
Ugh...

*\[Phone shutting down\]*

**Linda**<br>
NEKO... that was your dad, right?

**Neko**<br>
Yeah, but NEKO doesn't want to answer it. Stupid daddy...

**Linda**<br>
... You guys got into an argument again? Did something happen recently...?

**Neko**<br>
......<br>
Linda\-chan... Sorry about this, but can I sleep at your house tonight? If I go back now, we're just gonna resume arguing again.

**Linda**<br>
......<br>
You can, but just to give you a heads\-up, my bed is a single bed. <br>
Well, since you're so small, we should be able to fit inside...

**Neko**<br>
Thank you...

**Linda**<br>
Also, you should still send them a message telling them about this, right?

**Neko**<br>
Yes...<br>
Thank you, Linda\-chan. I'm so grateful to know you! Lend me your clothes, NEKO needs to wipe off her tears. Wahhhh...

**Linda**<br>
Haha, stop it. Your fake crying is so bad.<br>
Let's go.
