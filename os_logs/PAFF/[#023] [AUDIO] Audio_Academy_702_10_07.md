**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Aroma\-chan~ Hurry, hurry!

**PAFF**<br>
So nostalgic... I haven't returned to the Academy since I graduated.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Stop dazing off. There are students everywhere. We need to keep a low profile.<br>
Now, listen up. In a minute, NEKO will lure the people as well as the drones away. When nobody is watching, Aroma\-chan will sneak into the Library and find what you are looking for.

**PAFF**<br>
This... Is this really ok? NEKO, wouldn't you get in trouble or something...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
No worries. At worst, I get a few points deducted from my conduct score! NEKO is supposed to be the Chaos Maker\-type streamer after all. Everyone is used to my shticks already!<br>
This way, Aroma\-chan can find clues about that Iris Bagle safely.

**PAFF**<br>
T, thank you... It's Baker...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Alrighty! Operation START!

*\[Footsteps\]*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Hheellllllooo everyone~ NEKO desu! Today, we are streaming at the Academy, where NEKO takes classes! You guys must be super curious, right? Although I don't have class today, let's get going! Ahahahaha!

**Student A**<br>
Hey, isn't that NEKO outside?

**Student B**<br>
No kidding! It's the real deal! Is she going to stream here!? WOAH!

**[Teaching Drone]**<br>
*Warning! Suspicious activity noticed. Miss Neko Asakura, it is class time now. Please stop the ruckus.<br>
Fellow students, please return to your classrooms and your seats...*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Everyone, check this out. This is the drone the Academy uses to manage students. All it does is act mad and give out warnings while running around in circles like this. Isn't it cute?

**Student C**<br>
Outta my way, dumb drone. As a member of the wildcat religion, I must record the sight of our prophet and spread this footage of hope to the whole world...

**Student D**<br>
What the f\*\*\* are you talking about... Ma waifu! Please gimme your autograph!

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Hahaha! You guys are so passionate! Then come with NEKO!

*\[Screams\]*

**PAFF**<br>
I, incredible...

**[Library System]**<br>
*Greetings, user. The fully\-automatic search system is now ready. What information would you like to inquire today?*

**PAFF**<br>
......

**PAFF**<br>
I want to look up... the yearbook for this Academy's class of 685.

**[Library System]**<br>
*Searching... Complete.<br>

Activating virtual projection for you now.*

*[»»» Fast Forward »»»]*

**PAFF**<br>
Found it. This is me...... And......<br>
...... Iris!

**[Library System]**<br>
*System confirmation...... Complete.<br>
Target name: Iris Baker, this Academy's class of 685.*

**PAFF**<br>
Thank goodness. Iris is real... so is this part of my memory...

**PAFF**<br>
Umm, could you tell me Iris's phone number?

**[Library System]**<br>
*Action suspended. Apologies.<br>

**PAFF**<br>
Ah, so you can't tell me... Makes sense.<br>
... What should I do? I thought I could at least get her contact information...

**PAFF**<br>
... At least I confirmed that I do indeed remember Iris.
