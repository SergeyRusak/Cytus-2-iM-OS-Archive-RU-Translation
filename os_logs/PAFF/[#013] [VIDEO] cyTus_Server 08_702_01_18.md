**Aroma**<br>
Ugh...

**Helena**<br>
What's wrong? Are you not feeling well?

**Aroma**<br>
A little... I don't really like to use cyTus...

**Helena**<br>
Could it be that you're too tired these days? Do you want to log out for a short while?

**Aroma**<br>
No, I can manage this...

**Helena**<br>
I'll get Chris to update the connection equipment. Sighs... I wish that guy can tighten up his screw sometimes...

**Aroma**<br>
It's okay... it's almost my turn, right?

**Helena**<br>
ROBO\_Head's set is ending soon. He has put on quite the show. The atmosphere is really hyped up. It's up to you now! Before Æsir takes the stage, let the audience revel in your singing.

**Aroma**<br>
So Æsir still hasn't shown up?

**Helena**<br>
Yeah, but he is communicating with the on\-site staff regularly. He has confirmed that he'll show up at the designated time. He probably wants to make a grand entrance that catches everyone by surprise!<br>
Independent creators love this type of unorthodox approach.

**Aroma**<br>
He's not here for the rehearsal either...

*\[Loud cheers\]*

**Aroma**<br>
Wow... So many people...

**Helena**<br>
Indeed, A part of this crowd is your most devoted fans. It seems that ROBO\_Head's performance has concluded.

*\[System notification\]*

**[Staff A]**<br>
*Excuse me. Miss PAFF, it's about time.*

**Helena**<br>
Is the intro video playing already? How are the effects?

**[Staff B]**<br>
*Footage is playing normally. Light arrangement is confirmed as well. All set and ready to go.<br>
90 seconds until Miss PAFF takes the stage.<br>
We are a professional virtual LIVE operation team. Please rest assured!*

**Aroma**<br>
Thanks for the hard work.

**[Staff B]**<br>
*Oh my god... Did you hear that!? PAFF just said "Thanks for the hard work" to me! I'm so touched! My profession switch to this is all worth it!*

**Helena**<br>
Hey, where's your professionalism?

**[Staff A]**<br>
*Ahem... Apologies for what just happened. He was too excited.<br>
Miss PAFF, please stand inside the red circle. Once the video ends, we'll directly teleport you onto the stage.*

**Helena**<br>
Got it. We'll be in your care.<br>
Aroma, don't be nervous! Fight!

**Aroma**<br>
Yes.

*\[Teleport\]*

*\[Music and cheers\]*
