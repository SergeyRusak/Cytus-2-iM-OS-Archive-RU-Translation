*\[Data Input\]*

**[Nora]**<br>
*...... As expected, the virus' activity in your body has begun to change. This is all new data that hasn't been recorded.*

**PAFF**<br>
Is that... a good thing or a bad thing?

**[Nora]**<br>
*I'm unable to make a decision at this time. Your body is currently not showing any abnormalities, but the fact that we were able to observe this many unexpected phenomena is already far beyond my expectations.*

**PAFF**<br>
……

**[Nora]**<br>
*If you continue to use the ability, it may cause other growths or abnormalities in the virus. By that time, I'm afraid that my experience won't be of much help anymore. You will be on your own.*

**PAFF**<br>
Nora... I've already been here for a long time, yet I still feel like I have no idea what you're talking about. What exactly is this virus...?

**[Nora]**<br>
*That's normal. Humanity... including people like Phoenix and I, have researched this for decades and are still unable to come up with any results. It's very unlikely that ordinary people can understand it in such a short period of time. Forgive me, I've been burying myself in my research non\-stop and forgot to consider your feelings. I think I can try to explain some basic concepts.*

**PAFF**<br>
No need to apologize! Please.

**[Nora]**<br>
*Calling what's known as "The Ender" a virus is merely a habit of custom. Actually, this definition is not entirely correct. This misunderstanding was created by the people who first discovered it, which was based on the actions and symptoms that were observed. In reality, The Ender is entirely different from any other organism that is identified as a virus in nature. This was the biggest discovery of Phoenix's research.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*The formation of The Ender consists of unnatural elements. This allowed us to deduce that it is an artificial item. Categorizing it as a type of "nano\-organism" may be more accurate. Its internal structure is much more complicated than what modern science understands. That includes using signals similar to the virtual internet to link to each other and act as their primary mechanism of communication.*

**PAFF**<br>
Virtual internet...

**[Nora]**<br>
*That's right. We all know that this is something left behind by ancient civilization, I won't dive into too much detail. In conclusion, it's very likely that this is some sort of technology made by humans back then that was based on the virtual internet. However, this technology went out of control.*

**PAFF**<br>
……!<br>
You're saying that humans of the ancient civilization...

**[Nora]**<br>
*Were destroyed when this runaway technology came back to bite them.*

**PAFF**<br>
A disaster of this scale... weren't there any survivors?

**[Nora]**<br>
*I believe there are. People who weren't completely crippled—— there may even be people like us who were immune to the virus, were pretty much guaranteed to exist based on the size of the population at that time. However, that all occurred hundreds of years ago. It's almost impossible to confirm this. Nothing reliable there. Regarding this disaster and the subsequent terrifying situation humans were left in, I'm afraid only our ancestors would know.*

**PAFF**<br>
... So, even to this day, it's difficult to find someone who's immune?

**[Nora]**<br>
*After Phoenix found me, he carried out countless research on my genes. He even researched my biological parents' genetic material, but came up with nothing. As I said, in terms of their definitions, The Ender and ordinary viruses are completely different.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*The Ender... although it's hard to believe, I think that it has something resembling self\-consciousness, that it uses to "filter" their hosts. Yet their conditions, action patterns... and even their motives cannot be known due to a sheer lack of samples.*

**PAFF**<br>
There's no way to understand it from a scientific perspective...?

**[Nora]**<br>
*Though I don't want to admit it... yes. With the current level of scientific expertise and the knowledge we have, we still can't understand it. It's just like the existence of the OS space. All I can say is that no matter how much we believe science and technology have progressed, it's nothing near what humans had during the days of the ancient civilization.*

**[Operating System]**<br>
*Data analysis complete*

**[Nora]**<br>
*The results are in. Look, as soon as it enters the brain, it's unable to be observed physically. All we can do is use these unique internal brain signals to determine The Ender's actions.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*Looks like they're active again. What do you think? Should we try?*

**PAFF**<br>
Of course! First, let's find where Xenon's gone to.

**[Nora]**<br>
*Well then, please begin.*

**PAFF**<br>
……<br>
Success! I've connected to the surveillance devices in the city. The signal is very clear... eh? That's strange?

**[Nora]**<br>
*What is it?*

**PAFF**<br>
So many devices, they're all broken...? I can't get any visuals. It's like I'm being disrupted by something. It's just a few. The rest is fine.

**[Nora]**<br>
*……<br>
Please give me the model number and location of those that have issues.*

**PAFF**<br>
Got it!

*[»»»Fast Forward»»»]*

**[Nora]**<br>
*I see...*

**PAFF**<br>
Did you find anything?

**[Nora]**<br>
*I mapped those devices out... looks like they've malfunctioned in order, under particular conditions... some kind of moving entity——or person.*

**PAFF**<br>
......!

**[Nora]**<br>
*These devices' program has been altered. They've been attacked via their facial recognition functions. The only one who can do this... I would guess it's Mr. Jackson. He's giving away precisely what he hopes to hide. So long as we can organize the time and position of these malfunctioned devices, we'll be able to locate him.<br>
... I just hope we're not too late.*

**PAFF**<br>
Let's contact NEKO right away! She's in the city. We can tell her to check these places out.

**[Nora]**<br>
*Let's do that.*
