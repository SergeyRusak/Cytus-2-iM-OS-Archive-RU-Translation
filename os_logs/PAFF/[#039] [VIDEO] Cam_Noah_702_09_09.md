**Noah**<br>
... Why are you still awake?

**Helena**<br>
......

**Noah**<br>
Helena?

**Helena**<br>
... Yeah. Sorry, I was thinking about something.

**Noah**<br>
You... Why did you start smoking again?

**Helena**<br>
......

**Noah**<br>
... Smoke outside. You don't want Aroma to smell the cigarette smoke.

**Helena**<br>
... (Exhales)... She isn't willing to accept any work these days. I'm trying to figure out a way to handle that.

**Noah**<br>
......

**Helena**<br>
Noah... I...

**Noah**<br>
......?

**Helena**<br>
I don't think I... can bear it anymore...

**Noah**<br>
......<br>
You should ask someone else in the company to take over your job. You're burning the candle at both ends.

**Helena**<br>
No, it's not about my job.

**Noah**<br>
......?

**Helena**<br>
After the 7th anniversary concert, her speech and actions have become stranger and stranger... She sings melodies she's never heard of and reminisces about foreign sceneries. She even constantly asks me questions that never belong to her memory in the first place... You know what I'm saying, right?

**Noah**<br>
Helena, you...

**Helena**<br>
The memories that originally exist in that body...

**Noah**<br>
Shhh! That's enough talk on this topic.

**Helena**<br>
Why... Stop deceiving yourself! Noah! Your experiment was not successful at all!

**Noah**<br>
... What are you talking about? Aren't you the one who insisted that I stop back then? We had it! We had a really good shot at bringing back Aroma for real! The fact that we stopped at that half\-a\*\*ed state is why...

**Helena**<br>
Then did you want me to just watch as you continued on with that ridiculous experiment!? You know very well yourself that bringing Aroma back was asking the impossible! It's all because of you that we're in this hole now...

**Noah**<br>
Because of me!? If not for me, your younger sister would already be dead!

**Helena**<br>
THAT'S NOT MY SISTER!!

**Helena**<br>
Ummm...!

**Noah**<br>
Keep your voice down! She'll hear us!

**Helena**<br>
......!

**Noah**<br>
I... For the past few years, I've continued to conduct this research for her sake. I also collected a lot of new data from her stabilizers. I still haven't given up on the possibility of resetting her memory and turning her into the real Aroma.

**Helena**<br>
... But if we do that...

**Noah**<br>
That's right. There's a possibility that her memory of these past seven years she spent with us will disappear as well. This is a risk we cannot avoid, and it's also why I couldn't make up my mind. <br>
In these seven years, although things were tough for her, it certainly has given her some very happy memories too.

**Helena**<br>
......

**Noah**<br>
Regardless, there is no turning back for us. From now on, no matter what decision we make, we can only face it together... However, one thing remains unchanged. We must let her live on. Not knowing anything, and not needing to shoulder anything. Just live on happily. Don't you agree?

**Helena**<br>
... I don't know anymore... To save her, we erased a living person from existence, and at this very moment, that person clearly still exists within her body.<br>
Sometimes, when I look into her eyes... I see that "other" girl. This guilt... I have no idea what can even be considered happiness to "them" anymore.

**Noah**<br>
Helena, we need to focus on "Aroma". She's the most important one. I believe that we'll have to make a decision in the very near future...

**Helena**<br>
... We have one more option.

**Noah**<br>
......?

**Helena**<br>
Tell her.

**Noah**<br>
Eh?

**Helena**<br>
Tell her. Tell her everything. Let her decide what she'll do herself... even if she despises us because of it. I know this sounds a bit irresponsible, but I believe that this is the correct thing to do.

**Noah**<br>
... I'll... consider it...
