**[Helena]**<br>
*Who is it?*

**Iris**<br>
Sis Helena, it's been a while. This is Iris.<br>
We want to talk to Aroma. Is she home right now?

**[Helena]**<br>
*... One moment.*

**Daniel**<br>
......

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Helena**<br>
Oh, Daniel, you're here as well.

**Iris**<br>
Yeah, been quite some time since my last visit. Is Aroma home?

**Helena**<br>
Hmm... Aroma can't meet with you guys now. If there's anything you want to inform her, just tell me. I'll pass it on to her.

**Iris**<br>
Can't meet with us? Is she not feeling well?

**Helena**<br>
No, she is very healthy. It's just...

**Daniel**<br>
......

**Daniel**<br>
That's her singing... She's practicing in her room?

**Helena**<br>
Yes. Her performance is right around the corner. Therefore...

**Iris**<br>
We want to talk to her about the graduation trip. It won't take too long. After all, she's been absent from the Academy's classes recently too...

**Helena**<br>
The graduation trip? Unfortunately... I don't think Aroma will be able to participate.

**Daniel**<br>
She can't even go to the graduation trip?

**Helena**<br>
Yes. I also act as her agent now. I've been working with Mono to organize Aroma's schedule... I really want her to participate in the Academy's events too, but she just doesn't have any spare time left...

**Iris**<br>
Then, the reason why she doesn't answer her phone these days is also...

**Helena**<br>
Uh\-huh. The company requested me to get her a new number. This is to avoid any inappropriate interactions or rumors before her debut... It would throw a wrench into the promotional campaign for her idol image.

**Daniel**<br>
Tch, all this company, idol, agent bullcrap... Aroma! You're in there, right? Show yourself!

**Iris**<br>
... Daniel! Stop that...

**Helena**<br>
... Right now is an important time period for Aroma. Her schedule is very tight. For her sake, please don't bother her when she's practicing.

**Daniel**<br>
Not even a few words?

**Helena**<br>
I will tell her that you guys came. Please, just give her some more time.

**Daniel**<br>
... Hmph, I'm leaving.

*\[Footsteps\]*

**Helena**<br>
I'm really sorry, Iris.

**Iris**<br>
W, wait! Sis Helena!

**Helena**<br>
What's the matter?

**Iris**<br>
I would like sis Helena to tell Aroma that...<br>
After graduation... I'm moving away.

**Helena**<br>
Moving away? Why all of a sudden?

**Iris**<br>
Due to my father's job, we'll be living in Node 19 permanently... It's very likely that we'll never return to 08 again.

**Helena**<br>
I see... what a shame.

**Iris**<br>
If possible, please tell Aroma...

**Iris**<br>
No matter what, we... will always be best friends... *\*Sobs\**...

**Helena**<br>
......

**Helena**<br>
... Understood. I will pass that message to her. You should go home now. It's getting late.

**Iris**<br>
Yes... Thank you, sis Helena.

*\[Door Closes\]*

**Helena**<br>
......

**Helena**<br>
Don't think about it... I did the right thing.

**Helena**<br>
I have to... protect Aroma no matter the cost...
