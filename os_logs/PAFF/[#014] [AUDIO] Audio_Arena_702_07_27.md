**Helena**<br>
Sir, is the makeup done? It's almost time.

**Stylist**<br>
Ooh, nice timing you got there, Helena. I just finished.

**Helena**<br>
Is that so? Let me take a look... Woah, your skills are as impressive as always. Every angle is perfect.

**Stylist**<br>
Haha, no matter how skilled I am, makeup is never perfect on its own. If not for Miss PAFF's flawless appearance, I couldn't have done such a great makeup either.

**Aroma**<br>
That's not the case... Thank you, sir.

**Stylist**<br>
You're welcome\~ Since this is a rare physical concert, I'll be at the VIP section. I'll be here when you need to reapply your makeup.

**Helena**<br>
We'll be in your care.

**Helena**<br>
Aroma, the performance is about to start very soon. How's everything going? Do you feel any discomfort?

**Aroma**<br>
I'm feeling fine... No need to worry.

**Helena**<br>
Thank goodness. Even though the stabilizers have had fewer issues since Noah optimized them, I still don't want you to force yourself...

**[Tuner-san]**<br>
*Aroma's feeling well! Feeling well!*

**Aroma**<br>
See. No problem at all.

**Helena**<br>
I see.

**Aroma**<br>
Hmm...

**Helena**<br>
... Come on, today is your big day! You're looking way too gloomy! Smile... Here, I'll help you out.

**Aroma**<br>
Ahahaha... Aww, sister, that tickles... Hehe!

**Helena**<br>
Haha, you need to relax to have a good performance. Everything is set. It's up to you put on a show!

**Aroma**<br>
Of course. However... I want to focus and go through the lyrics one more time.

**Helena**<br>
No problem. I have to pay a visit to the backstage to see how the preparation is going. When the time arrives, I'll notify you through the broadcast.

**Aroma**<br>
Understood.

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Aroma**<br>
... Hmm... Tuner\-san, play the accompanying music for me.

**[Tuner-san]**<br>
*《Gravity》instrumental, start!*

*\[Accompanying music\]*

**Aroma**<br>
\*I spy overlying wings swing as I fly<br>
Beneath the old moon's ray, when the starlights sway...\*

*\[Stabilizer warning\]*

**Aroma**<br>
......Ugh......

**Aroma**<br>
Why... is my head starting to hurt again...<br>
It has been fine recently...

**Aroma**<br>
......

**Aroma**<br>
No, I can't let sister and others worry about me...<br>
It's not that serious. I can do this...

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

**[Helena]**<br>
*Aroma... No, "Miss PAFF", it is time. Please come to the backstage for final preparations.*<br>
The night of your 7th Anniversary is about to begin.

**Aroma**<br>
Sister...

**Aroma**<br>
... I'll be right there.
