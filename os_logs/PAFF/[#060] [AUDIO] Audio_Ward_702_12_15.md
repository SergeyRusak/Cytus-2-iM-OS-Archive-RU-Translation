**PAFF**<br>
NEKO? Where are you going!?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
... Home...

**Hayato**<br>
Hey! NEKO!

**[Nora]**<br>
*Let her go. Daigo, make sure someone's escorting her. At least make sure she arrives home safely.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*Just as Miss Asakura said, this place can't be considered safe anymore. I underestimated the enemy's ability and put my guests through this kind of risk... I'm no longer qualified to make a promise for your safety. From now on, you don't have to stay here anymore. *

**PAFF**<br>
Then Xenon...

**[Nora]**<br>
*I'll use my ability to figure out where he is. I really hope he won't do anything stupid...*

**PAFF**<br>
Let me do it!

**[Nora]**<br>
*I already said; I'll figure out a way to continue the investigation. You guys are no longer required to run the risk of staying here.*

**PAFF**<br>
Yes, we are.

**[Nora]**<br>
*Miss PAFF, I understand your feelings, but...*

**PAFF**<br>
Nora, you're... not by yourself anymore. We're all here, okay?

**Hayato**<br>
You see those eyes? Once she shows this expression, there's no way you're going to persuade her to give up.<br>
Nora, even though I may not be of much help, we're all willing to stay here to continue to search for the truth.

**Nora**<br>
......

**PAFF**<br>
Xenon... the stupid things you just mentioned... Could he be...

**Member D**<br>
I'm afraid that he's on his way to track down Diego's whereabouts. With the state he is in right now, we can't expect him to make a sensible decision.

**[Nora]**<br>
*We have to locate him as soon as possible. The incident this time, I'm afraid it isn't as simple as he thinks.*

**PAFF**<br>
I... I think I can use the surveillance cameras in the city to find his location.

**[Nora]**<br>
*You want to give it a shot? Judging by the time he left, the area he can cover has, at minimum, thousands of surveillance cameras in it. *

**PAFF**<br>
Yes! I'll try my best.

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

**PAFF**<br>
......<br>
Hmm... eh? That's strange...

**Hayato**<br>
What's the matter?

**PAFF**<br>
It seems that... I'm kept out of OS again. I can't use my ability...

**Nora**<br>
......

**Hayato**<br>
How come? Didn't you just use your ability to open the door?

**[Nora]**<br>
*......? Open the door...?<br>
Speaking of which, how were you guys able to get here sooner than I did...*

**PAFF**<br>
Yes. We were stuck in the room back there. At first, I just wanted to take a look at the situation outside, but all the surveillance cameras in the facility stopped functioning. Just when I was about to give up, I saw that the backup power for the door lock was still functioning... Then the door opened itself.

**[Nora]**<br>
*......!!<br>
I did remind you not to use your ability without informing me first... However, if you indeed accomplish such a feat, then this is a major discovery.*

**Hayato**<br>
Nora, you can't do this?

**[Nora]**<br>
*The most I can do is read the information in OS. Miss PAFF, on the other hand, is able to manipulate the devices in its internet space. This shows a clear difference between our abilities.*

**PAFF**<br>
......

**[Nora]**<br>
*Looks like more experiments and tests are necessary to figure out the details, including why you're suddenly unable to use your ability now.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*All in all, both of you should be exhausted. I am very thankful that you're still willing to stay here. Please get some rest. I must now go back to clean up this mess.*

*\[Wheelchair moving\]*

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Hayato**<br>
Nora's expressions... they feel different than what they usually are.

**PAFF**<br>
It was because she couldn't make the decision to sacrifice ROBO that led to... Although that was in no way her fault, she couldn't help but blame herself...

**Hayato**<br>
*\*Sniff\**... Never thought Miss Cherry would be gone just like that...

*\[Ringtone\]*

**Hayato**<br>
Who would call...? NEKO!?

*[Signal Lost]*
