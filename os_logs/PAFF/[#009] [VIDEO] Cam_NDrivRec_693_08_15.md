**Helena**<br>
The car is here.

**PAFF**<br>
Yes...

**Helena**<br>
... Aroma, what did you promised me?

**PAFF**<br>
That I would enjoy singing and enjoy the stage. Bring power to everyone in the world...

**Helena**<br>
That's right. We will always be there for you. Here, get in the car.

**[Tuner-san]**<br>
*Warning! This vehicle does not comply with the safety standards. Confirm to ride?*

**Helena**<br>
You still haven't fixed the seatbelt yet?

**Noah**<br>
Ah, crap... I've been too busy lately; didn't have time to fix it. Sorry... We only have three people though; we can just avoid that seat. Helena, how about you take the front passenger seat?

**Helena**<br>
No, I'm sitting with Aroma in the back.<br>
Aroma, you sit over there. I'll sit in the broken seat.

**PAFF**<br>
Sister... isn't that dangerous?

**[Tuner-san]**<br>
*Danger! Danger!*

**Helena**<br>
Mono is just a short drive away, no big deal. Scoot over.

**Noah**<br>
Hey, with this seating arrangement, I'm practically a "Ciber Driver" now...

**Helena**<br>
What? You got something to say? If something happens to me, blame yourself for being so incapable that you couldn't fix a seatbelt.

**Noah**<br>
Stop jinxing yourself... Let's go.

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

**Helena**<br>
Don't you have to work today?

**Noah**<br>
I asked for a day off. This is PAFF's first performance after all; how could I miss it? I'm the man that's going to be her no.1 fan.

**Helena**<br>
Ewww... gross. If her fans are like you, things are going to be troubling. They may even harass the idol... right, Aroma?

**PAFF**<br>
Eh!? ... Ah, yeah...

**Helena**<br>
What's the matter? Are you still nervous?

**Noah**<br>
......

*\[Ringtone\]*

**Helena**<br>
Ah, it's from Chris.

**[Chris]**<br>
*Hi\~ Just calling in for a quick reminder. Practice starts at 10.*

**Helena**<br>
Got it. We are already on our way.

**[Chris]**<br>
*Is PAFF there?*

**Helena**<br>
She's right next to me. However, it seems like she's still a bit anxious...

**[Chris]**<br>
*Oh, I see. Can I talk to her for a bit?*

**Helena**<br>
OK. Aroma, it's Chris.
