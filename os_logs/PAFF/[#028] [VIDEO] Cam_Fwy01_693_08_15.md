**Noah**<br>
Umm... ughh...

**Noah**<br>
What... happened...

**Noah**<br>
Aro... ma... Are you... alright...

**Rescue Team Captain**<br>
Hey, Sir! Can you hear me?

**Noah**<br>
Uhhhh...

**Rescue Team Captain**<br>
He fainted... Looks like his injuries are not life\-threatening.<br>
Hey, carry him to the medical station. Be careful not to shake his head.

**Team Member A**<br>
He's the driver of that car, right? All the windows are shattered. He probably got lucky and was flung out of the car. That's why he didn't suffer serious injuries... The lady next to him too...

**Team Member B**<br>
Man, he sure got lucky... Just look at the car... or what's left of it.

**Team Member A**<br>
An energy vehicle exploded right next to them. It's truly a miracle that they managed to survive that.

**Rescue Team Captain**<br>
Enough with the dumb remarks. Better start cleaning up this mess.

*\[Hurried Footsteps\]*

**Team Member C**<br>
C... captain!

**Rescue Team Captain**<br>
What's wrong?

**Team Member C**<br>
T, that car... someone's still in it!

**Rescue Team Captain**<br>
WHAT?

**Team Member C**<br>
It's a girl... she's stuck inside!

*\[Hurried Footsteps\]*

**Rescue Team Captain**<br>
... She... this girl...

**Team Member A**<br>
Oh my god... Her head...

**Team Member B**<br>
She's still breathing! But she's unconscious... Captain!

**Rescue Team Captain**<br>
... We can't get to her this way. Call the drones. We're gonna pry open the car roof!

**Team Member B**<br>
Y, yes sir!

**Rescue Team Captain**<br>
You, inform the medical station. Tell them that a GCS 3 patient with serious injuries is coming their way. Ask them to prepare the nano\-healing equipment. We need to stabilize her condition ASAP!

**Team Member A**<br>
On it!

*\[Hurried Footsteps\]*

**Team Member C**<br>
How ironic... Her seatbelt was the only one that didn't break, which in turn secured her tightly to her seat... A device that generally saves lives ended up harming hers...

**Rescue Team Captain**<br>
It's pointless to say such things now. Go get more people. We need all the help we can get.

**Team Member C**<br>
Understood...

*\[Hurried Footsteps\]*

**Rescue Team Captain**<br>
... You probably don't know this, but I've seen the video of you singing on the internet... Your singing was beautiful.

**Rescue Team Captain**<br>
......

**Rescue Team Captain**<br>
Please... hang in there.
