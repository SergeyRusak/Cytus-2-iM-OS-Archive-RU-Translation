**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Whew\~ Haha\~ Today's stream was AWESOME. The viewers were all hyped!

**PAFF**<br>
Is it really alright...? Your conduct score must've taken quite the hit, right? That was a pretty big ruckus you caused back there...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
No problemo\~ NEKO enrolled in a few extra credit seminars at the end of the semester. It should be just enough to cover my deducted points\~ I think? Probably?

**PAFF**<br>
......

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
What's the matter? Not feeling well?

**PAFF**<br>
Eh? No... It's just... I think you're amazing. You always seem so energetic.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
The heck is that\~ NEKO may seem this way, but there's still stuff I worry about...

**PAFF**<br>
Is that so? I've always felt like NEKO is such a strong person. It's as if there is no hardship you can't overcome.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Hehe\~? I'm not that ... haha.<br>
... Ah, by the way, Aroma\-chan, do you know about Xenon?

**PAFF**<br>
Yes. I've heard his music on iM. He's the really amazing guitarist, right?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Hoho, if he hears those words he'll be so darn happy that even his poker face can't hide it! He's a huge fan of yours too!

**PAFF**<br>
Eh? Really? Haha... Why did you mention him all of a sudden?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Hmm? Oh, umm, nothing. Just kinda popped into my mind.

**PAFF**<br>
... Are NEKO's worries related to him?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
HA!? EHH!? N, no it's not! Why did you ask such a question!? Ahahaha!

**PAFF**<br>
No... I just made a random guess. I'm sorry...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Well... No matter what kind of worries NEKO have, compare to your messed up memory issues, they're practically child's play.

**PAFF**<br>
Ah... No, I didn't mean to...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
It's not your problem at all. It's more NEKO being too normal. Haha!

**PAFF**<br>
Yeah...<br>
However, seeing you get along with your fans... It looks like so much fun. I'm a little bit envious...

*\[Lightly slaps face\]*

**PAFF**<br>
Wah!?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Aroma\-chan... PAFF's singing has always given everyone strength too, hasn't it? How are you gonna do that if you're so dejected yourself? Cheer up!

**PAFF**<br>
Yes...

*\[Eat snacks\]*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
*\*Chewing\**... Setting these things aside, how did the search go? The one for your classmate's info.

**PAFF**<br>
Ah... I wasn't able to find an address... but there is indeed a person named Iris. I was also able to remember her more clearly!

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Really? Isn't that great!?

**PAFF**<br>
Yes! I saved a few photographs and brought them out with me. All these classmates are people I remember. Tuner\-san!

**[Tuner-san]**<br>
*Project saved photo files.*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Ho\~? Ah, so this is that Iris person? She's a really cute girl too...

**PAFF**<br>
Yes... what a shame. If only I could find her address...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Who's the person next to her?

**PAFF**<br>
I think it's her younger brother... I recall that everyone had to turn in a few photos taken together with family members.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Then it's very possible that this photo is taken somewhere near her home, isn't it?

**PAFF**<br>
Hmm... I'm not certain. Besides, I don't recognize this place either...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Hmmm... this place... NEKO finds it a bit familiar for some reason\~

**PAFF**<br>
Eh? For real?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Uh\-huh\~ Hmm\~\~ Ah! Isn't this the streets around "Mountain Breeze Musique"! NEKO knows this place!

**PAFF**<br>
Mountain Breeze Musique...?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Right here! Enlarge the photo. You can see the store sign here, right?

**PAFF**<br>
Wow, you're right.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Let's go and check out this road in the photo tomorrow. Maybe you can remember something there!

**PAFF**<br>
... Okay!
