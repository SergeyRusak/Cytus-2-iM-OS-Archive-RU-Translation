**Hayato**<br>
I'm back. Sighs\~ I'm exhausted...

**Susan**<br>
Thanks for the hard work. Another major news story?

**Hayato**<br>
Ummm... You know, those things... any case that sis Vicky ignores usually falls on to my shoulders...

**Vicky**<br>
Somebody calling me?

**Hayato**<br>
Wah! Sis Vicky! Welcome back!

**Susan**<br>
Pfft, look at you. Be careful with what you say! Sis Vicky's nose exist to smell out gossip!

**Vicky**<br>
That's right! Call me the gossip queen Vicky!

**Vicky**<br>
I was finally able to find it! Hayato! Great job!

**Hayato**<br>
Eh? Did I do anything...?

**Vicky**<br>
Hmph... You took care of those worthless news stories for me, which gave me the time to investigate this big one!

**Hayato**<br>
......

**Vicky**<br>
This is exclusive stuff! I know where PAFF is!

**Hayato**<br>
Eh!? For real? Where!?

**Vicky**<br>
Take a look! This is the VOD of a NEKO stream on iM a while ago!

**[Video]**<br>
*Meow meow meow (ΦωΦ)/ I'm bored so let's stream\~<br>
Heard that many of you are VERY\~ interested in NEKO's room aren't ya\~\~\~ (\*Φ∀Φ)*

**Susan**<br>
This clip... it's just a stream of her room though? Is something wrong with it?

**Vicky**<br>
Tch tch tch, you young folks are too naive! Even though it's just one second... but if you enlarge this part! Look!<br>
What is this!?

**Hayato**<br>
Umm... I don't really see anything special...

**Vicky**<br>
Tuner\-san! This is the part on Tuner\-san's head! Almost no one uses Tuner\-san now! Who's the only person you can think of that uses Tuner\-san? PAFF! She is definitely hiding in NEKO's home!

**Susan**<br>
Umm... I know sis Vicky is amazing, but isn't the reasoning this time a bit too flimsy...? We're not even certain that PAFF had Tuner\-san with her when she disappeared... Besides, many people still use Tuner\-san right now. Not to mention that NEKO is a popular streamer; it could just be another gift from a sponsor...

**Vicky**<br>
Idiot! This thing went out of production a long time ago! Besides, with NEKO's personality, do you really think she would ever not show off a gift she got?

**Hayato**<br>
......

**Vicky**<br>
... Fine, so you guys are still not persuaded? Then I'll present you my trump care! Look!

*\[Items scattered\]*

**Susan**<br>
Yikes! That stinks! What are these, sis Vicky!?

**Vicky**<br>
Trash! From NEKO's house.

**Hayato**<br>
HAA!?!? Are you serious...

**Vicky**<br>
Check out these purchase records! In this day and age, nobody uses paper\-based purchase records anymore! She went as far as asking the seller to give her a paper receipt that doesn't leave a record; this itself is super suspicious! I can smell it; she is buying things in secret!

**Susan**<br>
You're exaggerating...

**Vicky**<br>
Look at these! Shampoo, body soap! Judging by the time, the ones she bought before should still have plenty left. Yet she went ahead and bought a different brand! Look at the size of these clothes... all signs show that there are more than four people living in the house right now! The consumer name on the records are all NEKO, so she probably hasn't told her family. On top of that, this 32D bra is definitely not NEKO's or Yukiko's! Who else has 32D boobs? That's right! PAFF!

**Hayato**<br>
......

**Vicky**<br>
But wait! There's more! This hair dye is also very suspicious! NEKO asked about this on iM not too long ago. On that post, she said that it's herself who's using it. However, we can see that the whole can is used, yet NEKO's hair color hasn't changed! Therefore, I can make a very bold speculation, that PAFF is currently sporting this light slate grey hair color! To hide herself from the public!

**Hayato**<br>
... What exactly was sis Vicky doing before this job...?

**Susan**<br>
No idea... a private investigator maybe...?

**Vicky**<br>
In short! These clues! They are proof that there's a high possibility of PAFF hiding in NEKO's home! Susan! Come with me this weekend! We're going to set up an ambush at her house! At minimum, we need one or two clear photos!

**Susan**<br>
Eh\~? I can't... I have family business to tend to this weekend...

**Vicky**<br>
Then... Hayato!

**Susan**<br>
Hayato has taken those days off. He has a performance at Under Velvet that night...

**Hayato**<br>
I'll go.

**Susan**<br>
...... Eh? Didn't you get somebody to fill in for you already?

**Vicky**<br>
Hmph, whenever it's news about PAFF, this brat becomes extra motivated.

**Hayato**<br>
......

**Vicky**<br>
Then a decision has been made! BUT, you better not cause me any trouble like you did last time.

**Hayato**<br>
U, understood!
