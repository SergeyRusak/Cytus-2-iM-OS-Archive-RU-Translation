**[Nora]**<br>
*The alarm has been disabled. Everyone, please return to your rooms. This place is not designed to house so many people. The chips we have will interrupt the system's operations.*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Eh~ NEKO wants to stay here with Sis Cherry though...<br>
Can't help it then; let's go to PAFF's room to play some games!

**Hayato**<br>
Why are you so carefree about this whole thing...?

**[Nora]**<br>
*......<br>
Alright. Everyone, leave the room so the treatment process can continue.*

*[→Signal Switches]*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Whew~ It's finally over... That was so scary.

**Hayato**<br>
You sure do recover fast... No one would ever suspect that you were bawling like a child just a few minutes ago.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
I... I did not! I was just a tiny~ bit scared, like what every normal person would be in those circumstances.

**Hayato**<br>
And that "WAAAAHHHHH!" was... quite glorious.

**PAFF**<br>
Hayato! That's too mean.

**Hayato**<br>
Okay, okay; sorry about that...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Yeah, apologize! You stinkin Intern Paparazzi guy!

**Hayato**<br>
Please stop calling me that. I was only doing that job to investigate any information about Kaori. You really think I like doing that stuff...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
No wonder you suck so bad at it and got busted by Xenon almost instantly.

**PAFF**<br>
Hey, hey, stop arguing. You two need to get along with each other!

**Hayato**<br>
Okay...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Kay...

**PAFF**<br>
What's the matter? Why are you two behaving all of a sudden...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Hehe, well, because we're both here for the sake of Aroma\-chan, right?

**Hayato**<br>
Yeah, that's right.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Though Hayato didn't actually do anything. Pffft.

**Hayato**<br>
You... you don't get to talk when you're the same!

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Who said that! NEKO provided Aroma\-chan with both food and shelter when she was wandering around on the streets!

**PAFF**<br>
Sigh... Not even three seconds have past and here we go again...

*\[Lights Off\]*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Eek! What now? Is it bedtime already?

**Hayato**<br>
What? The lights don't turn off even if it's time to sleep, right? Did the power go out?

**PAFF**<br>
I'll go outside to take a look.<br>
Eh? Can't open the door either...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Whaaa... Are we being attacked again!? No...

*\[Kicks Door\]*

**Hayato**<br>
Yikes, this door sure is sturdy... Ouch!

**PAFF**<br>
... Will Miss Cherry and the others be alright?

**Hayato**<br>
......Ah! The life support system!

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
......!<br>
NEKO also heard what Nora\-chan told Xenon! Without power, things will get really dangerous, right!?

**PAFF**<br>
I... I want to use my ability to check the situation outside.

**Hayato**<br>
You sure about that?

**PAFF**<br>
Yes! I'm already very skilled with the training Nora assigned me these past few days. If it's a distance this close...

**PAFF**<br>
......<br>
......!!

**Hayato**<br>
What's the matter? What did you see?

**PAFF**<br>
Nothing... I can't see anything. How come? Does this mean that the entire Kyuu Hou Kai has lost power...?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Sis Cherry is in danger!

**Hayato**<br>
Damnit! We have to go out as soon as possible!<br>
Come on! Open yourself, you big stupid door!

*\[Kicks Door\]*

**PAFF**<br>
Hayato, wait!<br>
I think... I saw something else...

**PAFF**<br>
.. The door... still has power. Maybe it's the backup power source... but the security system has gone offline...

**Hayato**<br>
......?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
What are you talking about...?

**PAFF**<br>
......<br>
...... Hmph!!

*\[Door Opens\]*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
......!?

**Hayato**<br>
Did you do this? How did you...?

**PAFF**<br>
... I... I don't know either.<br>
All I know is that we have to get there as fast as we can!
