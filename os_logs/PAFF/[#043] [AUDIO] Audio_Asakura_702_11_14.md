**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Huff... Puff... Sis Yukiko, quick, open the door!

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Kenta**<br>
Big sister is back!

**Yukiko**<br>
NEKO!

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Finally home... Ah, daddy is here too!

**Kouhei**<br>
I got Yukiko's note about you wanting us to help, so daddy got home from work as soon as possible... Did you get into trouble again?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Nope. Not at all, you dummy. NEKO just...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Argh! This is so irritating. First things first, quick introduction; this is Aroma\-chan!

**PAFF**<br>
H, hello everyone...

**Yukiko**<br>
Ah, are you NEKO's friend? Hello.<br>
Here, Kenta, say hi to her.

**Kenta**<br>
PA......PAPAPAPA

**Kouhei**<br>
Kenta?

**Kenta**<br>
PAFF... It's PAFF

**Yukiko**<br>
What's the matter, Kenta?<br>
... Eh...?

**Kouhei**<br>
This face is really familiar... You...

*\[Things crashing\]*

**Yukiko、Kouhei**<br>
PAFF!???

**PAFF**<br>
Umm, Yes... Apologies for disturbing you...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Sighhh~ I knew this is gonna happen... Welp, can't help it then. Guys, just hear NEKO out first.

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

**Kenta**<br>
It's the real PAFF... the real PAFF...

**Kouhei**<br>
So you've been hiding in NEKO's room all this time. No wonder she always cooks an extra serving of dinner... This is much more serious than keeping a stray cat, you know.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
W, what else can NEKO do!? Aroma\-chan's memory was all messed up and she didn't know who to ask for help. She looked so pitiful! NEKO wants to help her!

**Yukiko**<br>
Kouhei... she does indeed appear to be in bad shape...

**Kouhei**<br>
Alright then... Although I have no idea why you would go missing, my daughter's friend is likely not a bad person.<br>
Rest assured. We won't inform the authorities.

**PAFF**<br>
Thank you... Mr. Asakura.

**Kenta**<br>
It's the real PAFF... the real PAFF...

**Kouhei**<br>
You're welcome.<br>
So, NEKO, about that hiding place you mentioned...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Uh\-huh... It's a bar called "JOEZ Cafe". It's quite a distance from our home. Daddy, can you drive us there?

**Yukiko**<br>
Okay, we will escort Miss PAFF there...

**Kouhei**<br>
We have a slight problem... Yukiko, look outside the window.

**Yukiko**<br>
......!!<br>
What a crowd...

**Kouhei**<br>
You two caused a huge ruckus on iM. Our home address was also posted on there. All those people outside are probably all Miss PAFF's fans. If they discover that Miss PAFF is indeed here, she'll definitely get sent back.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
N, NEKO didn't do it on purpose! We just accidentally got recognized back there! PAFF is way too famous!

**PAFF**<br>
I'm sorry...

**Kenta**<br>
It's the real PAFF... the real PAFF...

**Yukiko**<br>
It's alright, Miss PAFF... Kouhei, looks like the only option now is to drive there.

**Kouhei**<br>
Yes. Everyone, prepare to leave. We're all going. Staying at home alone is not safe right now. I'll go get the car from the garage first. We'll meet up at the backdoor... Miss PAFF, sorry in advance, but you may have to squeeze in with us in our shabby old car.

**PAFF**<br>
T, thank you very much!

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Yukiko**<br>
Here, let's get ready to leave too. NEKO, Kenta, and Miss PAFF... No need to worry. You'll be safe soon.

**PAFF**<br>
Okay... Thank you.

**Kenta**<br>
It's the real PAFF... the real PAFF...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
KENTA! Snap out of it! Put on your shoes, now! If you keep overheating, I'll stick you in the fridge and leave you at home alone!

**PAFF**<br>
Haha...
