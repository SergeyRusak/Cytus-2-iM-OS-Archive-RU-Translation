**Shop Owner**<br>
Helena! Table 3! Stop spacing out!

**Helena**<br>
Ah...! Yes, sir! I'm sorry!

**Shop Owner**<br>
What's the matter with you? You don't seem very focused today. We have a lot of customers on Christmas Eve; get yourself together!

**Helena**<br>
Got it. Sorry...

**Helena**<br>
Apologies for the wait. Here is your order.

**Customer A**<br>
Thanks.

**Helena**<br>
......

**Staff A**<br>
Your younger sister is staying at home by herself. You're concerned about her, aren't you?

**Helena**<br>
... I previously promised that I will spend today with her to celebrate Christmas.

**Staff A**<br>
You should talk to the shop owner. We can handle the rest.

**Helena**<br>
No... I can't do that. This is not an excuse. I will focus on the job!

**Staff B**<br>
Little girl, you can't come in here.

**PAFF**<br>
...... I, I'm looking for my sister...

**Helena**<br>
......?<br>
Aroma!? Why are you here!?

**PAFF**<br>
Because sister hasn't come back for a long time. I was worried...

**Helena**<br>
Sorry, sorry! I even promised that I would spend Christmas with you...

**PAFF**<br>
You didn't even give me a phone call. I thought something bad happened. Thank goodness...

**Helena**<br>
I am so sorry! However, as you can see, we have a lot of customers now. I really can't pull myself away from the line of duty. I don't even have time to make a phone call...

**PAFF**<br>
It's okay. I just want to know that sister is safe. There really are a lot of customers. It is Christmas after all.

**Helena**<br>
Ah... You shouldn't come in here. Go home now. Sister will go back later.

**Shop Owner**<br>
Ho? Isn't this Aroma? Haven't seen you in a long time\~

**PAFF**<br>
G, good evening, sir\~

**Shop Owner**<br>
Good evening. Did you grow taller again?<br>
Hey, arrange a seat for her.

**Helena**<br>
Owner? Is it really okay!?

**Shop Owner**<br>
The routine checks are usually more loose on Christmas Eve. Should be fine.

**Helena**<br>
But...

**Shop Owner**<br>
It was me who asked you to work overtime and prevented you from going home to be with her. Let her stay here. You can be more at ease this way too, right?

**Helena**<br>
Thank you so much!<br>
Aroma, can you sit here and wait for me? My shift is ending very soon.

**PAFF**<br>
Understood. Sister, fight\~

**Shop Owner**<br>
What do you want to drink? Uncle will treat you.

**PAFF**<br>
Then... o, orange juice...
