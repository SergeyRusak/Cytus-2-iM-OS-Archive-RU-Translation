**Helena**<br>
... We're here.

**PAFF**<br>
Sister, are you alright?

**Helena**<br>
Yes. I'm fine now. Sorry...

**PAFF**<br>
It's okay. We cried together. Nothing to apologize for.

**Helena**<br>
No, I'm not talking about that... Everything that has happened until now, all of it... I am terribly sorry... to both of you...

**PAFF**<br>
......<br>
Once I solve the mysteries regarding my body, I will definitely come back... If you believe that it was your fault that I lost some things, I'll just have to go and get those things back. That way, there won't be anything you have to feel sorry for, right?

**Helena**<br>
Aroma...

**PAFF**<br>
For a long time, my sister has always been the one to comfort me and take care of me whenever I feel down. So this time, I'm going to be the one to make sure that you're not sad.

**Helena**<br>
Yes... I'm fine. Do you guys have any plans for what to do next? About that other set of memories in you...

**PAFF**<br>
No... We're only there to stay and hide from the public for a while. NEKO's friend, Mr. Miller, seems to know a lot of things. He may be able to help us.

**Helena**<br>
Node 03.

**PAFF**<br>
Eh?

**Helena**<br>
This is something I heard by chance from Noah and the members of his team. Your current body came from Node 03. You were someone who previously lived in Node 03. 

**Helena**<br>
You said so yourself too, right? That in the memories you were able to recall, there were a lot of images from Node 03. 

**PAFF**<br>
Indeed... That's exactly what I thought too.

**Helena**<br>
You used to be a shy and timid child, but now... you've become strong. I don't know why, but I feel... at ease seeing you like this.<br>
It's time to go.

**PAFF**<br>
Sister, why don't you come with us? We can do this together...

**Helena**<br>
No. Noah may not be able to accept the fact that I took you out without his knowledge. So, I'll stay here and try my best to persuade him. I need to prevent him from doing what he did once more.

**PAFF**<br>
......

**Helena**<br>
Right now, he's really paranoid. Even though I understand that he has his reasons... I believe that your fate should be decided by you. After all, you're no longer just "one person".

**PAFF**<br>
Yes...

**Helena**<br>
Besides, my job as your agent is not over yet. Aroma definitely wants to sing again someday, right? After everything is over, I will make sure that you can still return to the stage and perform! 

**PAFF**<br>
Yes! Sister... I'm so glad; you're finally acting like the sister I always knew. Hehe\~

*\[Hugs\]*

**PAFF**<br>
......!

**Helena**<br>
... You, will always be my little sister.

**PAFF**<br>
Yes.

**PAFF**<br>
Hello...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
...... Aroma\-chan!!!

**PAFF**<br>
Waah!!

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
WAaaaahhhh!! Aroma\-chan, are you alright? Did anyone do anything terrible to you!? You know, umm... that kind of stuff?

**PAFF**<br>
Ummm, I'm alright... what's "that kind of stuff"...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Daddy is so stupid! How can he get drugged like that... NEKO was super worried! WAaaahhh!!

**PAFF**<br>
NEKO... thank you.

**JOE**<br>
Hehe, it really is the super idol herself! Hello\~ I am the owner of JOEZ Cafe. Joe Miller's the name.

**PAFF**<br>
Hello. NEKO mentioned you before... Thank you so much for your help, Mr. Miller.

**JOE**<br>
Haha, no need for that Mister stuff! Just call me JOE. Come, you can get some rest in the basement first. I can swear by Pops' name that this is the safest place available. No one will ever find you here.

**PAFF**<br>
Understood... We'll be in your care.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
NEKO will go down there with you as soon as I finish this drink!

*\[Door Opens\]*

**JOE**<br>
Haven't clean this place in quite a while... Sorry about this. Even I feel kinda bad for letting a super idol stay in such a dusty basement.

**PAFF**<br>
No, not at all. Thank you, Mr. Mill... JOE.

**JOE**<br>
Haha, no big deal! You experienced a lot of crap today, haven't you? Get some rest.<br>
I need to place some orders for the shop first. If you want anything, just press this button. I'll be at your service in no time.

**PAFF**<br>
Understood.

*\[Door Closes\]*

**PAFF**<br>
......

**PAFF**<br>
... This place... it feels a bit familiar for some reason...

**PAFF**<br>
... Ughh... my head...
