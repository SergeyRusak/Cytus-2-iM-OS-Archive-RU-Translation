Aroma...... Aroma？

**PAFF**<br>
... Eh? Sister?<br>
Sorry, I fell asleep...

**Helena**<br>
It's alright. If you're tired, feel free to rest some more.

**[Tuner-san]**<br>
*Notice: 10 minutes until performance~ 10 minutes until performance~*

**Helena**<br>
Ah, looks like you're taking the stage soon.

**PAFF**<br>
Got it. I'll be ready in a minute.

**PAFF**<br>
Ah, it's so cute. Everyone is waiting in Christmas clothes.

**Helena**<br>
Because it's a Christmas event. Aroma, your outfit today is very cute as well.

**PAFF**<br>
Christmas...

**Helena**<br>
What's wrong?

**PAFF**<br>
Nothing. It's just... I think I just had a dream about a time when we were both little...?

**Helena**<br>
Eh? For real!? What did you dream about?

**PAFF**<br>
Hmm... I'm not very certain, but it seems like sister was working part\-time at a piano bar.

**Helena**<br>
Oh, so it's "Heaven Note". Is it a shop with a stage for performances?

**PAFF**<br>
Yes. Now I remember. I think it's Christmas that day as well. I was still a little girl and I visited the shop to see you... I even sang on\-stage later that day.

**Helena**<br>
Yes! This is great news! You remember another thing from your childhood! I have to tell Noah.

**PAFF**<br>
That song... I think it's...

**Helena**<br>
《 Winter Games》, right?

**PAFF**<br>
Yes. I think I still remember how to sing that song.

**PAFF**<br>
... Can I sing this song when I take the stage later? I can't really recall the emotion I was in when I sang it back then. If I sing it again, perhaps I will remember that feeling as well.

**Helena**<br>
Of course you can! Alright, time's up. Say hello to everybody~

**PAFF**<br>
Okay.
