...... Ugh......

**Noah**<br>
Helena! Are you awake!?

**Helena**<br>
Ugh......

**Noah**<br>
Doctor! Doctor!

**Bryan**<br>
Oh? Is she awake? Thank goodness!

**Helena**<br>
Where am I...?

**Bryan**<br>
This is 03 hospital. You've been unconscious for an entire day. How are you feeling?

**Helena**<br>
......!<br>
Aroma? Where is Aroma!?

**Noah**<br>
......

**Bryan**<br>
Rest assured, her conditions are stable. However, she has yet to regain consciousness...

**Helena**<br>
Where is she!? Take me to her, now!

**Noah**<br>
Hey, where are you going? You are not in the shape to run around...

**Bryan**<br>
It's fine. Both of you didn't suffer severe injuries. Your sister is in the ICU. I'll take you there.

**Helena**<br>
...... No... this can't be... *\*Bawls\**!!!!

**Noah**<br>
......

**Bryan**<br>
... Even though her injuries are severe, she is still young. With modern medicine and health technology, she will recover in no time.

**Noah**<br>
I see...

**Bryan**<br>
What I'm more concerned right now is the injuries to her head. This is a CT scan of her brain. These white dots are small pieces of debris. They happen to be lodged right between crucial nerves. It's practically a miracle that she's still alive now. However, this could also be the reason why she hasn't regain consciousness... We've tried our best to remove as much of the debris as we can, but a surgery on these spots will risk injury to her brain.

**Noah**<br>
... What about SWT?

**Bryan**<br>
Judging by that, you seem to be a professional in the field. That makes things easier to explain.<br>
We've already tried SWT; we even used MKII. However, the composition of the debris is way too complicated. If they break and seep into her blood vessels, there's the risk of blood poisoning...

**Noah**<br>
What about the Nano arm?

**Bryan**<br>
... Not even the Nano arm can reach the remaining pieces. There's also the possibility of damaging the nerves. We really can't do anything about...

**Noah**<br>
Is there really nothing left you can do!? You bunch of worthless fake doctors!!

*\[Equipment crashing\]*

**Helena**<br>
......Noah!?

**Bryan**<br>
Mr. Noah... P, please calm down! We really want to save the patient as well!

**Helena**<br>
Noah! Stop it!

**Noah**<br>
... I'm sorry... I...

**Bryan**<br>
......

**Helena**<br>
It... it's all my fault... If I didn't insist that I sit in the backseat, Aroma would've sat in her original seat. She wouldn't have...

**Noah**<br>
... If you sit in the front seat, you might've already died from the impact...

**Helena**<br>
It's still better than what's happening now!!

**Bryan**<br>
... I understand that both of you are very frustrated. However, please calm down for now. In the current situation, a reckless surgery will only put the patient in harm's way. At the very least, her vital signs are stable right now...

**Helena**<br>
OK...

**Bryan**<br>
We will think of other methods to save her. Please believe in us!

**Noah**<br>
... I'll leave it to you.
