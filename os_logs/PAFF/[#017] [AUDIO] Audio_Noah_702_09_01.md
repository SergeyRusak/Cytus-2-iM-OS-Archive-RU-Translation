Aroma.

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Helena**<br>
Aroma? I'm coming in?

**Aroma**<br>
......

**Helena**<br>
You... Are you feeling well? Why do you leave the lights off again? You've been locking yourself in your room a lot lately. I'm really worried.<br>
Are you still not feeling well?

**Aroma**<br>
... Is there something you want?

**Helena**<br>
Eh? Not really... I'm just concerned about you...

**Aroma**<br>
I'm fine.

**Helena**<br>
Good to hear that...<br>
Oh, right... Mono has sent us the notice for the next event. There's a performance on the 15th... Of course, Aroma's physical condition is still the top priority.

**Aroma**<br>
... As expected...

**Helena**<br>
I'm sorry about this. I previously told them that you still need a while to recover. However, the higher\-ups feel like you've taken too much time off... Mono has been very busy dealing with the aftermaths of the concert. The constant interviews, phone calls, and rescheduling are starting to take a toll on the company. A lot of the future events have been affected by that incident.<br>
From my point of view, I can't really ask the company to do more...

**Aroma**<br>
......

**Helena**<br>
Ah, I don't mean to blame Aroma. After all, you collapsed on stage because of the amount of work you had to put up with. Your body simply can't take it anymore.<br>
However, the higher\-ups are persistent this time...

**Aroma**<br>
......

**Helena**<br>
Aroma?

**Aroma**<br>
... No.

**Helena**<br>
... Umm, this is a pretty simple performance. It should take no more than 30 minutes. We can use old sets... at least show up to let the fans know you're alright...

**Aroma**<br>
I don't want to go.

**Helena**<br>
... Please. Your medical numbers have been really stable too. I just can't dodge their request anymore. Please, just this once. I'll find a way to handle future events afterward...

**Aroma**<br>
I SAID NO!!

**Helena**<br>
...... A, Aroma?

**Aroma**<br>
I'm sorry... I... I don't want to go.

**Helena**<br>
Is it... Is it because of your body?

**Aroma**<br>
I... don't know...

**Helena**<br>
Or is it because you're tired of being an idol? It's fine... Can you talk to me about it...?

**Aroma**<br>
Stop asking! I don't know!

**Helena**<br>
......

**Aroma**<br>
*Sobs*...

**Helena**<br>
......<br>
I understand... I'll go turn down their request and tell them to replace you with someone else.

**Aroma**<br>
......

**Helena**<br>
It's okay, Aroma... You don't have to perform at the event. I'll have Chris replace you with Cherry. They can handle the stage this time.

**Helena**<br>
You... you should get some rest. I will not disturb you anymore, okay?

**Aroma**<br>

**Helena**<br>

What... just what am I...
