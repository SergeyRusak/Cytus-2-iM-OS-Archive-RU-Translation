*... PAFF, the music diva who was harassed by a male fan a while ago, had another incident. At the end of a three\-hour physical concert at Node 08, she fainted on stage while singing the encore song "Gravity". The singer's sudden collapse had the audience in utter shock. Her agency immediately called off the concert and arranged her for an emergency medical checkup...*

**Helena**<br>
Noah! What is going on with Aroma!?

**Noah**<br>
Calm down. We are still running the analysis as well...

**Helena**<br>
She's... this is just way too abnormal.

**Noah**<br>
......

**Helena**<br>
What we did... was it really the right thing to do?

**Noah**<br>
Why are you saying this all of a sudden...?

**Helena**<br>
Sometimes when I look at her face... It certainly is my little sister's face, and she certainly does have my little sister's memory... But it's as if I'm looking at a complete stranger...

**Noah**<br>
You're thinking too much. Aroma is Aroma. We worked so hard to finally bring her back. Right now, all we need to do is cherish the fact that she's still here.

**Helena**<br>
......

**Noah**<br>
No need to worry, I will re\-adjust the parameters for the stabilizers to better stabilize her brain and mental condition. Right now, let us complete the analysis so we can figure out what the problem is.

**Helena**<br>
Yes...

**Noah**<br>
You look really pale and haggard. You've not slept well for the past few days, haven't you? Get some rest in the break room. I'll handle the rest.

**Helena**<br>
It's okay... I still have to make a PR post on iM. I'll leave the things here to you.

**Researcher A**<br>
Are you awake? Director!

**[Noah]**<br>
*Aroma.*

**PAFF**<br>
Noah... Ugh... What happened to me?

**[Noah]**<br>
*You fainted on stage... Rest assured, the checkup results showed nothing more than mere exhaustion. You'll be fine after some rest and nutrients. Your schedule for the past few days may have taken a serious toll on your body.*

**PAFF**<br>
Where's sister...?

**[Noah]**<br>
*Resting in the room next door. Because of you, she barely had any rest for the past few days too.*

**PAFF**<br>
*\*Sobs\**... *\*Sobs\**...

**[Noah]**<br>
*What's wrong...?*

**PAFF**<br>
I'm so happy... that I still remember you guys. I was so afraid that I'll forget everything again when I wake up... *\*Sobs\**...

**[Noah]**<br>
*... Rest assured. The scan results showed everything to be normal. Starting today, you siblings should both take some time off. You guys are working too much.<br>
As with the company's events, I'll find a way to let Chris handle them.*

**PAFF**<br>
I'm sorry... I made you guys worried again. I even caused everyone so much trouble...

**[Noah]**<br>
*No need to apologize. Nobody will blame you for what happened... In fact, I should be the one apologizing to you. As your attending physician, I failed to take good care of your physical conditions...<br>
Don't overthink yourself. You need to rest. I'll apply some medication to make you feel more relaxed. Enjoy your sleep.*

**PAFF**<br>
OK...
