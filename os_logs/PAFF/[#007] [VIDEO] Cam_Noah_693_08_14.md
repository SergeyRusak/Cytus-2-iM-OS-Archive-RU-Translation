**Helena**<br>
Aroma? I'm coming in?<br>
... Yikes, so dark... Why don't you turn on the lights?

**PAFF**<br>
......

**Helena**<br>
Aroma?

**[Tuner-san]**<br>
*Aroma is feeling down. Aroma is feeling down...*

**Helena**<br>
......

**Helena**<br>
Are you lying in bed? I'm squeezing in...<br>
Haha, it's a bit crowded here.

**PAFF**<br>
Sister...

**Helena**<br>
Shhhh... let me guess.<br>
Tomorrow, you are making your debut for real. That fact is making you very nervous. Am I right?

**PAFF**<br>
......

**Helena**<br>
What's the matter? I'm right here.

**PAFF**<br>
...... Yes......

**Helena**<br>
Silly child, didn't you practice really hard? Chris told you too; as long as you live up to your usual standards, it will be the most amazing performance ever... I'm not worried one bit.

**PAFF**<br>
But... when I think of how much sister has done for me... If I fail...

**Helena**<br>
......

**Helena**<br>
Aroma, come here.

**PAFF**<br>
No\~... We're all grown\-ups now. This is weird...

**Helena**<br>
I've grown up too. No matter what, I will always be 8 years older than you. Come here. Don't think about anything and close your eyes.

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

**PAFF**<br>
Hugging each other like this... it feels nostalgic.

**Helena**<br>
Do you remember that when you're little, the two of us have to share one tiny bed?

**PAFF**<br>
We were a poor family... Back then, sister had to work part\-time at multiple jobs. It must be tough.

**Helena**<br>
It really was tiring. Every time you told me that I can have the bed to myself, only for you to climb back onto the bed in the middle of the night all the time. Oh, and you steal the blanket too.

**PAFF**<br>
I can't help it. It's really cold at night... By the way, so you do know about it. Back then, you lied to me saying that you didn't know what happened...

**Helena**<br>
Hmph. I am a light sleeper. Of course I would know.

**PAFF**<br>
I am sorry...

**Helena**<br>
I know many other things. Every time I had a nightmare, you would stay by my side, rub my head, and sing songs to me.

**PAFF**<br>
......

**Helena**<br>
That singing, it's the kindest, most calming voice I ever heard in my life. <br>
Whenever I'm feeling depressed, I think about your singing. It makes me feel like I can keep going on. That's how I was able to manage, till this very day. 

**PAFF**<br>
Sister...

**Helena**<br>
Your voice is filled with inspiring power. Isn't it your wish to use this power to make more people realize their hopes and dreams?

**PAFF**<br>
Of course I would! But, if possible... I would like to sing just for sister too...

**Helena**<br>
......<br>
A long time ago, I asked you this question. Now, I am going to ask you the same question again: What is Aroma's favorite thing in the world?

**PAFF**<br>
Sister.

**Helena**<br>
Wrong! Not this one, try again.

**PAFF**<br>
Hmm... singing?<br>
Yes, it's singing. When I'm singing, I feel... happy.

**Helena**<br>
See? Compare to me, there are definitely more people out there in the world who needs to be inspired, be touched, and be encouraged by you singing. <br>
Therefore, worry no more. For yourself and for everyone, sing; sing to your heart's content.

**Helena**<br>
As for myself, as long as Aroma can stay happy forever, I will be plenty satisfied.

**PAFF**<br>
... Thank you, sister. Thank you so much... *\*Sobs\**...

**Helena**<br>
Silly child, why are you crying? You call yourself a grown\-up, yet you're the same old crybaby...<br>
It's alright. Enjoy singing and enjoy the stage. Bring power to everyone in the world! You can definitely do it.

**[Tuner-san]**<br>
*Fight on! Fight on!*

**PAFF**<br>
Yes... I will try my best.

**Helena**<br>
Good... Aw, look at you, your face is a mess. Go wash your face. Noah is waiting for us in the living room. Let's have dinner together.

**PAFF**<br>
Got it... I'll be there soon.

*\[Door Opens\]*

**PAFF**<br>
Sister... *\*Sobs\*...*
