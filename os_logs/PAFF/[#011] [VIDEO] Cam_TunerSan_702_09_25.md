...... Sister......

**Pedestrian A**<br>
Ugh, this news again. I'm getting really tired of it. Also what kind of stupid question is that? That reporter needs to get fired.

**Pedestrian B**<br>
Whatever, it's just another publicity stunt, isn't it? Once they get all the attention, she'll suddenly pop out of nowhere and make all the money.

**Pedestrian A**<br>
Haha, that's how showbiz works anyway. So damn predictable.
