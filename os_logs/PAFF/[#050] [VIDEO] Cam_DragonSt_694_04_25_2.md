**Kaori**<br>
Woah! It's you guys...

**Brother Zhao**<br>
Hahaha, told you we were coming to see your performance. Well, here we are!

**Big Sis**<br>
We were afraid that we would miss the first few songs, so we had the head chef pack the leftovers. He was FURIOUS, yelling things like "How dare you do this to my cooking! My cooking needs to be enjoyed right here!"...

**Brother Zhao**<br>
He got so mad that his chef hat fell off and we got to see his shiny bald head! Hahaha!

*\[Audience laughter\]*

**Kaori**<br>
Haha, you guys are so...

**Kaori**<br>
If that's the case, we can't disappoint everyone no matter what! Are you prepared?

**Hayato**<br>
No problem... Let's begin.<br>
... Our first step towards our "music world".

**Kaori**<br>
... Yes.

**Kaori**<br>
Well then, here's our first song!

**Kaori**<br>
Thank you everyone... Woah! Brother Zhao, are you crying!? You're overreacting!

**Brother Zhao**<br>
It's because your singing was too good!

**Kaori**<br>
Hehe! Thanks\~

**Kaori**<br>
Audience, please give a round of applause to my partner Hayato as well! He wrote more than half of our songs!

*\[Audience applauds\]*

**Hayato**<br>
EH? Ummm... Ha, hahaha...

**Kaori**<br>
Hoho\~ Look at him, he's embarassed\~ His entire face is bright red.

**Kaori**<br>
Well then, we've sung our songs and received our applause...<br>
That's it for our performance today. Thanks, everybody!

*\[Audience laughter\]*

**Brother Zhao**<br>
What the hell!? You only performed two songs!

**Hayato**<br>
Pfft...

**Kaori**<br>
Haha, I was messing around with you\~ See, you're not as nervous as before, right?

**Hayato**<br>
I guess... so.

**Kaori**<br>
Guess? So you still have your doubts\~<br>
Then I'll ask the crowd. Do you guys want to hear us sing?

**Audience**<br>
YES!

**Kaori**<br>
Do you want to hear us sing some more?

**Audience**<br>
WE DO!

**Hayato**<br>
Hahaha...

**Kaori**<br>
Can't help it then.<br>
If that's the case, tonight... we sing till we drop dead! How does that sound, everyone!?
