**Phoenix**<br>
Just one person?

**Hayato**<br>
Yes. I'm the only one!

**Phoenix**<br>
... The heck? Isn't this just a brat? Don't call me to the storage room for a brat like this.

**Member D**<br>
Director! Even though it's just thugs stealing some unimportant cargo, this has been happening every month. They've been taking our cargo one bit at a time. It must be the Hou Sang Tang people who are doing all this!

**Phoenix**<br>
And why does that matter? I always knew that they've been doing shady tricks like this. Even if they get their dirty paws on our parts, they don't have the technology to present any threat to us.

**Member D**<br>
... Then... what should we do with this guy?

**Phoenix**<br>
What do you mean "what should we do"? You guys can do whatever you want with him, be it let him go or "deal" with him. Hey, what's your name?

**Hayato**<br>
H\-Hayato... Hayato Kusu.

**Phoenix**<br>
......<br>
I think I've seen this name somewhere... Brat, come with me for a bit.

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

**Phoenix**<br>
As I expected. Your guardian, her name is Feng Huang, right?

**Hayato**<br>
......! Yes... Umm, how did you...

**Phoenix**<br>
Here, she's on the candidate list for our latest medical project.

**Hayato**<br>
Medical project...? I thought you guys are part of the underground society. Kyuu Hou Kai and the eight Ravens... I've heard some things about them.

**Phoenix**<br>
We are indeed part of the underground society. However, Node 03 as a whole is part of the underground society. Who do you think provides the admins with the technology you people use every day? Managing the city is a part of our job as well.

**Hayato**<br>
......

**Phoenix**<br>
Your grandma, she suffered a brain stroke, correct? She is in a coma right now. Her situation just so happens to match the conditions of a test subject for our latest technology. Perhaps, there's a way to wake her up.

**Hayato**<br>
... Seriously!?

**Phoenix**<br>
But, this is an unstable project that is still in its experimental phase. Both the price and risks are way too high. No one is willing to try, so there's no way for us to continue.<br>
... What do you think? If you're willing to sign an affidavit that allows her to be our test subject, I will overlook the theft you committed against us.

**Hayato**<br>
......!

*[→Audio\_???\_698\_03\_18]*

**Medical Staff**<br>
I'm sorry. Your grandma's brain nerves were too badly damaged. The experiment has failed. However, it's not a complete failure either. We've successfully restored all her senses except vision. You can interact with her through this interface. Her thoughts will be presented to you through words and synthetic voices.

**Hayato**<br>
......!? Please activate it right away!

**Medical Staff**<br>
I must remind you... the experiment failed. If you activate it now, she will only live for another two minutes... However, even if you just leave her like this, you don't know when she'll pass away too. The decision is yours to make.

**Hayato**<br>
......!<br>
... *\*Sobs\**...

*[»»» Fast Forward 30 minutes»»»]*

**Hayato**<br>
I... I've made my decision...<br>
Please activate it. However... before that, I would like the nurse to help me with something...

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

**[Feng]**<br>
This is...? Where am I? It's so dark...

**Hayato**<br>
Grandma! It's me, Hayato! Can you feel it? My hand.

**[Feng]**<br>
*Hayato...*

**Hayato**<br>
......

*\[Opens bottle\]*

**[Feng]**<br>
This... scent... Kaori?... Is it Kaori!? Where are you!?

**Hayato**<br>
......

**[Kaori]**<br>
*Grandma!*

**Nurse**<br>
...... (Holds hand)

**[Feng]**<br>
*Kaori! Hayato has found you? You're back? I... I can feel it... your hand...*

**Nurse**<br>
......

**Hayato**<br>
... Grandma, Kaori has come back.

**[Feng]**<br>
*I knew it... You're a brave girl. You're still alive... I knew Hayato would definitely find you... Ah... thank you... thank the lord...*

**Hayato**<br>
Yes. You don't need to worry anymore. You no longer have to cry yourself to sleep every night...

**[Feng]**<br>
*Good... Thank... goodness...*

**Hayato**<br>
......

**Medical Staff**<br>
The time... is up.

**Hayato**<br>
You can... finally, sleep with a smile. You can sleep with a smile, forever...  WAAAHHHHHH!!!! 

*[→Cam\_Grave\_702\_11\_23]*

**Hayato**<br>
We're here, her grave.<br>
After all that, I spent all my money just to meet with The Eye of Horus...

**PAFF**<br>
*\*Sniffs\*... \*Sniffs\*...*

**Hayato**<br>
... Kaori?

**PAFF**<br>
*\*Sobs\**... I... I remember now. Why... Why did I forget... such an important person... Grandma Feng! WAAHHHHH!! *\*Bawls\**.

**Hayato**<br>
.....<br>
So you remember? Thank goodness... You... you're indeed Kaori. Grandma always believed that you were still alive, even until the very end... Grandma, I wasn't lying. See, Kaori is here... I found her.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
*\*Sniffs\**... NEKO will... leave you two alone for a while. Take your time.
