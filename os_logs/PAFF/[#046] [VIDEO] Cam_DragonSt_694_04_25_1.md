*\[Guitar\]*

**Hayato**<br>
Hmm... Still not quite right...

*\[Guitar\]*

**Hayato**<br>
Much better... No, that's a bit too much... Argh, what do I do?

**Kaori**<br>
Hey, why are you sulking like that? Cheer up!

**Hayato**<br>
Yikes! You scared me...<br>
Umm... Thanks for the hard work. I've set up all the equipment.

**Kaori**<br>
Haha, what hard work? Thanks anyway\~ I'll set up the keyboard right away. Gimme a minute.

**Hayato**<br>
Sure... How was the restaurant today?

**Kaori**<br>
Same as always. Refilling water, washing dishes, greeting customers, occasionally getting yelled at by the head chef. My god\~ my ears are still ringing.

**Hayato**<br>
Ahaha... He really is very loud.

**Kaori**<br>
You don't get to make jokes! How dare you take today off! It was busy as hell! You got off easy...

**Hayato**<br>
Sorry. I had other work to do in the afternoon...

**Kaori**<br>
Nah, it's fine. You did well... Oh, right! Brother Zhao and Big Sis will both come to watch us perform! They went to the restaurant today as well.

**Hayato**<br>
Yikes... The pressure is even higher...

**Kaori**<br>
Grandma Feng was originally going to come too, but her coughing was not getting any better. It took me quite the effort to persuade her to stay at home alone.

**Hayato**<br>
I see... I hope grandma can recover from her illness soon.

**Kaori**<br>
......

**Kaori**<br>
Aww, come on\~ Why the long face! Even your guitar looks sad! You can't play good music with a sad\-looking guitar!

**Hayato**<br>
I, I... I am just a bit anxious.<br>
After all, this is our first time performing in such a bustling city district... If the audience response is lukewarm, I'll feel a bit... hurt.

**Kaori**<br>
You little... We've performed so many times already... Come, place your head here.

**Hayato**<br>
Are we doing "that" again? I don't want to...

**Kaori**<br>
Shut it! This is a magic trick that was taught to me by grandma. If you rub the temple like this, the feeling of anxiousness will disappear. I've only taught this to one other person, you, so far!

**Hayato**<br>
Owow... That hurt that hurt that hurt! You're putting too much force into it! My skull is going to crack!

**Kaori**<br>
Hahaha, blame yourself! If you get nervous so easily, how are we going to take our next step to a bigger stage? <br>
Didn't we make a promise? That we were going to take our songs "there"?

**Hayato**<br>
Yes, the "music world" of our dreams... <br>
I'll definitely get you there. You're different than me. You shouldn't be stuck in a dirty, crappy place like this.

**Kaori**<br>
...... What... You have to be there with me, together.

**Hayato**<br>
Huh?

**Kaori**<br>
Nothing... Oh, a crowd is starting to gather. Are you ready?<br>
Ah\~Ah\~, Mic test, mic test\~

*\[Audience applauds\]*

**Hayato**<br>
Ah, just give me another second... sorry.

*[Signal Lost]*
