**Kaori**<br>
Grandma Feng, we're here!

**Feng**<br>
Ah, "Furuhata Charity Foundation", they've gotten a new sign too...<br>
How many years have it been, Kaori\-chan?

**Kaori**<br>
Four, five, six... six years! I wonder if everyone still recognizes me?

**Feng**<br>
Time sure flies. Kaori\-chan was just three years old back then... One blink of the eye and you're all grown\-up now. <br>
What do you think of the past few years you spent with this old grandma? Are you happy?

**Kaori**<br>
I'm very happy! Thank you so much for adopting me, grandma Feng! You even let me help with the flower shop! I love seeing the customers' smiling faces!

**Feng**<br>
Haha... good girl. Here, let's go inside.

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Kaori**<br>
Wow, it smells so nice\~

**Saku**<br>
Because it happens to be lunch time, Kaori\-chan!

**Kaori**<br>
Aunt Saku! Headmaster Tsumugi too! Long time no see!

**Feng**<br>
Long time no see. We'll be in your care today too, Mrs. Tsumugi.

**Tsumugi**<br>
Not at all, we're the ones in your care, Mrs. Huang! You've taken great care of Kaori\-chan for the past few years. When we heard that you plan to adopt another child, we were all very delighted.

**Feng**<br>
I'm flattered. These days, I often hear customers talk about this foundation. They all said that you guys helped everyone a lot... Unlike me, who is already too old to do anything.

**Saku**<br>
Don't say that, Mrs. Huang. You often gift us flowers for free. We are all very thankful of you.

**Tsumugi**<br>
Saku has a point. There aren't many good people like you out there. You deserve all the praise you get.<br>
Setting that aside, why did you want to adopt a child again all of a sudden?

**Feng**<br>
My back's been hurting real bad lately. The labor at the flower shop is getting more and more difficult for me. An extra person would definitely make things easier... Besides, I want to find Kaori\-chan a friend too.<br>
Ah, right. Is your husband not here?

**Tsumugi**<br>
Same as always. Not taking one step outside his research room...

*[→Signal Switches]*

**Little Boy A**<br>
Big brother, give me one!

**Little Boy B**<br>
Me too! Me too!

**???**<br>
Ah... wait a sec...

**Little Boy C**<br>
Why did you give it to her first! Do you like her more than me!?

**???**<br>
P, please wait... I'll be right there...

**Kaori**<br>
STOP\~!!<br>
Everyone, no rushing!

**???**<br>
!?

*\[Utensils clinging\]*

**Kaori**<br>
Alright, alright. Everybody, line up here. If you haven't wash your hands, go wash them first! Only the good kids who follow the rules will get lunch!

**Little Boy A**<br>
... Big sister, who are you?

**Kaori**<br>
Good question. I'm a sorcerer who happens to pass by. Any dish touched by me will become super delicious. Here, this one is for you!

**Little Boy A**<br>
Wow! Thank you, big sister!

**Kaori**<br>
Hey, quick, fill up the next bowl. There's still a lot of people waiting behind them.

**???**<br>
Ah, okay...

*\[Utensils clinging\]*

**???**<br>
This one is for you.

**Little Boy B**<br>
It smells so good\~ Thank you, big brother!

**???**<br>
... Haha.

**Kaori**<br>
Hey, you look good with a smile\~ When did you come here?

**???**<br>
R, recently...

**Kaori**<br>
No wonder I've never seen you before. I used to lived here as well, but grandma Feng adopted me and took me away a long time ago.

**???**<br>
Grandma... Feng?

**Kaori**<br>
She is the most awesome and kindest grandma in the entire world. Look, she's right there talking to the headmaster.

**???**<br>
Oh...

**Kaori**<br>
Ah, right. My name is Kaori. What's your name?

**???**<br>
I... I'm...

*[→Signal Switches]*

**Feng**<br>
... Will this child... be willing to come with me?

**Tsumugi**<br>
Rest assured, Mrs. Huang... Hayato is a good kid. He'll be more than happy to go with you.
