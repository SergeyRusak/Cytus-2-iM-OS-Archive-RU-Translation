... In today's summit, Dr. Colin Neumann Jr. published his new thesis regarding ancient instruments and the culture surrounding them. His papers created a huge buzz in the academic world. This is Dr. Neumann's third open publication of the year...

**Noah**<br>
Brilliant. This guy is seriously amazing...

**Helena**<br>
What are you talking about?

**Noah**<br>
Colin Neumann, did you not know about him?

**Helena**<br>
Neumann... I've heard that name somewhere... Oh right, he is one of A.R.C.'s archeology experts. I've read his documents before.

**Noah**<br>
Correct. The person in the news right now is his son who bears the same name. He is even better than his father.<br>
To be more specific, this thesis of his is about...

**Helena**<br>
Ho... is that so?<br>
Ah, Aroma, you're done with the bath? Then I guess it's my turn.

**Noah**<br>
Not listening at all...

**PAFF**<br>
Ah, you guys are back? The bathroom is available now.<br>
Noah, you left work early today again?

**Noah**<br>
Yes, another step closer to being fired. If that happens, this household will have to rely on future superstar Aroma... oh, I mean, PAFF.

**PAFF**<br>
Stop that, you're saying weird things again...<br>
Still can't get used to this new name...

**Helena**<br>
Stop spouting nonsense, you weirdo.<br>
I'm going to go take a shower. If I listen to you talk anymore I feel like my ears are going to fall off...

**Noah**<br>
......

**PAFF**<br>
Sister, the floor is still a bit wet. Be careful.

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

**[Television]**<br>
*... In the series of papers published by Dr. Neumann, his interpretation of ancient technology has been significantly different from A.R.C.'s previous theories, leading to heated discussions within the community. Rumor has it that some of Dr.Neumann's evidence came from non\-legal sources, making the papers and the doctor himself the topic of many controversies. However, voices that support his theories are gaining more and more ground in the industry...*

**Noah**<br>
Haha, "significantly different"? How ignorant... they just don't have the balls to admit that "We are a bunch of idiots who are absurdly wrong about everything".

**PAFF**<br>
Are you saying... that this person is actually correct?

**Noah**<br>
Indeed. I've read several of his papers; absolute destruction of A.R.C.'s "theories". It was as if what the A.R.C. firmly believed to be "ancient civilization" for years was nothing but a terrible joke. Did you see the expressions of those geezers in the audience? God, they were hilarious.

**PAFF**<br>
Wow...

**Noah**<br>
However, to A.R.C., his publications provided them with significant benefits, far outweighing the embarrassment they suffered.

**PAFF**<br>
How so?

**Noah**<br>
How should I begin with this...<br>
The "Old Humans" have much more superior technology than what we currently have. I believe you know about this; don't you, Aroma?

**PAFF**<br>
Yes. The Academy taught us about it.

**[Tuner-san]**<br>
*Aroma is a top student at the Academy! Her grades this year rank 3rd among all students!*

**Noah**<br>
Hoho? That's impressive.<br>
Then here's a pop quiz for you: <br>
When did "The Decommission" of Architects occur?

**PAFF**<br>
Hmm... I believe it's May 25th, 497 N.A.

**Noah**<br>
Correct! Due to the disappearance of the Architects, most of the Nodes' infrastructure went into paralysis. It almost resulted in a major "Blackout" crisis. In order to analyze and recreate ancient technology so a similar incident won't happen again, we founded A.R.C. Unfortunately, in recent years, not much notable progress had been made. Things finally took a turn for good when Dr. Neumann stepped onto the scene and debunked a lot of the false claims we made. Thanks to him, we are finally able to determine a clear direction for our exploration and research. His contributions saved us at least ten years of messing around and doing nothing.

**PAFF**<br>
Wow... but the lecturers at the Academy don't seem to like him very much. They told us that he has many criminal records and is not someone we should aspire to be like...

**Noah**<br>
*\*Sighs\**... The lecturers at the Academy are probably hired by those stubborn geezers at A.R.C. too. Even your current curriculum has been altered a lot by the Administration Bureau. Did you know that before "The Decommission", the Academy itself was fully automatic, and lecturers were simply not required?

**PAFF**<br>
Eh? Really? They didn't teach us that...<br>
Noah, you're so knowledgeable.

**Noah**<br>
I am the director of A.R.C.'s research department after all. <br>
If I have to make a guess, your curriculum is going to be rewritten again in a few years. Node 08's technology will experience a brand\-new breakthrough... When that time arrives, it will be living proof that this guy is an extraordinary talent.

**PAFF**<br>
I think Noah is quite extraordinary too.

**Noah**<br>
Haha... I'm not at that level.

**PAFF**<br>
But... recently, Noah has been coming home early quite a lot. Your work... has the previous incident you mentioned been resolved yet?<br>
I'm a bit worried... Should you talk to sister about this?

**Noah**<br>
......

**PAFF**<br>
Noah?

**Noah**<br>
... Nothing.<br>
No need to worry, My research is still going on. I truly believe that it can also be an important milestone in technology development. If only those old farts can actually think with their brains...

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Helena**<br>
Hey! Didn't I tell you not to talk about work in front of Aroma!

**Noah**<br>
Ah... I got caught up in the mood... I'm sorry.

**Helena**<br>
Seriously... Stopping instilling people with your random crap. That's why you never get favored by your superiors...

**PAFF**<br>
... Sister!

**Noah**<br>
No... it's ok. She is speaking the truth after all. Haha...
