Next up, performer no.12... Aroma White.<br>
Please take your position and introduce yourself.

**PAFF**<br>
......

**Host**<br>
Umm... hello?

**PAFF**<br>
Eh? Ah, I'm sorry. My name is...

*\[Microphone drops\]*

**Host**<br>
......

**PAFF**<br>
I, I'm so sorry... I... I'm Aroma.

**Judge A**<br>
She's screwed. Can she even sing if she's so nervous already...?

**Judge B**<br>
Yeah... No need to be nervous. How old are you?

**PAFF**<br>
F... fifteen...

**Host**<br>
Relax\~ What song are you singing for us today?

**PAFF**<br>
《Fight Another Day》

**Judge C**<br>
Good. You can start singing when the green light turns red.

**Judge A**<br>
This one's no good. She's so nervous that she can barely talk properly.

**Judge C**<br>
She looks really cute too. What a shame...

**PAFF**<br>
\*As the walls around me tie me to a fragment of emotion<br>
The consequences of my being starts to rise<br>
The ﬁbres of my essence start to ﬂoat away<br>
How can I ever stand to ﬁght another day\*

**Judge A**<br>
......!

**Judge B**<br>
Holy...!<br>
Are you serious...

**Audience**<br>

**PAFF**<br>
...... I... I'm done with my singing. Thank you...

*\[Audience applauds\]*

**Helena**<br>
Aroma! Over here!

**PAFF**<br>
Sister.

**Helena**<br>
Congratulations on winning second place! Your singing was amazing!

**PAFF**<br>
But... only the first place can receive a contract.

**Helena**<br>
Umm...

**PAFF**<br>
She can sing, dance, is very funny, and she looks beautiful too... unlike me...

**Helena**<br>
......

**PAFF**<br>
... It's too hard for me to be like her.

**Helena**<br>
Your singing is great, way better than hers! The audience really loved you, and the applause was loud and clear too. You did great!

**PAFF**<br>
Yes...

**Helena**<br>
You will overcome your nerves someday. We will come back next time. Don't give up, ok? I will help you do this, together.

**PAFF**<br>
Yes... I will work hard...

**Helena**<br>
Good! I will always support your dream. Your voice can definitely make it!<br>
It's getting late. Let's go back.

**PAFF**<br>
OK!
