......

**Helena**<br>
I'm... her sister. I'm her sister...!

**Helena**<br>
... (Breaths deeply)

*\[Door Knock\]*

**Helena**<br>
Aroma, good morning. Wake up!

**Helena**<br>
... Are you still asleep? You need to do a morning check up with Noah. You can sleep after we get back from that, ok? Breakfast is also ready.

**Helena**<br>
......

**Helena**<br>
... Aroma? ... Why is the door locked again!?

**Helena**<br>
... 0420...

*\[Door Opens\]*

*[»»» Fast Forward 10 minutes »»»]*

**Noah**<br>
... The window is open. There are footprints on the grass but they are unable to be tracked. The bent grass has dewdrops on them, which means that she has been gone for a while now. On top of that, no other traces are found.<br>
Aroma... left here by herself.

**Helena**<br>
Noah! Look...!

**Noah**<br>
... The stabilizers... did she take them off...?

**Helena**<br>
Ah... AHHHHHHH! What should we do!? What should we do now!?

**Noah**<br>
Calm down first! There must be some clues. We need to find her as soon as possible...

**Helena**<br>
R, right! Tuner\-san! Tuner\-san will definitely have a record!

**Noah**<br>
She took Tuner\-san with her, and she didn't answer my calls. She even went as far as turning off the location services. This means...

**Helena**<br>
She doesn't want us to find her... Noah... could it be... that she's...

*\[Things crashing\]*

**Noah**<br>
Helena! Get a hold of yourself!

**Helena**<br>
It's my... it's all my fault. Last night, I shouldn't have said that... She must've heard us arguing... It's all because, I said those things...

**Noah**<br>
Helena... blaming yourself won't change anything. This was a decision we made back then. Therefore, we will face it together.

**Helena**<br>
...... You're right. I'm sorry, Noah. *\*Sobs\**...

**Noah**<br>
Alright, stop crying... There are still plenty of things we must do.<br>
Excluding the option of informing the admins first, regarding the situation at Mono, how do you plan to handle it?

**Helena**<br>
We can't just hide this incident, but Mono wouldn't want to make this out to be a big deal either. The best scenario is we find Aroma ourselves. I'll report this to some of the higher\-ups so they can deploy some of Mono's manpower to help the search... I'll also try my best to keep this information between just a few people.

**Noah**<br>
Understood. You go do that.

**Helena**<br>
What about you?

**Noah**<br>
I'll look around here and see if there are any clues I missed.

**Helena**<br>
Okay. I'll trust you with that, Noah...

**Noah**<br>
No problem. I'll handle this. Now go.

*\[Door Closes\]*

**Noah**<br>
......

**Noah**<br>
Ahhhh... AHHHHH......

*\[Punches table\]*

**Noah**<br>
I... can't repent my crimes like this, can't it...? All I did was bring even more suffering... I'm sorry...

*[Signal Lost]*
