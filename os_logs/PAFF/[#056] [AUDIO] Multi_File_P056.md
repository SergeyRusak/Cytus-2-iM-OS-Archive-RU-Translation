**PAFF**<br>
... Hayato, what's the matter? You've been awfully quiet for a while now. Where are we going first?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Are we going back to your home first? If so, we'll visit every single place Aroma\-chan has been to one by one! That way, you'll definitely remember everything!

**Hayato**<br>
Home... it's no longer there anymore. I'm so sorry...

**PAFF**<br>
... Oh, yeah? That's alright. I'm sure there are still many places we can go.

**Hayato**<br>
......<br>
PA... Kaori, I'm not sure how many things you've remembered... but there's only one place I really want to take you to first.

**PAFF**<br>
......?

**Hayato**<br>
Do you remember... anything about Grandma Feng...?

**PAFF**<br>
... The first one I remembered in the basement was you. Everything else... just when I was on the verge of remembering them, they were covered by a bunch of unfamiliar imagery. Sorry, I don't know if you can understand me like this. However, Grandma Feng... I can't help but feel like she's someone very important...

**Hayato**<br>
Forget it. Don't think about it now! Since there's still a while before we get there, I guess I'll tell you about what happened during the time you were gone.

*[→Audio\_Feng's\_694\_05\_06]*

**Agent**<br>
We'll try our best to help you guys search for her. However, I hope you also realize that in Node 03, especially in this downtown area, people missing is a very common thing. You guys aren't civilians with a high offering level, so the Administration Bureau is probably not going to dedicate a lot of resources to this case.

**Feng**<br>
I understand. I'll leave it to you... *\*Sobs\**...

**Agent**<br>
Kaori... is a good girl. My daughter loves to listen to Hayato and her perform at the corner of the street every weekend.

*[→Audio\_Feng's\_694\_05\_10]*

**Hayato**<br>
Grandma! Why!? You don't have to do this!

**Feng**<br>
I'm really sorry, Hayato. Only by selling this flower shop can we request more resources from the admins to help us...

**Hayato**<br>
This shop is everything Grandma has worked for! It's a part of our family's memories... On top of that, your medical bills... I'll figure out a way to make more money! Please think about it again, okay!?

*[→Audio\_Downst\_698\_07\_01]*

**Hayato**<br>
Only made this much today... Just as I thought, without Kaori, nobody wants to listen when it's just me...

**Yamada**<br>
I want to listen!

**Hayato**<br>
......? Wow! Yamada? Is that you!? Long time no see!

**Yamada**<br>
Haha, long time no see, old friend! Why did you stop going to the Academy all of a sudden? I was super lonely!

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

**Hayato**<br>
That's pretty much it. Now, the flower shop is no more. Grandma Feng suffered a brain stroke and has been in the hospital for years... I have to work hard to make more money, all the while I've been trying to search for Kaori. I really am exhausted...

**Yamada**<br>
Kaori, is it...? You hire a dog, let it smell some lavander and tell it to track the scent down, done. It's not that hard, right? She always had this really heavy smell of lavander on her. If you can't find her even with this method, I'd say that it's quite likely that she's already...

**Hayato**<br>
Yamada!

**Yamada**<br>
Yikes! Sorry, my bad. That's right, no need to be so pessimistic. To be honest with you, I dropped out of the Academy as well! I've found a great way to make money, which I feel is something you really need.

**Hayato**<br>
For real!?

*[→Audio\_???\_697\_12\_25]*

**Hayato**<br>
Oyoy!? Are you really going to do this? Isn't this theft!?

**Yamada**<br>
Eh? You need the money, right? You think those pitiful coins you make from your part\-time jobs and lousy music are going to be enough? This is the fastest way to get money!

**Hayato**<br>
... Ugh.

**Yamada**<br>
Ah, sorry. I really like your music. I really do. However, making money is a completely different matter. This is a major business deal, and you better not mess up. <br>
Boys, time to work!

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

**Yamada**<br>
F\*\*\*! Oh crap oh crap oh crap! Run! Get your a\*\*es moving!

**Thug**<br>
Hey! That friend of yours... he's still in the truck! They're taking him away!

**Yamada**<br>
Who gives a f\*\*\* about him!? Run for your damn lives first!

*[→Audio\_???\_697\_12\_25]*

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Member D**<br>
Let's begin unloading the cargo.

**Member I**<br>
Hey... there's a person inside!

**Hayato**<br>
Waah! Don't shoot me!

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

**Member D**<br>
Director, we caught the stealing rat. Our losses over these past few months were probably a result of his handiwork.

**???**<br>
Just one person?
