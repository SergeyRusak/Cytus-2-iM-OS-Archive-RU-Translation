That was close... Almost got recognized again...

**PAFF**<br>
Thank you, Mr. Asakura. Excuse me for all the ruckus...

**???**<br>
......

**PAFF**<br>
Ummm... Mr. Asakura?

**PAFF**<br>
NEKO said the bar is located in Quadrant II...

**PAFF**<br>
You... do know the directions, right?

**???**<br>
......

**PAFF**<br>
......?

**PAFF**<br>
Noah!?

**Noah**<br>
Aroma... I finally found you.

**PAFF**<br>
... I...!

**Noah**<br>
Ah! You don't have to be so anxious! Please hear me out. This is the only opportunity I have to properly talk to you...

**PAFF**<br>
.......

**Noah**<br>
I'm sorry... This is all my fault. I'm the one responsible for everything. It's only natural that you decided to run away.

**Noah**<br>
That night, when your sister and I had the big argument... You heard all of it, didn't you?

**PAFF**<br>
... Just a little bit...

**Noah**<br>
Is that so... Then I'm about to tell you everything now. Everything we... no, everything I did to you.

**PAFF**<br>
Everything...

**Noah**<br>
That's right. Maybe you'll come to despise me after hearing what I'm about to say, and I wouldn't mind it one bit. I had this coming...

**PAFF**<br>
......

**Noah**<br>
... And this is how we managed to bring you back.

**PAFF**<br>
So this body...

**Noah**<br>
Yes. In reality, this is not your body.

**PAFF**<br>
... I... Regarding what I've been able to recall... the memories about my childhood with my sister, those are indeed real. Yet some conflicting images are mixed among these memories...

**Noah**<br>
Yes. This is the exact reason why. In theory, there are two sets of memories existing in your brain right now... I'm sorry. You can despise me all you want; I deserve it.

**PAFF**<br>
I can understand... the emotions you two felt and why you two so desperately wanted to bring me back. So...

**Noah**<br>
No, I'm not done yet. I still have some things... some things I need to tell you. Not even Helena knows about the thing I'm going to tell you next...

**PAFF**<br>
......

**Noah**<br>
In all honesty, this experiment should've succeeded quite easily. We ended up failing so many times... because of me

**Noah**<br>
I tampered with your memory copy because back then, I really, really didn't want you to remember... what happened that night...

**PAFF**<br>
... The night where you got really drunk and did some things to me... right?

**Noah**<br>
... So you remember? That's right. No matter what I tried, I just couldn't properly control the memory parameters. That was what caused everything to go haywire, all because I was too scared at the possibility of not returning to the simple, happy life we previously had.

**Noah**<br>
Even now, when I look at what I became back then, and what I'm doing now saying all this crap, I feel nothing but disgust toward myself.

**PAFF**<br>
Noah, you didn't actually "hurt" me in any way. You collapsed almost immediately after that since you were very drunk...

**Noah**<br>
That's not the point... My feelings toward you back then, those shouldn't have existed in the first place.

**PAFF**<br>
... Yes.

**Noah**<br>
All I desire right now is for you two sisters to be happy... I mean that wholeheartedly. Please believe me.

**PAFF**<br>
Noah... I...

**Noah**<br>
We're home. Let's get inside first.

**PAFF**<br>
