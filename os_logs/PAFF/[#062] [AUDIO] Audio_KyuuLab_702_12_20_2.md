**Member D**<br>
Chief!

**[Nora]**<br>
*Daigo, we're not done yet. Please wait...*

**Member D**<br>
Sorry, Chief. But... please take a look!

**PAFF**<br>
......?

*[»»»Fast Forward»»»]*

**[Nora]**<br>
*... Are we too late?*

**PAFF**<br>
What happened?

**[Nora]**<br>
*Diego and his henchmen in 03, they're... dead, all of them. The news just came in.*

**PAFF**<br>
......!<br>
Was it Xenon...?

**Member D**<br>
That guy!? All by himself?

**[Nora]**<br>
*No, it is very possible. Judging from our current information, the conditions are similar to those of the drone attack on the Kyubo Medical Center. With his abilities, be it blocking the alarm system, hacking into the drones, or destroying Baro's line of defense wouldn't be that difficult of a task.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*In any case, he's in a dangerous situation right now. Diego still has a lot of men in 03. Mogura's men may even use the Administration Bureau's resources to chase him down. Even though I don't think they could get to him before we do... Miss PAFF, please contact Miss Asakura as soon as possible.<br>
... If he becomes a wanted criminal here as well, it's going to be a big problem.*

**PAFF**<br>
O\-Okay!

*[»»»Fast Forward»»»]*

**PAFF**<br>
Yeah... Uh\-huh... Okay, got it. NEKO, please be careful. If something happens you've got to let us know!

**[Nora]**<br>
*Daigo, send some people to follow Miss Asakura. Make sure nothing happens to them.*

**Member D**<br>
Chief, you don't want me to bring them back? That'd be safer...

**[Nora]**<br>
*They left of their own accord. After what happened... I don't want to force them to stay here.*

**Member D**<br>
Understood.<br>
This is Daigo. Security Team A, Team B, if you hear me, respond.

**[Nora]**<br>
*Such a wide\-range use of the ability in such a short time, is your body feeling any abnormalities?*

**PAFF**<br>
Um, not for now. I feel pretty good. I'm just worried about them...

**[Nora]**<br>
*... Miss PAFF, I'm afraid the things we're going to do next will cause even more bystanders——including yourself, to fall into unpredictable situations.*

**PAFF**<br>
……

**[Nora]**<br>
*We're still in the hypothetical stage of determining what the true identity of the enemy is and what their motives are. With this little information, we're unable to guarantee anyone's safety.*

**PAFF**<br>
The enemy's true identity...

**[Nora]**<br>
*I'm afraid it's the one who attacked you in the OS space. It went as far as to destroy the sample of the virus vaccine that we're not even sure was effective. It must be the case where the virus is an important component of this entity's plan. If this brings about a disaster like that which occurred in ancient civilization, we must do everything in our power to stop it.*

**PAFF**<br>
……

**[Nora]**<br>
*You've got to think long and hard about this. If you want out, I won't force you to stay... What I mean is that I don't want anything bad to happen to you because of us. I also don't want you to think that you have some sort of duty to do this because of who you are.*

**PAFF**<br>
No... I don't feel like this is my duty.

**[Nora]**<br>
*Good, if you still trust the safety of these facilities, you can stay here with Hayato until...*

**PAFF**<br>
No, no. What I mean is, I don't feel like doing this is my duty or responsibility, it's what I want to do. It's what I must do.

**Nora**<br>
……

**PAFF**<br>
If this stems from Node 08 ——the place where my sister lives, she may be in danger. There are people I care about as well, and I don't want anything terrible to happen to them because of my decisions.

**[Nora]**<br>
*Are you sure?*

**PAFF**<br>
Nora, I... have two sets of memories. Whether they are Aroma's or Kaori's, both of them are clear and as real as they can be. Some things may not have gone as we would have liked in those memories of "ours", but we experienced a lot of wonderful things as well.

**PAFF**<br>
No matter which city those memories came from, they both make me feel that this world is such a wonderful place, full of hope. The people we love, the people who love us, the power that comes from that... I believe that is an important element in the formation of this world.

**Nora**<br>
……

**PAFF**<br>
I don't want any sort of hatred to take that away from this world. I believe that expresses how we both feel about this.

**[Nora]**<br>
*... Is that so?*

**PAFF**<br>
So please let me continue to help, and I'll do everything I can until the very end!

**[Nora]**<br>
*……<br>
Understood. We'll need some time to prepare everything. We'll need to confirm the identity of the enemy, their goal, and how we can fight against them before taking action. If we need your help during this time, we would appreciate it.*

**PAFF**<br>
Okay!

**[Nora]**<br>
*Miss PAFF...*

**PAFF**<br>
Yes?

**[Nora]**<br>
*... Nothing, it's nothing. You... you really are an amazing person.<br>
... Thank you.*
