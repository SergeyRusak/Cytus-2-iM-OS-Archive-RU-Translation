*\[Door Opens\]*

**Helena**<br>
...... Aroma!

*\[Hugs\]*

**PAFF**<br>
Sister...

**Helena**<br>
I'm sorry...! I'm so sorry!

**PAFF**<br>
... *\*Sniff\**...

**Noah**<br>
......

**Helena**<br>
You seem exhausted...

**PAFF**<br>
A bit... I haven't slept well for the past few days...

**Helena**<br>
There are so many things I want to say to you...

**PAFF**<br>
Noah already told me quite a bit on our way here...

**Noah**<br>
......

**Helena**<br>
... Is that so... Although I also have a lot of things I want to say to you personally, you should get some rest first. You must be dead tired... We can take our time with what we want to say after you wake up.

**PAFF**<br>
Okay. Thank you.

**Noah**<br>
......

**Helena**<br>
... Noah, what is all this about?

**Noah**<br>
I told her everything. Isn't this what you wanted?

**Helena**<br>
... Aroma... what did so say?

**Noah**<br>
She didn't blame us for what we did.

**Helena**<br>
... Even if she did feel that way, my guess is that she'll never actually say it to us. That's how kindhearted of a child she is.

**Noah**<br>
Helena, now that everything is out of the way, we now have the chance to let her forget all the pain. This time, we'll definitely succeed in turning her back into what she used to be.

**Helena**<br>
... Eh...? What do you mean...?

**Noah**<br>
Soon, we can go back to what we were before. I'll absolutely do the right thing this time.

**Helena**<br>
Noah... wait a minute. What are you going to do? This isn't something you can decide on your own, is it?

**Noah**<br>
No... Please hear me out first. This time, we aren't just simply resetting her brain. I just got the latest data from the stabilizers. Her brain is now in utter chaos...

**Helena**<br>
......!

**Noah**<br>
Besides the conflicting sets of memories, there are even some parameters I've never seen before in her head now...

**Helena**<br>
Parameters never seen before... I don't get it. What does that mean?

**Noah**<br>
It's difficult to explain. In short, these extra parameters are now strongly affecting her brainwaves. Perhaps it's due to her lengthy withdrawal from the stabilizers. The previously suppressed signals that shouldn't exist in Aroma's brain are starting to go berserk. This is also one of the sequelae I was most concerned about after the experiment was prematurely stopped. 

**Helena**<br>
How come...

**Noah**<br>
If this keeps going on, her body... we both don't want to lose her again, right?

**Helena**<br>
But forcefully doing that experiment again... I don't know... if this is the right thing to do...

**Noah**<br>
Helena, trust me! This time, I won't make the same mistake again!

**Helena**<br>
That's not the problem. The original owner of that body...

**Noah**<br>
I only care about Aroma. Everything else, I'll treat as the guilt I must shoulder for the rest of my life. I am prepared to face any consequences that may come with my actions.

**Helena**<br>
......

**Noah**<br>
I won't ask for anyone's forgiveness. I won't ask you to shoulder this guilt together with me either. Just treat it as a selfish decision I decided to pursue. Please, think about it carefully.

**Helena**<br>
... I... I don't know. Give me some time. I can't make a decision right away...

**Noah**<br>
Okay...
