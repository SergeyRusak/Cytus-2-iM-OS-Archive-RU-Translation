**PAFF**<br>
I have the singing part nailed down already... but I'm still nervous... after I signed, I will probably meet more strangers and fans...

**PAFF**<br>
... Tuner\-san, project an audience for me.

**[Tuner-san]**<br>
*Audience projected*

**PAFF**<br>
Wow... this is so realistic...<br>
H, hello everyone... My name is...

*[»»» Fast Forward »»»]*

**PAFF**<br>
Hello everyone! I'm Aroma! I, I'm f... fifteen...

**PAFF**<br>
No good... still really nervous; my voice becomes weird... this is just a projection too...

**[Tuner-san]**<br>
*Fight on! Fight on!*

**PAFF**<br>
Yes... can't give up here. Sis Helena is working hard for me as well. I have to keep going... YIKES!?

**Noah**<br>
... It's me.

**PAFF**<br>
Noah... you scared me. I thought there was nobody at home...

**Noah**<br>
I'm sorry. I came back to... get some stuff. Did I scare you?

**PAFF**<br>
Umm... a little. Have you been standing there... for a long time?

**Noah**<br>
... No. I just happen to pass by and was wondering who are you talking to.

**PAFF**<br>
Did you hear me...? That's so embarrassing...<br>
I am practicing how to speak normally in front of a large crowd...

**Noah**<br>
You speak very normally right now though?

**PAFF**<br>
That's because it's you...<br>
If its other people, especially males...

**Noah**<br>
... Speaking of this, it reminds me of our first meeting. That time, I visited your home with Helena. You ran away the instant you saw me, like a scaredy cat. Hahaha.

**PAFF**<br>
Stop it. Don't talk about that... it was so awkward back then.

**Noah**<br>
You can talk to me normally right now, so I can't be your practice partner anymore. What a shame.

**PAFF**<br>
Yeah... it's fine. Thank you.

**Noah**<br>
Your sister is having a meeting at Mono and might return home really late today. How about we have dinner outside today?

**PAFF**<br>
Eh? Didn't you come back to get something? Don't you have to go back to work?

**Noah**<br>
Haha... so you really don't want to have dinner with me?

**PAFF**<br>
Eh? No, that's not what I mean...

**Noah**<br>
I was kidding. I can schedule my breaks freely after I was promoted to director. I found a pretty good restaurant on the 47th floor. Dinner's on me. Come.

**PAFF**<br>
Ok... then let me change my clothes. Thank you for the meal!

**Noah**<br>
You're welcome.

*\[Door closes\]*

**Noah**<br>
... I will be waiting for you.
