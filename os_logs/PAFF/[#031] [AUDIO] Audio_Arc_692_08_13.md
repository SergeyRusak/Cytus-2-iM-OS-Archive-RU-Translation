**Researcher A**<br>
Ah, you're here, director.

**Researcher E**<br>
Good morning, director!

**Noah**<br>
Good morning, Arnold, Eric. How's everything going?

**Researcher A**<br>
Yes, the current phase of the test was conducted on subjects C\-53 to C\-58. Their behavior patterns are 99.7% identical to our pre\-test estimates, easily within the reasonable range. This means that the memory data interpretation this time matches our requirements... Congratulations, director!

**Noah**<br>
Any problems with the behavioral guidance models?

**Researcher E**<br>
Nothing so far. We calculated and built them with the algorithms director designed. They are completely based on the memory data. We can expect error\-free results.

**Noah**<br>
Run the test a few more times, just in case. "The last mile to the truth is an endless abyss"...

**Researcher E**<br>
... "and only those who are diligent can make it through."<br>
Rest assured, director. Everyone here is just like you. We're all people who have inherited the ideas of Mr. Wyle! I'll have Owen test them out again later today!

**Noah**<br>
Excellent. Uriel, the follow\-up report on the test subjects, can you finish it today?

**Researcher U**<br>
Judging by the current progress, won't be a problem!

**Noah**<br>
How trustworthy. I'll leave it to you.<br>
Next... your name is Ian, right?

**Researcher I**<br>
Yes, director! I, I'm intern researcher Ian Stewart! This is my third day at R&D department 01...

**Noah**<br>
Haha, no need to be so nervous... Come to my office later. There are some small things I would like you to do.

**Researcher I**<br>
Y, yes, Sir!

**Noah**<br>
The test species this time "Black Horn Ape", the complexity of its brain tissue is already very similar to humans. Now that the experiment is successful, I believe we've cleared the most difficult challenge... Here's the short\-term closing document for this project. Can you organize it for me? 

**Researcher I**<br>
Yes, director! ... I wonder if the higher\-ups will agree to this or not...

**Noah**<br>
If we're speaking about data alone, our team's results are, without a doubt, the closest thing we ever had to perfection. I don't see a reason why they won't agree.

**Researcher I**<br>
Yes, the data is indeed perfect. There's just the final step. In other words... a human trial...

**Noah**<br>
Ah, so this is what you're concerned about. Ian, our research is based on the coding technology of "that Architect" excavated two years ago. We use that code to analyze the brainwaves of creatures and interpret their memories...

**Researcher I**<br>
Yes, it was a flash of inspiration by director... You're a true genius!

**Noah**<br>
Haha, I still have much to learn.<br>
The point is, to the human who is being interpreted, we're only listening to the voices in his brain. There won't be any side effects to him.

**Researcher I**<br>
There indeed is none...

**Noah**<br>
Grasping the coding pattern of human memory means we can now duplicate it freely. Next, if we pair that with director... Mr. Wyle's physical enhancement research from two years ago, do you realize the meaning this represents?

**Researcher I**<br>
Of course... After that, if we can find a way to input memory into a physical vessel, it means an "eternal life" for humans!

**Noah**<br>
Yes. Unlike the Architects, an eternal life that actually belongs to humans... Bringing the company massive profits is nothing more than a by\-product of this process.

**Noah**<br>
Do you understand now, Ian? What we're writing now is the most important piece of history for the next generation of humans!

**Researcher I**<br>
U... understood! Director!

**Noah**<br>
Good. During the next department presentation, we'll show the higher\-ups the results we've accumulated so far... We'll be receiving more resources for our research very soon. By that time, everything will process even more smoothly.

**Researcher I**<br>
No problem. Thank you, director! I will definitely work extra hard!

**Noah**<br>
It'll be here soon... the "beacon" for humans...
