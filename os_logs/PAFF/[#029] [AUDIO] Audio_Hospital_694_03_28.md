**Clara**<br>
Daniel! Wait up!

**Daniel**<br>
Sorry... I don't know what's wrong with me.<br>
I need some space. Leave me alone, okay.

**Clara**<br>
I, I'll be with you...

**Daniel**<br>
I said leave me alone!

*\[Running\]*

**Clara**<br>
Ah! Daniel......! Waah!

*\[Crash\]*

**Noah**<br>
Are you alright? Oh, is that you, Clara? What's the matter?

**Clara**<br>
No, nothing. We're here to visit Aroma. Here, your phone. Sorry about that.

**Noah**<br>
No need to worry. Do be more careful in the hallways though.

*\[Running\]*

**Clara**<br>
Daniel!

**Noah**<br>
......

**Noah**<br>
... Sorry, someone ran into me just now. The preparations, they're all set, right?

**[Researcher A]**<br>
*Yes. One word from director and we can begin the operation at any time.*

**Noah**<br>
Good, but stay alert. This operation must only be carried out in secret.

**[Researcher A]**<br>
*Understood. For our aspirations.*

**Noah**<br>
Arnold, this is no longer just for our aspirations anymore.<br>
Aroma getting involved in this kind of thing... I can't accept it. I will save her no matter what. I still need to properly apologize to her...

**[Researcher A]**<br>
*Director...?*

**Noah**<br>
No, it's nothing... In short, I will leave this operation to you guys.

**[Researcher A]**<br>
*One more thing, about Helena...*

**Noah**<br>
I'll figure out a way to convince her.

**[Researcher A]**<br>
*She should be able to understand as well...*

**Noah**<br>
Yes. I won't allow anything to happen to Aroma again. We have to make sure she lives no matter what.

**[Researcher A]**<br>
*Absolutely!*

**Noah**<br>
Then that's it for now.

*[Call Ends]*

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Noah**<br>
Helena... Ah! Iris, it's been a while. Are you here to visit Aroma?

**Iris**<br>
Yes, I'm here to bring her the academic schedule. Ah, is there something important you want to discuss with sis Helena? It's about time I take my leave too. I will not disturb you guys.

**Noah**<br>
No need to be so modest. Please come visit more often. Aroma will be very glad to see you. Oh right; about your two classmates, I just saw them run away in a hurry.

**Iris**<br>
Those two... I'll go catch them. Thank you!

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Helena**<br>
Noah, Aroma reacted to her classmates just now. That's a great sign!

**Noah**<br>
Really? That's good to hear.

**Helena**<br>
With this progress, the surgery will definitely be successful too. Aroma will come back to us very soon...

**Noah**<br>
......

**Helena**<br>
Ah, I have to discuss something with the doctor...

**Noah**<br>
Helena! About the surgery next month...

**Helena**<br>
......

**Noah**<br>
... I'm still against it. A.R.C. is still months, even years away from completing the recreation of that technology. Yet they decide to rush and let the hospital run trials with it.

**Helena**<br>
This again... With Aroma's current situation, we can't afford to waste any time arguing about this.<br>
Plus, We signed the contract already. What else are you going to do?

**Noah**<br>
Maybe we should seriously consider going with what I proposed...?

**Helena**<br>
Stop bringing that up! Why on earth would I agree to that!? That project of yours was already discontinued by A.R.C. <br>
You've gone insane!

**Noah**<br>
You're the one who's gone insane! Compare to me, you rather trust that worthless doctor!?

**Helena**<br>
I......!

**Noah**<br>
I already saw through him. Even if that technology actually works, that useless hack doesn't have anywhere near the skills to pull it off! It's way too risky! <br>
I'm not handing Aroma's life over to someone who'll undoubtedly mess up!

**Helena**<br>
Aroma is my little sister! I will decide who I want to save her life!<br>
This is none of your business! Now p\*\*\* off!

**Noah**<br>
......

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Noah**<br>
I... I want to save her even more than you do...

*[Signal Lost]*
