**Susan**<br>
Here sis Vicky, coffee!

**Vicky**<br>
Thanks... Woah, it's this time already?

**Susan**<br>
It's already well past dinner time. Whenever sis Vicky starts working on a report, you never stop until it's done.

**Vicky**<br>
Fufufu... In order to reveal the truth to the public ahead of everyone else, missing a meal is no big deal at all! This is our job! Our duty! Our lives!

**Susan**<br>
Yeah, yeah, I know\~ Thanks for the hard work. I'll be leaving first. Hayato has a performance today! Bye\~!

**Vicky**<br>
We're publishing a new special issue tomorrow. Don't you dare come in late!

*\[Door Closes\]*

**Vicky**<br>
Alright. I'm definitely going to get this Ã†sir special done tonight!

*\[Ringtone\]*

**Vicky**<br>
... Unknown Caller? Hmph...

*\[Answers\]*

**Vicky**<br>
Tax administration, isn't it? I've seen this routine way too many goddamn times. Our company's accounting records are perfectly normal. There is none of that undeclared tax bulls\*\*\*! So stop bothering us!

**[N]**<br>
*... Unfortunately, you're wrong. I am not someone from the Administration Bureau. You're MIss Vicky Russell from 08 Daily, right?*

**Vicky**<br>
... Who are you?

**[N]**<br>
*That's not important. It seems that you've been investigating the incident of the missing idol PAFF. On top of that, you've already gotten some clues, haven't you?*

**Vicky**<br>
I have no idea what you're talking about. Besides, I am not obliged to disclose information to any random person, especially anonymous brats like you who pop out of nowhere.

**[N]**<br>
*Haha... I understand. Information is a precious commodity. You understand its immense value, of course, and will not give it up easily.*

**Vicky**<br>
Oh, spare me that rubbish. What exactly do you want?

**[N]**<br>
*Then I'll be frank: I would like to buy the information on PAFF's whereabouts.*

**Vicky**<br>
You're her fan?

**[N]**<br>
*... I have to find her no matter what.*

**Vicky**<br>
Oh, I see. Then let me tell you, my answer is "NO"!

**[N]**<br>
*So you don't want to?*

**Vicky**<br>
It's mega exclusive news that we're this close to getting. Why the hell would I want to give it up!?

**[N]**<br>
*Then, Miss Russell, allow me to make things clear... As a reward for the investigation, I can transfer a down payment of half\-a\-million dollars to your account within ten minutes.*

*\[Crashing\]*

**Vicky**<br>
H... Half\-a\-million!?

**[N]**<br>
*In addition, I've prepared a final payment of 1.5 million. Once I confirmed that the information is accurate, you will receive it immediately.*

**Vicky**<br>
... That's a lot of money...

**[N]**<br>
*I also know, that 08 Daily has very limited resources. The shortage of funds meant that you've struggled to get proper interviews... In order to compete with the big corporations, you had no choice but to make groundless accusations, blow things out of proportion and write sensational articles to get attention and revenue. Am I mistaken?*

**Vicky**<br>
You... How did you...

**[N]**<br>
*One just needs to read your previous columns and everything would be quite obvious... By letting me locate PAFF, your situation will improve as well. I believe this is a mutually beneficial transaction.*

**Vicky**<br>
But... I...

**[N]**<br>
*Don't hesitate, Miss Russell... I've seen your resume. You gave up a well\-paid position with Node News Network to join 08 Daily. You have a goal you want to pursue, right?*

**Vicky**<br>
......

**[N]**<br>
*Alright. Your reply is?*

**Vicky**<br>
... I get it... You almost persuaded me...<br>
BUT I REFUSE!

**[N]**<br>
*Miss Russell!? This is a once\-in\-a\-lifetime opportunity...*

**Vicky**<br>
I almost forgot my pride as a journalist... You want information? That get off your lazy a\*\* and go find it yourself!

*\[Hang Up\]*
