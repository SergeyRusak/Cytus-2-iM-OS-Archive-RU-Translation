*Mr. Smith, sorry for the interruption. Mr. Noah Black from R&D department 01 requests a meeting. His emotion numbers have reached stage Red. I have excluded him according to the security regulations...*

**Leo**<br>
It's alright, Samantha. Let him in.

**[System]**<br>
*Yes, Mr. Smith.*

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Noah**<br>
Leo, what the heck is this about? Why did our team's...

**Leo**<br>
Know your place, director. Your action itself is already a violation. You don't want my A.I. to put a bullet through you on the spot... This bearskin rug is an ultra\-rare SS class item, and it would be a shame to ruin it.

**Noah**<br>
... Sir, the R&D department is under your direct command. Please explain; why did you reject our project's publication request? On top of that, why did you take away our entire budget?

**Leo**<br>
It should be very clearly written in the instruction book. Your team will be moving on to other projects following...

**Noah**<br>
Don't give me that nonsense! The research has already entered its final stage. We're this close to producing a result that will influence generations to come! All members of the team are also in very high spirits... Why do we have to be transferred to other projects now?

**Leo**<br>
No need to rush... I can explain, director.<br>
Samantha, pour me a glass of Cognac.

**Leo**<br>
To be honest, director, I really admire the results your team produced. Once the memory duplication technology is completed, there will no longer be any secrets in this world. We can easily capture the brainwaves of important figures and obtain key information from any corner of this world. 

**Noah**<br>
... Sir, I see that you're very well\-versed in our research.

**Leo**<br>
Indeed, and that's also the exact reason why I discontinued your project. This technology is more dangerous than any firearm imaginable... I'm not certain if A.R.C. is prepared to accept it or not.

**Noah**<br>
No need to worry. I am well aware of the importance of this research. We will carefully inspect each and every possible failure to ensure that none will occur...

**Leo**<br>
I understand your determination. Despite that, I would like you to wait a little longer.

**Noah**<br>
Why?

*\[Drinks wine\]*

**Leo**<br>
You, as well as Phoenix back then, are all very excited about using the technology you have to help drive human evolution towards a brand\-new world. Am I correct?

**Noah**<br>
Absolutely. That's the responsibility of those with the power of "knowledge"!

**Leo**<br>
Then can you predict what the new world will look like?

**Noah**<br>
This...

**Leo**<br>
The instant such a major technology is publicized, every single tech organization in every Node will immediately begin researching it. No one can predict what the world will become. A.R.C. may seem untouchable right now, but in the new world... nobody knows.

**Noah**<br>
... Is the committee afraid of those changes?

**Leo**<br>
The committee has come to the consensus, that a change with too much risk and may cause the company harm is not A.R.C.'s current objective.<br>
However, once the time has arrived... you understand what I'm saying, don't you?

**Noah**<br>
I... I understand.

**Leo**<br>
Excellent. Samantha, pour a glass for director too.

**[System]**<br>
*Yes, Mr. Smith.*

**Noah**<br>
... Thank you, Sir.

*\[Drinks wine\]*

**Leo**<br>
Ah, right. About the plans for what's coming next... I will restructure R&D department 01 into an independent department "zero". It'll be a non\-public organization that exists outside the current structure. Of course, you'll be the director.

**Noah**<br>
... "zero"?

**Leo**<br>
That's right. The members will be distributed across each department, utilizing their excellent experience and assisting the operation of every project. As with you, you'll be handling research missions directly assigned by me.

**Noah**<br>
In other words... our team will be temporarily disbanded?

**Leo**<br>
This is for the greater good of the company... Of course, your salary will increase as well. I've written it all down on this document.<br>
Samantha.

**[System]**<br>
*Yes, Mr. Smith.*

*\[Projection\]*

**Noah**<br>
... That's a lot...!

**Leo**<br>
You've already brought A.R.C. profits that far surpassed this amount. It's only natural that you receive a significant pay raise.

**Noah**<br>
... What profit?

**Leo**<br>
Remember R&D department 02's research project? "Virtual Internet System"... codename "cyTus". It'll be A.R.C.'s major project for the next ten years.<br>
Your team's research results on brainwaves will be properly utilized by 02. It'll become the final piece of the "cyTus" puzzle.

**Noah**<br>
... That... I didn't know about that...

**Leo**<br>
I greatly appreciate the amazing contributions you've made for us, director. We'll continue to be in your care for the future... Remember, wait for the time to arrive.

**Noah**<br>
... Understood.

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Leo**<br>
... Samantha.

**[System]**<br>
*What is it, Mr. Smith?*

**Leo**<br>
Noah Black is a dangerous figure to A.R.C., and I don't want this "Ark" to encounter even the most insignificant of dangers.

**[System]**<br>
*Yes, Mr. Smith.<br>
I've begun adjusting the privileges and projects of department "zero". In the future, both Noah Black and "zero" will be under proper control and operate as your pawns.*

**Leo**<br>
Very good. A technology like you that completely surrenders to my commands is what humans truly need, Samantha.

**[System]**<br>
*Yes, Mr. Smith.*
