**Chris**<br>
That's more or less the situation. Miss White, what is your reply?

**PAFF**<br>
I... umm...

**Helena**<br>
Excuse me, I have some questions I would like to ask.

**Chris**<br>
Pardon me. You are...?

**Helena**<br>
I'm Helena, Aroma's older sister.<br>
I'll be blunt, Monophonic... Entertainment? Never heard of this name before... Your company wants to sign Aroma after seeing the show, is that correct?

**Chris**<br>
Ah, you're her older sister. Excuse us for the sudden contact. Yes, our CEO on\-site that day. After hearing Aroma's performance, he was blown away...

**Helena**<br>
No need for all that fluff. You can just cut to the chase.

**Chris**<br>
Oh... apologies.<br>
All in all, our CEO really liked Miss White's performance.

**PAFF**<br>
Thank you...

**Helena**<br>
However, you mentioned this "special packaging"; what is it? Sounds very vague.

**Chris**<br>
Our CEO thinks that with Miss White's appearance, elegance and performance traits, she will need to be packaged with the most suitable methods in order to achieve the best results...

**Helena**<br>
... It's all this unclear information about this part that makes me question you guys. To be honest with you, other agencies have already contacted us...

**PAFF**<br>
... Eh? Did we...

**Helena**<br>
Shush! Let me handle it.

*[»»» Fast Forward »»»]*

**Helena**<br>
... That's about it. Their plans are more transparent and clear. For safety concerns, I feel like they are the better choice.

**Chris**<br>
I understand. Miss White's reputation is at its peak right now. I expected other agencies to act first too...<br>
But! Our company has the chance to be the most resourceful agency in all of Node08. On top of that, we will devote everything we have to help Miss White. For the sake of her future, partnering with us is certainly the best choice!

**Helena**<br>
A chance is it...? Then that's not something you can promise, can you?<br>
However, I can feel your sincerity. Therefore, I will now offer a signing condition as Aroma's guardian.

**Chris**<br>
...Of course!

**Helena**<br>
Let me be her agent. I will monitor and participate in all your packaging plans.

**PAFF**<br>
... Eh!?

**Chris**<br>
You mean... yourself?

**Helena**<br>
Yes. I have worked at a public relations company before. My resume and performance are pretty good as well. I can send them to you right now. <br>
Only if you guys agree to this condition will we even consider signing the contract.

**Chris**<br>
Umm... I received the documents. Indeed, a very impressive resume... However, I can't make the decision right now. Would you allow me to go back and ask my superiors, then we can continue the negotiation?

**Helena**<br>
Of course, but let me remind you... based on the recent share of voice on the internet, as well as our ongoing cross\-comparison of other agencies, signing Aroma right now is your best investment. As the share of voice decreases with time, the value you can obtain will also decrease significantly. Please put this into consideration when making your decision.

**Chris**<br>
Yes, ma'am! I have a feeling... that you will be a great agent.

**Helena**<br>
I am only a good sister. I will look forward to your reply.

*[Call Ends]*

**PAFF**<br>
... Is that the right thing to do? Shouldn't we be a little nicer...?

**Helena**<br>
Idiot, how could I just hand you off to some random, out\-of\-nowhere small company like that?<br>
This is a great opportunity for your dreams to come true. Let me handle it.
