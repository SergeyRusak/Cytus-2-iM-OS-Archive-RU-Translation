Aroma... Aroma, wake up.

**PAFF**<br>
Umm... Sister? ... Mr. Asakura's car...?<br>
......! Where are we going!?

**Helena**<br>
......

**PAFF**<br>
N...... NO! Are you taking me to the lab...? I heard the conversation between you two. I'm not going!

**Helena**<br>
N, no, it's not what you think! Calm down first!

**PAFF**<br>
......

**Helena**<br>
... I previously don't know what I'm supposed to do. However, seeing this reaction from you... I'm relieved.

**PAFF**<br>
......?

**Helena**<br>
I'm taking you to "JOEZ Cafe" to meet up with NEKO.

**PAFF**<br>
Eh!?

**Helena**<br>
I got in contact with her. She informed me about the many things that had happened since you left... Need to return the car to them as well.

**PAFF**<br>
Sister...

**Helena**<br>
Don't call me that.

**PAFF**<br>
......!

**Helena**<br>
No... Sorry. My emotions are kinda messed up right now...

**PAFF**<br>
......

**Helena**<br>
Since you heard our conversation, then it should be easier for you to understand what I'm about to tell you.<br>
Right now, I... can't treat you as simply my little sister.

**PAFF**<br>
......

**Helena**<br>
The tone of your speech, your expressions... Compared to what they were before you ran away, I feel even more strongly about this now.

**Helena**<br>
It doesn't mean that you're not my little sister. It's that this body... doesn't belong solely to Aroma. The more I grew conscious of this, the more I didn't know what I should do...

**PAFF**<br>
I understand.

**Helena**<br>
Eh?

**PAFF**<br>
Because I have the same feeling as well... After I left you guys, those memories that don't belong to me became clearer and clearer... At first, they were still just some blurry, confusing images that felt very dated. But now... even the dream I just had felt as if it was something that just happened yesterday.  

**Helena**<br>
... Is that so...?

**PAFF**<br>
I... want to know who "the other me" is.

**Helena**<br>
... Looks like I made the right decision. Thank... good... ness...... Eh?

**PAFF**<br>
Sister...?

**Helena**<br>
Haha... Am I crying? I just felt like a weight was lifted off my chest...yet...I feel some sort of sadness...

**Helena**<br>
I always... always knew... that the real you was already gone that night... But once I admitted this, I had no idea what kind of feelings, or what identity I should take on when facing the current you... Even when you call me "sister", it just sounds so... unfamiliar... I... *\*Sobs\**...

**PAFF**<br>
... (Places hand on Helena)

**PAFF**<br>
Not calling you sister, that's... I can't do that. Our memories, and the years we spent together after I woke up, they didn't disappear... You are my older sister.

**Helena**<br>
......

**PAFF**<br>
No matter how many "me"s exist in this body; no matter where I go next, what happens afterward; no matter... whether you're able to treat me as your little sister or not... you will always be my sister. The sister I love more than anyone else in this world. So... please don't say something like that...
