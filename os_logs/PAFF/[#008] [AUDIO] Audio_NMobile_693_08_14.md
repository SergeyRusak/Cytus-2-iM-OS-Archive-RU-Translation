**Noah**<br>
It's been a while since we three had dinner together. I reserve this table a whole week in advance just for this occasion... This is "L'Atelier de Charlotte", Node 08's most renowned 5\-Star Buffet. Delicacies from all across the world can be found here. <br>
It's on me tonight. Eat whatever you desire.

**Helena**<br>
Wow, it must be quite expensive here. Are you alright with that?

**Noah**<br>
Aroma's making her debut tomorrow. You've been working really hard as well lately, haven't you? If it's for you guys, I said it's money well spent. No need to be concerned about it.

**Helena**<br>
You're being considerate for once, good.<br>
Those people at Mono really are a pain in the neck. It's truly exhausting to deal with them... Aroma, you must be hungry too, right? Don't go easy on his wallet.

**[Tuner-san]**<br>
*Hungry! Hungry!*

**PAFF**<br>
...... Ok.

**Noah**<br>
......

**PAFF**<br>
......

**Noah**<br>
So you're back? Let's not wait for you sister and dig in right now.<br>
... What's with the tiny portions? Is that enough for you?

**PAFF**<br>
... Where's sister?

**Noah**<br>
I just saw her walked pass here. She's probably waiting in line for the grilled meats. The ribs there are the signature dish of this restaurant, so there's always a long line. I highly recommend you go try it out yourself later.

**PAFF**<br>
Sure...

**Noah**<br>
......

**PAFF**<br>
......

**Noah**<br>
... A, Aroma, about that incident a few days ago... I'm sorry! I was just too drunk that day.

**PAFF**<br>
......

**Noah**<br>
I was feeling really frustrated that day. The higher\-ups have no idea about the importance of that technology... All in all, I got yell at by my superiors. On my way home, I decided to make a detour and visit a bar. I may had too many drinks there... Did I... I didn't do anything terrible to you, did I?

**PAFF**<br>
... Noah... so... you don't remember anything?

**Noah**<br>
I can only recall bits and pieces... I yelled at you, and I think I pushed you as well... I am so sorry!

**PAFF**<br>
... It was much more than just that...

**Noah**<br>
Hm? What?

**PAFF**<br>
... No, nothing...

**Noah**<br>
No matter what, let me apologize for what I did. I will never do that again!<br>
Does Helena know about this? I will have to apologize to her as well.<br>


**PAFF**<br>
...... NO!

**Other Diners**<br>
......

**Noah**<br>
Umm. Sorry for disturbing everyone... We're fine.

**Noah**<br>
Keep your voice down... Why did you shout all of a sudden?

**PAFF**<br>
You can't... let sister know about it.

**Noah**<br>
......

**PAFF**<br>
Noah, you said you will never do it again. I believe you... Don't tell sister anything about this incident...

**Noah**<br>
... Understood. I will not talk about it.<br>
Thank you for your forgiveness, Aroma.

**PAFF**<br>
It's ok. I know that your job is tough...

**Noah**<br>
......

**Noah**<br>
Thank you so much...

**PAFF**<br>
......

**PAFF**<br>
... Can you let go of me now...?

**Noah**<br>
AH! I'm so sorry... I'll go grab a cold drink to calm myself down. Aroma, what would you like to drink?

**PAFF**<br>
I don't know what options are there... Let me go get it.

**Noah**<br>
... Got it. Then get me a glass of orange juice with extra ice.

**[Tuner-san]**<br>
*Note: Orange juice, more ice!*

**PAFF**<br>
OK.

**Noah**<br>
......

*\[Smells hand\]*

**Noah**<br>
... Did I rush it? That's not good... Hehehe.
