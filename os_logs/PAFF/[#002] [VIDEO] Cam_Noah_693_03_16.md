**Noah**<br>
I'm home.

**Helena**<br>
Just in time. I am making coffee.

**Noah**<br>
Hmm, add a bit more sugar today.<br>
Where's Aroma?

**Helena**<br>
She's taking a bath... Hmm? Looks like she's just got done with that.

**PAFF**<br>
Ah, Noah... sorry. You can use the bathroom now.

**Noah**<br>
*\*Chuckles\** You don't have to be so cautious. We are living together after all. Just treat me like family.

**PAFF**<br>
Ok... thank you for letting me live together with you guys. It feels like I'm disturbing you two newlyweds though...

**Noah**<br>
No need to worry. Having you together with us makes Helena happier too. If I were the only one here, she would probably give me a long face every day. That would be quite the waste of that beautiful face, don't you think?

**Helena**<br>
Stop your flattering, it's gross...<br>
Aroma, do you want some coffee?

**PAFF**<br>
Ah, I'll pour it myself...

**Helena**<br>
No. You must be exhausted after a whole day at the studio, aren't you? You get some rest; I'll do it.

**Noah**<br>
Congratulations on second place. You were great!

**[Tuner-san]**<br>
*Congrats! Congrats*

**PAFF**<br>
......

**Noah**<br>
... Don't be disheartened. Compare to the first\-place winner, your performance created even more buzz on iM.

**PAFF**<br>
Eh?

**Noah**<br>
See for yourself...<br>
[No.12 is so cuuuute!! Her voice is amazing too!]<br>
[Ten times better than the actual winner, stupid organizer and their shady BS]<br>
[I'm in love. Can someone get me her iM account]...

**PAFF**<br>
S, stop reading them out loud! It's embarrassing... Also, the first\-place winner is much better than me...

**Noah**<br>
I saw the live stream. If we were to judge only by singing, then you are indeed the winner.

**Helena**<br>
Aren't you at work?

**Noah**<br>
The research department is not really busy these days due to that previous incident... Ah, right; the camera also caught you tearing up. How rare, seeing as you seem to have a poker face 24/7.

**Helena**<br>
... I, I did not!?

**Noah**<br>
If you don't believe, check the clip. It's been spreading like wildfire online already.

*[»»» Fast Forward »»»]*

**Helena**<br>
... Another listen and it's still as amazing as the first time. You indeed have the best singing performance.

**PAFF**<br>
You guys are exaggerating...

**Noah**<br>
Aroma, have some confidence in yourself. With that singing voice of yours, your dream of being a world\-class singer will come true one day. I guarantee it.

**PAFF**<br>
... Ok.

**PAFF**<br>
Even you are saying that... I will try my best, thank you. Feels like Noah is really good at comforting people. Your words calm people down... makes me a little jealous of sister, hehe.

**Helena**<br>
You're thinking too much. What good does this guy have?

**Noah**<br>
......

**PAFF**<br>
What's wrong?

**Noah**<br>
... Hmm? Ah, nothing. Is the coffee done?

**Helena**<br>
Should be almost done. I'll go check it out.

**Noah**<br>
Let me do it.

**Helena**<br>
You two tired folks should stop trying to take my job. Sit down.

**Noah**<br>
No, you were even more nervous than Aroma last night. You barely got any sleep, did you? I'll do...

**Helena**<br>
I SAID, SIT, DOWN.

**[Tuner-san]**<br>
*Detects Anger Emotion*

**PAFF**<br>
In times like this, it's best you listen to sister...

**Noah**<br>
Haha... seems like that's the case.
