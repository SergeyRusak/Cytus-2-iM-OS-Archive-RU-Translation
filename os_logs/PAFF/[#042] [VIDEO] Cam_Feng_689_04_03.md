*\[Singing\]*

**Kaori**<br>
*\*You and I. Just like butterflies, perfect hue and light.\**

**Kaori**<br>
... Hayato? You're there, right?

**Hayato**<br>
Ah... I just came back from a flower delivery... You saw me.

**Kaori**<br>
Why do you always hide so far away when I'm singing? You'd rather stand in the sun and get toasted? Is my singing that bad?

**Hayato**<br>
Of course it's not! It's just... your singing is so good, and I don't want to disturb you...

**Kaori**<br>
Nah, it's fine. Come inside! Grandma Feng is taking a nap inside the shop. That's why I came outside to sing.<br>
How's aunt Lin?

**Hayato**<br>
She's doing very well. She was so excited and kept telling me about how her son got accepted to study overseas at Node 08.<br>
It seems like the flowers she ordered from us is going to be used in the ceremony.

**Kaori**<br>
Node 08... That largest city?

**Hayato**<br>
Yeah. I heard that the people there don't need to pay offerings. There are many drones that help everyone out, and that there are a lot of musical performances too.

**Kaori**<br>
How nice... I would love to go there...

**Hayato**<br>
... Let's not talk about that. I have something to give you. Can you close your eyes?

**Kaori**<br>
Hahaha, I knew it! When I saw you keep hiding your hands behind your back, I knew you were up to something!

**Hayato**<br>
... Is it that obvious...

**Kaori**<br>
Hehe, okay, okay. My eyes are closed.

**Hayato**<br>
Here... You can open your eyes now.

**Kaori**<br>
This is... wow! It's lavender!

**Hayato**<br>
It's dried lavender flower... A while ago, when I passed by Genmu Boulevard, I discovered a place with lavenders growing everywhere. I picked some, took them back and dried them... This is your favorite flower, right?

**Kaori**<br>
Yep, I love lavender! According to grandma Feng, since I was little, I would always put a pot of lavender at my bedside before I go to bed. One time, grandma made a mistake and accidentally planted mealy sages instead. I ended up crying the whole night.

**Hayato**<br>
Haha, I remember that. You said you screamed, "They look alike but the smell is totally wrong!". Grandma Feng had quite the headache that day.

**Kaori**<br>
... I only mentioned this incident to Hayato once, right? I'm so glad that you remember all of it.

**Hayato**<br>
It's about Kaori. O... of course I'd remember.

**Kaori**<br>
Hmm? What did you say?

**Hayato**<br>
N, nothing.<br>
Sorry for disturbing you sing. I'll be going inside first...

**Kaori**<br>
Not at all! Hayato, can you get that for me?

**Hayato**<br>
... A flower pot? What are you going to do?

**Kaori**<br>
Check this out. You place it upside down...  Voil√†! A drum for Hayato!

**Hayato**<br>
Drums? The instrument you hit to make a sound?

**Kaori**<br>
Yep. I've always wanted someone to accompany me! Hayato, you've eavesdropped on my singing a lot, so you should be able to help, right?

**Hayato**<br>
I, I've never played drums before... Wait, you already found out that I was eavesdropping? When did you find out?

**Kaori**<br>
Hehe, that's a secret. I'm starting. Hayato, get ready!

**Hayato**<br>
Ah, o, okay!

**Kaori**<br>
*\*You and I. Just like butterflies, perfect hue and light.\**

*\[Drum noise\]*

**Kaori**<br>
......

**Hayato**<br>
......

**Kaori**<br>
Ahahaha! That was totally offbeat! This really is your first time playing drums!<br>
Hayato, you're so funny~!

**Hayato**<br>
I, I'm so sorry... T, this is not for me after all...

**Kaori**<br>
Aw, come on. It's okay!<br>
Here, I'll start again. You just follow my movement and tap your feet to the beat. Get ready~

**Kaori**<br>
*\*You and I. Just like butterflies, perfect hue and light.\**

*\[Drum noise\]*

**Kaori**<br>
Much better. I'll keep going!

**Kaori**<br>
*\*Though it rains down our fate. Start up today.\**

*\[Drum noise\]*

**Kaori**<br>
You're getting better and better! Maybe you do have the talent! That's awesome!

**Hayato**<br>
Whew... that was hard. But... it's also kinda fun!

**Kaori**<br>
Hehe, I made up my mind. Next time, we'll be singing on the streets for everyone. Then, when we both grow up... we'll go and perform at Node 08! We'll bring grandma Feng with us too!

**Hayato**<br>
You're exaggerating things again... haha.

**Kaori**<br>
*\*You and I. Just like butterflies, perfect hue and light.\**
