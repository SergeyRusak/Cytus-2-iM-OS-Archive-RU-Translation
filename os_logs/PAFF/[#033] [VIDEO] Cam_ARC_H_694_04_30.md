Network bridge activate, 88%... 89%...

**Researcher E**<br>
Interface synchronization complete, prepare to connect.

**Researcher U**<br>
Begin virtual connection.

**Noah**<br>
Please... please succeed...

Virtual connection... success! Thank goodness!

**Noah**<br>
Alright! I knew we could do it!

**Researcher U**<br>
Begin formatting the memory of the "vessel".

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

**Noah**<br>
Director, I really appreciate your help.

**[Phoenix]**<br>
*... I'm very interested in this project of yours too. Been a few years since we last met. You've become more like a director than I ever was.*

**Noah**<br>
I still got much to learn... like what I'm doing now. It's all for the trivial goal of saving a family member. Compare to your grand aspirations...

**[Phoenix]**<br>
*Aspirations, eh... I've done way too many despicable and brutal things in order to achieve those. "Appearance Cloning"... such a disgraceful technology, yet it was just one of the many dirty tricks I used to climb to the top.<br>
I had sealed this away for good...*

**Noah**<br>
I had to ask so many time before you finally agree to help. You have my sincere gratitude...

**[Phoenix]**<br>
*Your resolve to save her somewhat resonated with me. However, keep this in mind. What you have here was obtained by sacrificing an innocent life. Its price...*

**Noah**<br>
Yes... I know.

**[Phoenix]**<br>
*You... have truly changed.*

**Noah**<br>
......<br>
Nevertheless... This girl, she really does look exactly the same... With your support, the transformation really removed every single trace of her previous appearance.

**[Phoenix]**<br>
*Your wife... will she accept this?*

**Noah**<br>
She will accept it, and I will succeed.

**[Phoenix]**<br>
*Does having someone's appearance and memory make you "that" person?<br>
It really is fragile, isn't it? What we humans consider our basis of existence...*

**Noah**<br>
......

**[Phoenix]**<br>
*However, this is also precisely why it's so precious. The fact that you're willing to break this moral framework for science shows that you've grown quite a bit yourself too.*

**Noah**<br>
... I'm... I'm not what director described, in fact far from it.<br>
Aroma... she's someone I truly treasured, yet I did that to her...

**[Phoenix]**<br>
*Regardless of what sins you believe you committed, what you're doing now, working so hard to let her live, is perhaps the only way for you to atone for your sins*

**Noah**<br>
The only way for me to atone for my sins... is it?

**[Phoenix]**<br>
*Yes, even if you can't receive forgiveness, you still do it.*

**Noah**<br>
It feels like... director, you've changed as well.

**[Phoenix]**<br>
*... Maybe it's because I also have someone I care greatly about now, just like you.*

**Noah**<br>
... Yes, I care greatly about her... and I care greatly about this family. I don't want to see anyone in grief anymore.

**Researcher A**<br>
Memory formatting complete. Director! Everything is going smoothly so far!

**[Phoenix]**<br>
*These images... Are they the original memory of this girl?*

![pos3301.png](./attachments/pos3301.png)

**Noah**<br>
Yes. In this stage, we'll be formatting the memory of the vessel.

**[Phoenix]**<br>
*She was a very beautiful girl.*

**Noah**<br>
Yes, she was. But... sorry.

*\[Memory delete\]*

**Noah**<br>
......

**Researcher A**<br>
......

**Researcher U**<br>
......

**Researcher E**<br>
... This feels... a lot heavier than I imagined...

**[Phoenix]**<br>
*......*

**Noah**<br>
......

**[Phoenix]**<br>
*From now on, it'll be your time to shine. Go, save her.*

**Noah**<br>
Aroma... this is going to hurt a bit. Please, bear with it...

*[Signal Lost]*
