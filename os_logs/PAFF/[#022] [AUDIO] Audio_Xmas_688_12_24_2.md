**Shop Owner**<br>
Helena, ten\-minute break. Go see your little sister.<br>
Everybody, hang in there. It's almost over!

**Helena**<br>
Got it. Thank you!<br>
Aroma, are you bored?

**PAFF**<br>
Not at all. When sister is working hard, you look very cool.

**Helena**<br>
It's not like I purposely want to look cool though. I'm exhausted\~

**PAFF**<br>
Thanks for the hard work.

**Helena**<br>
Since I worked overtime tonight, I don't have a shift tomorrow afternoon. So, what do you want to do? Any place you want to go?

**PAFF**<br>
Not really. Going out means spending money. It's fine just staying at home with sister.

**Helena**<br>
It's a holiday though. We can still go on a walk somewhere, right? You know, to check out the Christmas decorations and such?

**PAFF**<br>
Hmm... I feel like it will be very crowded no matter where we go. It's a bit scary...

**Helena**<br>
Haha, alright. Staying at home it is then.

**Shop Owner**<br>
What!? You serious?

**Staff A**<br>
Yes... What should we do...?

**Helena**<br>
... What's the matter?

**Shop Owner**<br>
Our resident singer got caught in a massive traffic jam. She might be late for quite some time...

**Helena**<br>
EH!?

**Shop Owner**<br>
Damnit, we've got so many customers. A lot of them are here for the performance... The Christmas secret event is supposed to be the climax of today's show!

**Staff A**<br>
The crowd is getting more and more restless...

**Shop Owner**<br>
All in all, we can't just leave the stage empty like this. Got to figure out a way somehow!

**Staff A**<br>
......<br>
During the promotion, we didn't specify what the secret event is going to be, did we?

*[»»» Fast Forward »»»]*

**PAFF**<br>
... Eh? Me?

**Shop Owner**<br>
Please! Aroma's singing is great. 15 min... No! 10! Just stand\-in for 10 minutes and we'll be fine!

**Helena**<br>
Owner, this child is extremely shy. Telling her to sing on stage is...

**Shop Owner**<br>
I know! But...... Ah! Right! This, wear this to cover up your face. This way, nobody will know who you are! All you need to do is close your eyes and focus on your singing!

**Helena**<br>
Owner!

**PAFF**<br>
... I'll try. 

**Helena**<br>
Eh?

**PAFF**<br>
Sir treated me to some orange juice. I want to help...

**Helena**<br>
Aroma......

**Customer A**<br>
Why hasn't anything started! Where is the show?

**Customer B**<br>
Yeah! I want a refund, old man! Haha!

**Shop Owner**<br>
Shut your pie holes! Hmph, you guys are going to see the best show ever right now, let me tell you.

*\[Music\]*

**Customer C**<br>
Eh? A child?

**Customer D**<br>
Hey! We want to see a sexy lady\~ When has this place become an art class for kids?

**PAFF**<br>
*\*All the store lights<br>
Shining so bright<br>
Warm the chill in the air<br>
Through their doors stream melodies of winter\**

**Audience**<br>
......!

**Customer A**<br>
Wow\~ Tonight's show was incredible!

**Customer B**<br>
Especially that opening with the little girl wearing a mask! Her voice is beautiful... I wonder who she is?

**Staff A**<br>
Thank you for coming!

**Shop Owner**<br>
Thank you so much for the help today. You can leave now. We'll handle the cleanup afterward.

**Helena**<br>
Thank you. Good work, everyone.

**Shop Owner**<br>
Aroma, thanks a lot for today! Come visit us again someday.

**PAFF**<br>
Ok!

**Helena**<br>
In the end, I wasn't able to spend Christmas with you... sorry.

**PAFF**<br>
I don't mind... I feel like I already experience a wonderful Christmas. Thank you, sister.

**Helena**<br>
Good to hear that\~ Aroma, Merry Christmas.

**PAFF**<br>
Yes... Merry Christmas.
