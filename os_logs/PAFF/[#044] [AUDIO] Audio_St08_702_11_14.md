*\[Door Opens\]*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Kenta, is anyone outside?

**Kenta**<br>
No one in sight! They're all at the front door!

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Shh! Too loud!

**Yukiko**<br>
It's okay, NEKO. The front door is quite far away from here. The sound won't travel that far... Let's wait for Kouhei here.

**PAFF**<br>
I'm sorry... for causing you guys all this trouble...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Aroma\-chan, you need to stop apologizing!

**Yukiko**<br>
NEKO's right. This is really all the help we can offer you too... Hope you can remember more things after you get to that bar...

**PAFF**<br>
Yes...

**Kenta**<br>
Ummm... Miss PAFF...

**PAFF**<br>
Ah, your name is... Kenta, right? What's the matter?

**Kenta**<br>
Miss PAFF... Can I have your autograph?

**PAFF**<br>
This is... my album?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Ha!? Ya little brat, when did you buy this... and this one of all things! The album where the Mono bastards cheated NEKO out of all the songs I wrote!

**Kenta**<br>
I just like this one the most... Big sister's songs are all so good...

**PAFF**<br>
NEKO... Can I sign it?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Umm... Y... yeah, you can.

*\[Signs\]*

**PAFF**<br>
Here, Kenta.

**Yukiko**<br>
Thank you, Miss PAFF... Kenta, remember to say thank you.

**Kenta**<br>
T, thank you, Miss PAFF!

**PAFF**<br>
......

**PAFF**<br>
NEKO... That album, Mono purposely chose to not put your name on it... You were right to be angry. I am really sorry.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
... Oh that. Nah, it's fine. No big deal... So you did find out?

**PAFF**<br>
My sister just told me that it's company policy. I only knew about the details later when I asked Chris about it... What they did was awful. I've always wanted to properly apologize to you. You wrote such amazing songs too...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
I, it's not Aroma\-chan's fault either! The ones that deserve the blame are Chris and the other idiots at Mono! It was also kinda NEKO's fault since I did spew a lot of random crap back then. Xenon chewed out NEKO for the same reason too ahahaha!

**PAFF**<br>
Thank you... NEKO's music really is amazing. If I have the opportunity, I would love to sing for NEKO's songs again.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
For real? Of course I'm down for that! Once Aroma\-chan remembers everything, NEKO will write a few more awesome songs for you to sing! And we will have a collab with Xenon, ah, and Sis Cherry too... Hehe, maybe we can even get ROBO to organize a LIVE for everyone!

**PAFF**<br>
S...sure. Haha.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Hoho~ Is this what it feels like to get carried?

**PAFF**<br>
Carried? What does that mean...

*\[Alarm\]*

**Men In Black**<br>
Unit A has located the target. Initiate apprehend operation immediately.

**Kenta**<br>
Big sister! So many people!!

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Yikes! What are you people trying to do!?

**Men In Black**<br>
... Miss Aroma White, we are here to pick you up. Please don't resist. We promise that we won't use any violence.

**PAFF**<br>
M... me?

**Yukiko**<br>
You people... aren't Miss PAFF's fans, I suppose? Where are you trying to take Miss PAFF to?

**Men In Black**<br>
This has nothing to do with outsiders. Please step away.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Who's gonna let you suspicious folks take Aroma\-chan away! She still has to sing NEKO's new songs! NEKO's gonna i, inform the admins!

**Men In Black**<br>
... Apprehend the target.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
R... run! Aroma\-chan!

**PAFF**<br>
O, okay!

**Men In Black**<br>
You're not getting away. Go after her! Surround them!

*\[Honking\]*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
That's... daddy? It's daddy's car!!

*\[Engine Sounds\]*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Aroma\-chan, get in the car!!

**PAFF**<br>
Ah... U, understood!
