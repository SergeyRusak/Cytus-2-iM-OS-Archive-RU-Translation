**Helena**<br>
Is she awake!?

**Researcher A**<br>
Mrs. Helena, you can't come in yet...

**Helena**<br>
Aroma!

**Researcher E**<br>
Director, the test is not...

**[Noah]**<br>
*It's fine. Let her in.*

**Helena**<br>
Thank goodness! *\*Sobs\**......

**PAFF**<br>
...... Ummm......

**Helena**<br>
What's wrong? It's me.

**PAFF**<br>
Who... are you...?

**Helena**<br>
Aroma......?

**PAFF**<br>
Aroma... is that...me? Who... am I?

**Helena**<br>
......

**Researcher A**<br>
......

**Researcher E**<br>
......

**[Noah]**<br>
... Helena, I'm sorry... There are still some examinations we need to perform. Please leave the room first.

**Helena**<br>
......

**Researcher A**<br>
Mrs. Helena, please rest assured. At the very least, she can talk normally. Her cognition seems to function properly as well. We will try our best to...

**Helena**<br>
... Enough.

**Researcher A**<br>
......

**Helena**<br>
Noah... I believe you.

**[Noah]**<br>
*... I know. Leave it to me.*

**Researcher U**<br>
Director, all tests are complete. Her nervous system is reacting normally. <br>
Health condition is also recovering well. We're supplying her with nutrients right now.

**Noah**<br>
... Reset the parameters. Prepare to try again with configuration no.8.

**Researcher U**<br>
...... Eh?

**Noah**<br>
We still haven't succeeded. It shouldn't be like this...

**Helena**<br>
Noah... stop it.

**Noah**<br>
No! Aroma's memory should be activated by now!

**Helena**<br>
Do you not realize that you're torturing a live human being!? She's already awake with her senses intact. That's enough!

**Noah**<br>
I......!

**Helena**<br>
... Enough is enough. This is not the you I know.

**Noah**<br>
......

**Helena**<br>
Aroma's memory... does indeed exist inside this body, correct?

**Noah**<br>
Yes...

**Helena**<br>
Then we have a chance to awaken that memory. We can bring Aroma back with a softer, less\-invasive treatment method. We can, right? Uriel?

**Researcher U**<br>
That's certainly possible...

**Helena**<br>
Please, let it end here...

**Noah**<br>
Ummm...

**Researcher U**<br>
Director...

**Noah**<br>
......

**Noah**<br>
Turn off the machine.

**Researcher U**<br>
......

**Noah**<br>
I need to calm down. Leave me alone. Please.
