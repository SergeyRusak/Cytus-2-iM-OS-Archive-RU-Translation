Ha... ha! Excuse me!

**Pedestrian**<br>
Waahhh!

**Vicky**<br>
Stop! NEKO! PAFF! Stop right there!

**Pedestrian**<br>
Is that... NEKO and PAFF?

**Pedestrian**<br>
It really is them!

**Pedestrian**<br>
Quick, take a picture!

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Oh god, oh no! This is bad! This is really, really bad!

*[→Signal Switches]*

**Vicky**<br>
Waah!

*\[Falls down\]*

**Hayato**<br>
Sis Vicky!

**Vicky**<br>
Don't worry about me! Keep chasing!

**Hayato**<br>
I can't do that!

**Vicky**<br>
Damnit! Shouldn't have worn heels...

**Hayato**<br>
Sis Vicky, you twisted your ankle... Can you walk?

**Vicky**<br>
Yeah, I can... Oww! That hurt...

**Hayato**<br>
... It looks swollen. You need to get it treated as soon as possible. Here, I'll carry you.

**Vicky**<br>
...... (Offers hand)

**Hayato**<br>
Hnngh... Ha!

*\[Footsteps\]*

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

**Vicky**<br>
......<br>
... Why didn't you keep chasing them!? You dumba\*\*! I'm going to deduct your salary!

**Hayato**<br>
Ow, that hurt... I'm not going to catch them at that distance. There were many pedestrians between us too.

**Vicky**<br>
You slowed down on purpose, didn't you? When she kept turning around to look at you.

**Hayato**<br>
......

**Vicky**<br>
What you said back at Daniel's place... Those were all true, weren't they?

**Hayato**<br>
......

**Vicky**<br>
As a professional journalist, I can clearly tell that you're already investigating this story from a completely personal angle. I'm certain that there's still a lot more you know regarding this case, many of which I'm totally unaware of, right?

**Hayato**<br>
... Guess I can't hide it from sis Vicky anymore... Sorry for not telling you. I was afraid that if I do, you would definitely treat it like exclusive news and write tons of reports on it. I didn't want that to happen...

**Vicky**<br>
Sighs... By now, that so\-called exclusive news is already gone with the wind... Take a look. It's all over iM now, that little chase scene we had back there.

**Hayato**<br>
Woah...

**Vicky**<br>
In terms of this news report, it's my utter defeat. I was totally out of the loop throughout all this. Tell me everything you know, will you?

**Hayato**<br>
......

**Vicky**<br>
Rest assured. Judging by how you look at her... she is currently in some kind of danger, right? If this news report involves the safety of a person's life, I will back out. I still uphold some basic business ethics, after all.

**Hayato**<br>
Can you promise...?

**Vicky**<br>
I, Vicky Russell, is exceptional at putting out questions, confutations, speculations and discussions. However, that does not include prevarications. The one thing I loathe the most in life is knowing the truth yet telling a lie on purpose. This is also the reason why I was able to survive in this industry for such a long time.

**Hayato**<br>
Haha... Now that I think about it, it is true. Sis Vicky tends to just cut through all the crap and get straight to the point.

**Vicky**<br>
Besides, the determination you showed back there, that will to catch up to her no matter what... It reminds me a little of what I used to be... 

**Hayato**<br>
Eh?

**Vicky**<br>
Don't mind me. All in all, setting aside my role as a journalist, I really want to know the story between you and her.

**Hayato**<br>
... I... I grew up in Node 03, together with a girl named "Kaori"...
