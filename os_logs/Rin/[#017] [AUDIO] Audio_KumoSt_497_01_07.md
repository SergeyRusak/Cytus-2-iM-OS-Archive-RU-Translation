**Takano**<br>
You ready?

**Rin**<br>
Takano... You're also in Ghost?

**Takano**<br>
Yazawa!? Katsuya, why'd you bring her here?

**Katsuya**<br>
......

**Rin**<br>
I wanted to come.

**Katsuya**<br>
You know what happened to her, right?

**Takano**<br>
... Yeah. Luckily, everyone in our squad is a student, so our mission isn't that dangerous——main thing is to wait for the signal then cut the power in this building. The adults will take care of the Blessed; but you've still got to be careful, got it? 

**Katsuya**<br>
Got it.

**Takano**<br>
What happened to your parents today... I'm really sorry.

**Katsuya**<br>
... No one thought it would turn into this.<br>
In any case, all this will be over soon.

**Rin**<br>
......

**Takano**<br>
You bring a gun? Just in case.

**Katsuya**<br>
Yeah. Rin, do you know how to use it? This is a pulse gun. There isn't any kickback. Just aim it at the target and fire.

**Rin**<br>
Oh...

**Takano**<br>
We hope we won't need to use it... Alright, let's go.

*\[Signal Flare\]*

**Takano**<br>
Okay, everyone get ready!<br>
3... 2... 1!

*\[Cut Power\]*

**Rin**<br>
......

*\[Gunshot\]*

**Katsuya**<br>
It's begun...

**Takano**<br>
We can't stay here, everyone retreat.

**Katsuya**<br>
... Take Rin outta here, I'm going in.

**Takano**<br>
......!? <br>
What are you talking about? Stick to the plan.

**Katsuya**<br>
I promised Rin that I'd get revenge!

*\[Sprints\]*

**Rin**<br>
Katsuya!?

**Takano**<br>
... Shhh!<br>
Don't chase him! It's too dangerous in there! We've got to go!<br>


**Rin**<br>
No... NOO!
