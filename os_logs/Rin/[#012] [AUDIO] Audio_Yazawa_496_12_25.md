**Katsuya**<br>
It's so late... Rin, you really don't need me to stay?

**Rin**<br>
Yeah... I'm fine.

**Katsuya**<br>
... Okay. Try to get some rest. I'll come check on you tomorrow.

*\[Door Closes\]*

**Rin**<br>
......

**Rin**<br>
Dad... Mom... 

*\[Door Knock\]*

**Rin**<br>
... Katsuya? Did you forget something?

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
... Rin... it's me.

**Rin**<br>
......!<br>
Unit\-Unit 10?

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
I'm sorry, running here all of a sudden... I just wanted to tell you. My service position has been reset to the architecture team. Starting tomorrow, I won't be able to take care of the plants... and I won't be able to see you again.

**Rin**<br>
......!

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
I know Mr. Katsuya won't forgive me, so I waited until he left to talk to you... You... are you willing to open the door?

**Rin**<br>
......

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
... I... Um... Perhaps you aren't able to trust me anymore, but please listen to me, just a bit... Please.

**Rin**<br>
......

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
What happened at the institute, that was my fault... I couldn't rescue Mr. Yazawa and others in time...

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
But... ! I didn't do it!<br>
Before, a strange Architect came to talk with me... He was basically like me, an Architect with his own consciousness... No...

**Rin**<br>
......!?

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
That Architect said that I'm not completely awakened. That I'm still under the control of my protocol. All I needed to do was work a little harder and I could cast it off. But I was too scared, so I didn't do anything. I acted like I didn't know anything...

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
I don't know if it was them who did it... but... I definitely felt like it was them who did that to the institute. I tricked myself into thinking something like this would never happen... If I had only warned everybody ahead of time, perhaps nobody would be dead. Your parents, the people in the institute, they'd all still be alive.

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
Mr. Katsuya was right, I killed them...<br>
I'm... so sorry.

**Rin**<br>
......!

*\[Slumps Over\]*

**Rin**<br>
...Dad, Mom...

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
Rin? Are you there?

**Rin**<br>
... 

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
... Rin, once we talked about how our voices sound alike... Do you remember?

**Rin**<br>
......?

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
That may just be a coincidence... But after knowing you, I've been so happy every day. Not like before, when I was scared of humans. Gradually, I began to like them... I can't help but think, that this coincidence might mean something...

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
As an Architect, I always thought that I'd be like this forever. But since we have similar voices, maybe, just maybe... I can be like you, and live a normal life...

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
I really hope there's no barrier between us... Whether or not Architects have their own consciousness, I hope that one day we can live together in peace... Stupid, right? Hoping for something that'll never happen, then destroying it with my own hands... What am I, anyway...?

**Rin**<br>
...Unit 10...

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
Haha, Architects... I don't even have the ability to produce tears... I'm obviously upset, but I can't cry...

**Rin**<br>
...

*\[Notification\]*

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
It's a command for my new work... I must go.<br>
Rin, I just want to let you know, whatever happens... As long as I can hear my own voice, I won't forget you. That's all I can be sure of.

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
Thank you, Rin. Thanks for everything you did for me.<br>
... Good\-bye...

**Rin**<br>
......

*[»»»Fast Forward»»»]*

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Rin**<br>
... It's already... day?

**Rin**<br>
......!<br>
This calendula... Did Unit 10 bring this...?

*\[Slumps Over\]*

**Rin**<br>
What on earth...should I do...?
