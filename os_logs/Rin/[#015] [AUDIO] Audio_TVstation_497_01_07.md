*After all of these incidents, there is no way that we can trust that Architects are safe! Believe me when I say that many people have encountered such situations. We want humans to take over the Administration Bureau and determine all of their policies! That way we can reduce the interactions and meddling that Architects have in human life!*

**Rin**<br>
Katsuya... this...

**Katsuya**<br>
Don't worry, the people at the studio will need some time to figure out where the source is coming from. We'll complete the mission before that happens.

**TV Station Worker A**<br>
What are you doing here!?

**Rin、Katsuya**<br>
!?

*\[Footsteps\]*

**TV Station Worker A**<br>
Was that you who busted into studio 5? That notification was right... Who said you could come in here!

**TV Station Worker B**<br>
Sir, the channel's signal has been switched off! These are the scumbags that did it! Quick, notify the Administration Bureau!

**Kensho**<br>
Wait, we're almost finished! Please, we need to tell everyone our position...

**TV Station Worker C**<br>
Position? Let humans take over the Administration Bureau? I get it, you're those people who've been causing chaos all over the place recently. Those people who want to get rid of Architects, am I right?

**TV Station Worker B**<br>
Ha, you've got to be kidding me. Without the Bureau, I'll bet they couldn't even turn on the lights in their house. Idiots!

**Katsuya**<br>
What'd you say? This is for the safety of mankind...!

**TV Station Worker D**<br>
Shut your mouth! Whatta you guys want? Ridiculous, the only ones who are bothering people are you.

**Katsuya**<br>
... Oh...

**[Speaker]**<br>
*This! This is proof that humans have been under constant persecution by Architects! How many loved ones must we lose? How much tragedy must we endure? When will we accept the truth? From now on, open your eyes!*

**TV Station Worker B**<br>
None of this makes any sense! An Architect takes care of my daughter. Without them, I'd have to give up my job.

**TV Station Worker C**<br>
A few Architects have issues and you get all scared, exaggerating this to high heaven, am I right? If you've got a problem, make an appeal to the Administration Bureau.

**Katsuya**<br>
Please, listen. The Administration Bureau is managed automatically by the core protocol of an Architect. That's why we advocate these principles. We don't want to eradicate all of the Architects. We just want to create a management system that humans can trust...

**TV Station Worker E**<br>
You finished? Scram! I'm having the Bureau send some people over!

*\[Pushes\]*

**Rin**<br>
Wah!

**Katsuya**<br>
Hey! What are you doing!?

**TV Station Worker**<br>
Hey! Don't push!

*[→Signal Switches]*

**Mauro**<br>
... It's about time. Move out.

*[→Signal Switches]*

**[Enforcer Drone]**<br>
*Conflict detected, you are disrupting the peace, please stop immediately.*

**Katsuya**<br>
......!?

**TV Station Worker A**<br>
Wah... How'd they get here so fast?

**[Speaker]**<br>
*Excuse me, they made the first move...*

**TV Station Worker F**<br>
Waaahhhh!

*\[Crowd in Chaos\]*

**TV Station Worker E**<br>
Hey! People are fighting!

*\[Crowd in Chaos\]*

*[»»»Fast Forward»»»]*

*\[Crowd in Chaos\]*

**Katsuya**<br>
How… How did this happen!? Rin!? Where are you!?

**Kensho**<br>
Katsuya! It's too dangerous! We must leave!

**Katsuya**<br>
Dad, Mom! Rin!? Rin's gone! We've got to find her!

**Kensho**<br>
Uh... we can't, we must leave. The Blessed probably crept in and instigated this. If it keeps up like this, the situation is going to get out of hand...

**[Enforcer Drone]**<br>
*Conflict detected, you are disrupting the peace, please stop immediately.*

*\[Shots Fired\]*

*\[Crowd in Chaos\]*

**TV Station Worker**<br>
Waaahhhh!

**TV Station Worker B**<br>
Someone's got a gun! Run!

**[Speaker]**<br>
*None*

*\[Shots Fired\]*

**TV Station Worker C**<br>
Someone... Someone's been shot!

**Kensho**<br>
Katsuya! Let's go, now!

*\[Consecutive Shots\]*

**Katsuya**<br>
Damn! This is way too much...

**Kensho**<br>
Those bastards! They were just dying for this to happen!
