**Rin**<br>
Huff... This is good right? This is the best place in my Academy for getting some sun.

*\[Footsteps\]*

**Student A**<br>
Watch out! Ball!

**Rin**<br>
Ah!

*\[Catches ball\]*

**Katsuya**<br>
You alright?

**Rin**<br>
Ey? I\-I'm fine.

**Katsuya**<br>
Hey! Can't you see there are people here!?

**Student A**<br>
Sorry, sorry.

*\[Footsteps\]*

**Katsuya**<br>
Geez...

**Rin**<br>
Um... Thank you...

**Katsuya**<br>
No\-No need! You're okay, that's all that matters... Eh? In your hand, that's...

**Rin**<br>
This? It's a calendula. There's not enough sun in my house, so I brought it to the Academy.

**Katsuya**<br>
The sorrow of parting.

**Rin**<br>
Huh?

**Katsuya**<br>
Oh! I mean that's what the calendula means in the language of flowers, the sorrow of parting. But I believe it also means that good things will soon come your way.

**Rin**<br>
Wah... How'd you know that? That's amazing!

**Katsuya**<br>
No, no. It's my brother, he loves useless knowledge like that. Recently, he's been obsessed with the language of flowers. He talks about it every day, so I picked it up without even knowing it.

**Rin**<br>
So your brother's the amazing one?

**Katsuya**<br>
Hey! My dad and him always team up on me and call me a dumb meathead. My mom has been nagging me for not learning from him. He was just given a smarter brain...

**Rin**<br>
Sounds like a lively house.

**Katsuya**<br>
You mean super noisy!

**Rin**<br>
Hahaha... but...

**Katsuya**<br>
But what?

**Rin**<br>
I'm kinda jealous... I don't have any siblings and my parents are always busy at work, so they usually aren't around.

**Katsuya**<br>
......

**Rin**<br>
It's okay! I always go to their work and bug 'em! Plus, I'm used to it...

**Katsuya**<br>
I can hang out with you...

**Rin**<br>
Eh?

**Katsuya**<br>
... Er, no... I mean, we can hang out and talk, you know! I don't know much about flowers, not so good at that... But I know a lot about exercising!

**Rin**<br>
Po...POAHAHA!!

**Katsuya**<br>
Wha\-What are you laughing at?

**Rin**<br>
Nothing... Thanks.

**Katsuya**<br>
......

*\[Gust of wind\]*

**Rin**<br>
The wind's pretty strong... eh? What're you looking at me like that for? Is there something on my face?

**Katsuya**<br>
What!? No, I'm looking at the flower, not you!

**Rin**<br>
Oh, yeah... Ah! It's a little late... I've got to go! We'll talk soon!

**Katsuya**<br>
Oh... okay, bye.

*\[Footsteps\]*

**Katsuya**<br>
Ah! Wait! Your name...

**Student B**<br>
Rin! What are you still doing here? Come with me!

**Rin**<br>
Ah! Okay!

*\[Footsteps\]*

**Katsuya**<br>
Rin... your name is Rin...
