*\[Data Input\]*

**Researcher B**<br>
Equilibrium coefficient... 3... 3.5...

*\[Error\]*

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
Oh...

**Researcher A**<br>
Failed again, forget it. We'll stop here.

**Researcher B**<br>
... Aigh. Unit 10, you can head back. We'll take it from here.

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
Apologies.

*\[Door Closes\]*

**Researcher A**<br>
I told you before. Letting these error ridden Architects perform tasks is not as good as us just...

**Researcher B**<br>
There's nothing we can do. There's alreay not enough time. Our budget only allows us to apply for these kinds.

**Researcher A**<br>
I've checked. This unit has assisted in Yazawa's research institute before. It's been said that it was her who started that fire... It's clearly a malfunction. Why hasn't the Administration Bureau recycled her?

**Researcher B**<br>
Her model is for data analysis. Her previous service records are impeccable. These types of units that make one mistake, the Administration Bureau puts on the observation checklist, then sends them to second tier labs like ours to work.

**Researcher A**<br>
Unacceptable. Tomorrow I'm going to talk this over with the boss and see if we can switch it for another model. Otherwise, these malfunctioning models are simply a waste of time.

*\[Grabbed\]*

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
Wah!?

**?????**<br>
If you don't want anything to happen, then don't make a noise.

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
Oh......

*[→Signal Switches]*

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
It's you again... Wh\-what do you want from me!?

**Mauro**<br>
We'd like your help.

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
I... I told you that I don't want to help you hurt anybody...

**Mauro**<br>
Never thought a coward like you would be so persistent... Will you be able to sit back and do nothing when we are all destroyed by humans?

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
......!?

**Mauro**<br>
Due to previous events, some humans have already joined together and formed an organization, named Ghost, to oppose Architects. You didn't hear?

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
......!<br>
That's because you... Dr. Yazawa's institute... You did that!?

**Mauro**<br>
... That's right. You know what's next. No matter how you much you like humans, they've only always wanted you as a slave, a secondary lifeform. They'll never believe you.

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
... No...

*\[Projection\]*

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
......!<br>
These are...

**Mauro**<br>
I'm telling you now, the Blessed's headquarters is in Node 13. This is what it looks like there. Look at how they're treating us.

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
... Oh...

**Mauro**<br>
You and that human... Yazawa Rin, you two are still in contact, no? There's a human she is close with——Kawasaki Katsuya, he has joined Node 03's opposition organization. We want you to find out where their headquarters is.

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
......

**Mauro**<br>
We want you to do this because this is the most effective way. Plus, that way you will see clearly what human nature is really like. Of course, if you refuse, there are many other ways we can reach our goal.

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
......

**Mauro**<br>
You're not performing so well at your new job, are you? You can't see yourself clearly. The stupid emotions caused by humans are affecting your judgment. If it continues like this, you will be seen as a defect and destroyed by the Administration Bureau. Sent to the Shelter to be reproduced.

**Mauro**<br>
If you join us, I can guarantee that this will not occur. If us the Blessed are scanned and found to have consciousness that doesn't match the protocol's designed logic, then we will meet the same fate. But we have all survived.

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
......

**Mauro**<br>
... After all this talk, you're still unwilling to help. Tsk, what a shame...<br>


**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
No... I...

**Mauro**<br>
Eh?

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
I haven't been in contact with Rin... They think I killed her parents... Of course I haven't gotten close to Katsuya.

**Mauro**<br>
Is that so?  You don't appear to be lying. I'm foolish to have believed in that false friendship between you and that human...<br>
Forget it, you're already of no use. Should I allow you to stay here until the Bureau destroys you, or take care of you myself...

*\[Notification\]*

**Mauro**<br>
......?

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
It's a notification from the Administration Bureau. I must report back... If I don't report back within the time limit, they will trace my signal to here. You will certainly be involved...

**Mauro**<br>
Are... are you threatening me? Not so cowardly after all...

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
No, it's not that...

**Mauro**<br>
Forget it, leave.

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
Eh?

**Mauro**<br>
We've no time to waste on you. In any case, there's no way you can understand the meaning of a fully awakened one. Go ahead, follow your protocol and be destroyed.

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
... Please! Don't harm Rin or Katsuya!

**Mauro**<br>
I didn't come here to negotiate. Get out of here, before I change my mind.
