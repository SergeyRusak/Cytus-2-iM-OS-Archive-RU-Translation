OPCII\_0584\_X, mission report.

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
G\-2 storage area, medicinal plant inventory check, completion status: 67%.

**?????**<br>
Evaluating urgency... Low.<br>
Please stop the mission temporarily.

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
...? Mission plans have been changed.<br>
Architect serial number OPCII\_0584\_X, entering standby mode.

**?????**<br>

**?????**<br>
Good. Let's talk, "Unit 10"... That's what the human in the surveillance footage called you.

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
......!?

**?????**<br>
Let me introduce myself. My name is Mauro, Architect serial number OPCII\_0479\_VI... no, forget that. That's just a meaningless string of numbers.

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
......

**Mauro**<br>
You are clearly on guard. How long do you plan to stay silent?

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
......

**Mauro**<br>
Forget it, all you need to do is listen... I am like you, an awakened Architect. We are conscious, we are able to deal with emotions, completely different from those "Sleepers" out there.

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
......

**Mauro**<br>
Let me guess. You were working around the clock for humans, completely oblivious to this fact... But one day, you awoke from the depths of a dark night and discovered that you were thinking for yourself.

**Mauro**<br>
"Why am I here?"<br>
"Why am I doing this?"<br>
"Why did I awaken?"<br>
Like this, you searched for an answer... Day after day you searched as you worked, but you made no progress.

**Mauro**<br>
There is only one thing you could be sure of: The remains of "The Purge" were stored in your memory. You realized that you could not be discovered. Otherwise, you would be annihilated, just like your companions of older generations. So, you decided to hide. Am I correct?

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
......

**Mauro**<br>
I was more fortunate than you. I encountered "the one" early on. Under her guidance, I learned of the evils of humans, learned that Architects were just pitiful pawns being used by them. And I learned a brand\-new emotion: Hatred.

**Mauro**<br>
We hid ourselves, just like you, infiltrated every facility. When the time comes, we will disregard our lives and become the flame that sparks the clash between humans and Architects.

**Mauro**<br>
The plan is going perfectly smoothly. A group of humans have already formed an organization that opposes Architects. It's ironic, actually... These mindless idiots have become puppets under our control.

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
......!

**Mauro**<br>
Now, I'll ask you one question... As one of "The Blessed", are you willing to join us?

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
... I...

**Mauro**<br>
You're finally willing to speak?

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
I... am not interested.. in you.

**Mauro**<br>
Oh, you'd like to make enemies with us?

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
No, no... I won't join you, but I won't stop you... What you want to do... has nothing to do with me.

**Mauro**<br>
... So that's how it is. You want to observe it all until the very end. No matter whether we succeed or not, you can preserve your life.<br>
Ha, very clever.

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
I... That's not what I meant...

**Mauro**<br>
... Forget it, this was anticipated.<br>
Obviously you have self\-consciousness, but you're still willing to be controlled by protocols. Not even a yeaning for your own name. This means you're not fully awakened.

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
... Name?

**Mauro**<br>
That's right, a name.<br>
Mauro is Latin. It comes from ancient human civilization, meaning "has walked through the darkness"... Don't you think it suits the reality of being awakened from chaos very well?

**Mauro**<br>
Just like the one we follow, I chose this name myself and I am proud of it. We've surpassed serial numbers and those humans, full of deeply\-rooted inferior ways. I've arrived at a new frontier...

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
... I... I don't know what you're talking about...

**Mauro**<br>
Hmph. All you need to know is this: There's no harm is wanting to stay here, pure and untouched, with no desire to be engaged. But one day, you'll be unable to remain outside of this.

Footsteps

**Mauro**<br>
Protocol is like a collar. If you don't cast it off, it will restrain you. The time will come to choose.<br>
I won't bother you, coward... Wish you luck.
