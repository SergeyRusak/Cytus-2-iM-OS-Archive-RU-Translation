**Rin**<br>
Katsuya!? Katsuya!?

**Citizens**<br>
Run!!!

*\[Bang\]*

**Rin**<br>
Waahhh!

**Mauro**<br>
Conflict detected, you are in violation of the Public Assembly Act, please disperse immediately.

**Rin**<br>
Eh? I\-I didn't do anything...

**Mauro**<br>
... Is that you? Yazawa Rin...

**Rin**<br>
Eh...?

**Mauro**<br>
Don't be scared, you'll be able to see your mom and dad soon.

**Rin**<br>
......!<br>
You... you're the one Unit 10 told me about...

*\[Draws Gun\]*

**Rin**<br>
......! No...!

**Katsuya**<br>
Rin!!

*\[Gunshot\]*

**Katsuya**<br>
Waahh!

**Rin**<br>
Katsuya!

**Katsuya**<br>
Run, now!!

*\[Sprints\]*

**Mauro**<br>
... Hmph.

*[→Signal Switches]*

**Rin**<br>
Katsuya, you're injured!

**Katsuya**<br>
It's nothing! Huff...

**Rin**<br>
Where's your mom and dad...?

**Katsuya**<br>
They...*\*sob\**...

**Rin**<br>
... No...? It can't be...

**Katsuya**<br>
Rin... get ready. Tonight, it's going down...

**Rin**<br>
Going down...?<br>
Eh!? A gun!?

**Katsuya**<br>
I'm sorry, I lied... this event, it was to draw the Blessed in... Our leader got their communication records. They knew we were holding an event, planned on causing a riot from within...

**Katsuya**<br>
Never thought that they'd fire on the crowd... But we've already found their meeting location, it's just... ugh...

**Rin**<br>
You... what are you saying? I have no idea what you're talking about! Your injury...

**Katsuya**<br>
Rin! Listen to me... This is our last chance... at revenge, for what the Blessed did to our family... We must make them pay! They must be eliminated! It doesn't matter if anyone else understands, this is for all of mankind!

**Rin**<br>
Oh...

**Katsuya**<br>
Think about your mom and dad! Don't you want justice!?

**Rin**<br>
But using violence...

**Katsuya**<br>
There's already... no other way! Listen, we already know exactly how many of them there are. We must root them out, then we'll be one step closer to our goal!

**Rin**<br>
...*\*sob\**...

**Katsuya**<br>
......!<br>
I'm sorry... I lied to you, got you into such a dangerous situation...

**Rin**<br>
Katsuya... There must be another way.

**Katsuya**<br>
The Blessed you saw at the television station... That's the one that worked at your parent's institute, right? I'm afraid he might have had something to do with their deaths, you must at least get him... If you don't want to join then I won't force you, but I'm going back.

**Rin**<br>
... I can't let you go alone.

**Katsuya**<br>
I'm not alone... all of us who've become victims because of the Architects... the organization will be with me!

**Rin**<br>
... I can't... let you go alone! I'm going with you...

**Katsuya**<br>
......<br>
You ready?

**Rin**<br>
... Yeah.
