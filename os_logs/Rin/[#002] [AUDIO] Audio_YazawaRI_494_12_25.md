......

**Yasushi**<br>
Rin, wake up!

**Rin**<br>
...*\*yawn\**... \~ ahhh, Dad?

**Yasushi**<br>
What are you doing sleeping at the research institute? Don't you have class in the afternoon?

**Rin**<br>
Dad, did you forget? It's an exam day, we got off at noon.

**Yasushi**<br>
... Oh, yea? I forgot.

**Rin**<br>
I mentioned it at the table...

**Yasushi**<br>
Yeah? What's the matter?

**Rin**<br>
Nuh\-Nothing.<br>
What about Mom?

**Yasushi**<br>
Asa's in the lab, I'm about to head there as well.

**Rin**<br>
Oh... Can I go watch?

**Yasushi**<br>
No. The research into the florigen of Arabidopsis is entering its final stage. If the simulation of today's atomic structure is successful, it'll be a big step forward for us. Rin, just think about it. If humans could control the time that any flower blossomed... 

**Rin**<br>
... Yeah, yeah, yeah, cut it out already! Dad, did you forget that your daughter's not a botanist!

**Yasushi**<br>
Oh, okay... Anyway, we're gonna leave around 7 today. You wanna head home first?

**Rin**<br>
But... nobody else is at home.

**Yasushi**<br>
Rin?

**Rin**<br>
... Whatever, I'll just wait until you're off. Can I do my homework in the lounge? Just like I used to.

**Yasushi**<br>
Alright, I'll have an Architect take you there.

*[Call Starts]*

**Yasushi**<br>
Administration, this is researcher H7301 Yazawa Yasushi, please send an Architect over to escort a guest.

**[Administrator]**<br>
*This is Nakamura. Received. Dr. Yazawa, I'll arrange it immediately... Did Rin come for a visit?*

**Rin**<br>
Hehe, Mr. Nakamura, good afternoon.

**Yasushi**<br>
Apologies, sorry to bother you...

**[Administrator]**<br>
*Not at all, she's always been a good girl. She never bothers anyone. She even helps out occasionally. Oh, yea, Rin, did you get that album I asked you to pick up for me?*

**Yasushi**<br>
... Nakamura, this is a public line, you know.

**[Administrator]**<br>
*Ah, ahh hahaha... the Architect will be right there!*

*[Call Ends]*

**Yasushi**<br>
Aigh... Rin, what kind of album did he ask you to get? It's not contraband, is it?

**Rin**<br>
Relax, it's just a folk album. It's a new album by an artist Mr. Nakamura likes. It's got an ancient feel, really unique! I'll let you have a listen later tonight! 

**Yasushi**<br>
Your mother and I spend every day interacting with plants, we don't know anything about music. Forget it.<br>
Ah, the Architect is here.

*\[Footsteps\]*

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
Hello, Mr. Yazawa.<br>
I am Architect No. OPCII\_0584\_X, at your command.

**Yasushi**<br>
Unit 10? Please escort my daughter to the lounge.

*\[Scanning\]*

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
Report: Detecting Yazawa Rin's knee has suffered a minor scrap wound.

**Yasushi**<br>
Eh? Really? What's the matter?

**Rin**<br>
Ah, this? It's nothing. I just fell down at the Academy, that's all. It'll be fine soon.

**Yasushi**<br>
How do I not know about this?

**Rin**<br>
I already told you...

**Yasushi**<br>
Unit 10, pick her up and take her there.

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
Command received, executing immediately.<br>
Ms. Yazawa, apologies.

**Rin**<br>
Eh? No need, I can do... wah!

*\[Picks Up Rin\]*

**Rin**<br>
... it myself...

**Yasushi**<br>
Nope. You need to rest before it heals.

**Rin**<br>
Robots' bodies are so... cold.

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
... Apologies.

**Rin**<br>
......?<br>
I'd rather have my dad hug me.

**Yasushi**<br>
Aigh... so affectionate.<br>
But I gotta go find Asa.

**Rin**<br>
Ok... See you later, Dad\~say hi to Mom!

**Yasushi**<br>
Don't go running around.
