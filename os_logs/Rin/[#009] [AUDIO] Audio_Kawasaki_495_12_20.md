**Rin**<br>
Katsuya... You've become so thin...

**Katsuya**<br>
......

*\[Hugs\]*

**Rin**<br>
...*\*sob\*...\*sob\**...

**Katsuya**<br>
... I'm sorry, I've made you so worried. Come in.

*[→Signal Switches]*

**Katsuya**<br>
My brother was attacked by an Architect at work who was supposed to be helping him. The Administration Bureau said the Architect was stopped immediately... but it was already too late.

**Rin**<br>
... Do they know why?

**Katsuya**<br>
Who knows? "Sudden aberration", "No cause found"... All we got were these kinds of reports and a lot of money... Like they can just buy my brother back or something...

*\[Object Crashes\]*

**Katsuya**<br>
Ha, Haha... We don't even understand the pathways in the Architects brains, yet we rely on them to manage everyday life, let them run around in the city...

**Katsuya**<br>
... At least now, I can protect myself.<br>
Rin, let me show you something.

**Rin**<br>
...... Ahhhh!!<br>
Gun... A gun!?

**Katsuya**<br>
This is a pulse gun. Its destructive power is many times stronger than a regular bullet. It can even pass through an Architect.

**Rin**<br>
H\-H\-How'd you get this thing...!?

**Katsuya**<br>
I didn't tell you? We joined Ghost. They gave it to us.

**Rin**<br>
What's... Ghost?

**Katsuya**<br>
It's an organization formed by people who oppose Architects. They've been hiding underground in 03 for many years. They've infiltrated the Administration Bureau's system and organizations, carrying out attacks on Architects and the maintenance facility... Just like a ghost. My parents attend their meetings.

**Rin**<br>
Isn't... Isn't that a terrorist group?

**Katsuya**<br>
Terror? What's more terrifying than the Architects?

**Rin**<br>
... Katsuya...!

**Katsuya**<br>
After joining I learned that there's always been people who've been killed by Architects. It's just that the Administration Bureau covers it up. Ghost has taken up arms to protect people... to stop the same pain from happening to more people.

**Rin**<br>
B\-But, we're only 15 years old.

**Katsuya**<br>
... The youngest person to be attacked was a 5\-year\-old girl. An Architect destroyed a support beam, causing her to be crushed under a several ton concrete block... along with her 7\-year\-old sister.

**Rin**<br>
......!

**Katsuya**<br>
You get it? Age, sex, whatever. In the face of those executioners it doesn't matter! So I'm ready for battle!

**Rin**<br>
... *\*sob\*... \*sob\*...*

**Katsuya**<br>
Rin, are you still going to the research center?

**Rin**<br>
... Yeah... anything wrong?

**Katsuya**<br>
Stop going. There are too many Architects there. If something happens, even if I have a gun, I won't be able to keep you safe.

**Rin**<br>
Don't worry, Mom and Dad will take care of everything... Plus, Unit 10 is there! If other Architects have an error, she'll definitely know...

**Katsuya**<br>
......

**Rin**<br>
... Katsuya?

**Katsuya**<br>
Unit 10 is just like them. You'd better break off that relationship.

**Rin**<br>
Katsuya!? How, how could you... You don't trust her? She's our friend!

**Katsuya**<br>
... The cause of my brother's death was a stab wound. A fatal wound to the back. The Architect didn't even have a gun, it used its hand... stabbed him in the back.

**Rin**<br>
......!

**Katsuya**<br>
He had no means to protect against them. Trusted them to the very end... And look what it got him.

**Rin**<br>
… *\*sob\*... \*sob\*...*

**Katsuya**<br>
... Sorry, I really don't understand Architects. We can't be friends with them.

**Rin**<br>
Katsuya... Unit 10, she's...

**Katsuya**<br>
I get it that Unit 10 has no ill\-will towards us, but she's just not a human. If she happens to be like those Architects with "Sudden aberrations", well...

**Rin**<br>
... I... I don't know!<br>
I'm going back!

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Katsuya**<br>
... Rin... I'm doing this for you...
