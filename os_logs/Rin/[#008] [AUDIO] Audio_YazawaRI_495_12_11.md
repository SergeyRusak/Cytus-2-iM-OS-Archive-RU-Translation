**Rin**<br>
Unit 10, you wanna go out shopping in a bit?

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
Yes, Rin. I need to get some plants and medicine for the lab... What's the matter?

**Rin**<br>
Do you always come right back after buying stuff? You wanna go check out a plant expo today?

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
Ey!? A plant expo... but... my work...

**Katsuya**<br>
Rin, you'd be a bad influence on Unit 10 with all your running around, okay?

**Rin**<br>
I'm not gonna be a bad influence on her! I just want her to see a lot more. Just for a bit, real quick!

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
B\-But...

**Rin**<br>
Come on, come on. If we leave now we can still make it. You two, come with me!

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
But, Rin... Don't push me! Wah!

**Katsuya**<br>
Hey! Wait for me!

*[â†’Signal Switches]*

**Rin**<br>
Wah, so many beautiful flowers! Unit 10, what you think?

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
Um... Lily of the Valley, an ornamental plant. Highly toxic. When using as medicine one must be very careful... It likes partially shaded environments and its flowering phase is about 2 weeks...

**Katsuya**<br>
Sounds like she's not even listening to you...

**Rin**<br>
Hahaha, no worries. As long as she's happy... Eh? What's this? Looks like a girl dancing.

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
Rin, that's an Oncidium. Due to the blossoming period, the shape of the flower looks like a dancing dasmel. Another name for it is the Dancing\-Doll Orchid...

**Rin**<br>
Wah! What a cute name! Ah, there's some more flowers over there. I'm gonna go take a look!

*\[Hurried Footsteps\]*

**Katsuya**<br>
Wait! Rin...! Aigh... gone...

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
Ah... yeah...

**Katsuya**<br>
You can keep looking, don't worry about me. I'll just wait for her here.

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
It's okay... It would be rude to leave Mr. Katsuya alone...

**Katsuya**<br>
......

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
... Now that I think of it, this is the first time I've spent time with you one\-on\-one. Not really used to it...

**Katsuya**<br>
Yeah. I mean, Rin is so outgoing, it's usually her doing most of the talking.

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
Yes... It's not that easy...

**Katsuya**<br>
... To be honest, you're rather shy. It's hard to believe that you could be friends with Rin.

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
Really...? I'm so happy to be friends with Rin. Of course, I'm happy that we're friends as well.

**Katsuya**<br>
... When Rin first mentioned you to me, I actually couldn't believe it. I always thought Architects were robots and couldn't understand emotions...

**Katsuya**<br>
Thinking about it now, do I really understand what Architects are... It's a little hard for me to say... but to put it simply, it must have been... fear? I don't understand, so I'm afraid.

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
Don't understand... so you are afraid...

**Katsuya**<br>
In the end, people and Architects are different. When we come across different... um, species, we'll instinctively be frightened.<br>
... Ah, what am I even talking about?

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
I think... that I understand.

**Katsuya**<br>
... Do you also feel fear?

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
Yes... I think that if I didn't know Rin, I would be afraid to face humans... I think that is what you mean by "different".

**Katsuya**<br>
......

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
Um... What about you? Are you still afraid of me...?

**Katsuya**<br>
It's still a little bit weird, but... assuming that other Architects are like you, with their own consciousness and emotions, perhaps...

*\[Phone Rings\]*

**Katsuya**<br>
Ah, let me get this...<br>
Hello...? Yes, this is Kawasaki Katsuya.

**Katsuya**<br>
......! WHAT ARE YOU SAYING!?

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
Mr. K\-Katsuya? What happened!?

**Katsuya**<br>
... My brother... my brother!
