**Sagar**<br>
We're here.

**Bruno**<br>
Let's start removing the cargo.

**Sagar**<br>
Hey, do it gently.

**Bruno**<br>
... Got it.

*\[Cargo Removed\]*

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
Where... is this?

**Sagar**<br>
A.R.C.'s Node 08 Headquarters. Next, they're going to take you in for some tests.

**A.R.C. Employee A**<br>
Appreciate it. We'll take it from here.

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
Wah!

**Sagar**<br>
Hey, wait a second. The procedure has not been completed. Where are you taking her?

**A.R.C. Employee B**<br>
The higher\-ups determined that this is a grade\-one artifact, so from now on out we've been given complete authority in handling it.

**Sagar**<br>
... Before the testing procedure is complete, she remains the property of the squad. I have the right to know how she'll be handled. Or is your rank higher than mine?

**A.R.C. Employee A**<br>
... Uh, we're just following orders. Alright, come with us, only you.

**Sagar**<br>
Everyone, mission's over, head back and rest. I'm gonna check this out.

**Alex**<br>
...I mean, we found an Architect that can move, seems a little much, no? Looked like way too many people.

**Lucy**<br>
No, I heard that's the first time anyone's ever found an Architect that can move.

**Alex**<br>
Really? That means we're the s\*\*\*, yeah!? Whatta you say? Big B?<br>
... Big B, what's the matter?

**Bruno**<br>
Huh? Oh, nothing.

*[→Signal Switches]*

**A.R.C. Employee A**<br>
Initiate synchronization procedures, connecting to Library Port 2, entering model command code: 058410.

*\[Apparatus Activated\]*

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
Oh......AHHHHH!!!!

**Sagar**<br>
Hey! What are you doing!?<br>
Stop! You're going to break her!

**A.R.C. Employee A**<br>
Synchronization amplifying, 12%... 13%...

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
AAHHHH!! NO...NOOO!!!!

**Sagar**<br>
Hey! I said stop! You didn't hear me!?

*\[Bodies Collide\]*

**A.R.C. Employee B**<br>
Wah!? Mr. Sagar! Please do not interrupt our work!

System Error

**A.R.C. Employee A**<br>
... Synchronization failed.

**A.R.C. Employee B**<br>
Let's try another port.

**Sagar**<br>
Enough. I won't allow you to continue.

**A.R.C. Employee A**<br>
Mr. Sagar, you have the authority to observe the artifact, but are not permitted to obstruct us. This is a command from the highest levels. If you're going to cause a scene, I will have to ask you to leave.

**Sagar**<br>
Oh...

*[»»»Fast Forward»»»]*

*\[System Error\]*

**A.R.C. Employee A**<br>
Still nothing... Looks like that's it for today. If we continue it'll be too much of a burden for her.

**Sagar**<br>
Had enough? I may not know what you're up to, but you won't be able to get what you're after.

**A.R.C. Employee B**<br>
We will continue tomorrow. If you have a problem, then please bring it up with the higher\-ups.

**Sagar**<br>
Who issued the command?

**A.R.C. Employee B**<br>
Mr. Leo.

**Sagar**<br>
Got it. I'll go find him now.<br>
You okay?

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
Ugh... *\*sob\*... \*sob\*...*
