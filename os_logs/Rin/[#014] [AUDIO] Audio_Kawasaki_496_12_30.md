**Katsuya**<br>
Rin, time to eat.

**Rin**<br>
... I'm not hungry.

**Katsuya**<br>
No way, you need to eat a little. My mom already cooked some for you.

**Rin**<br>
Well... I guess it'd be rude to not eat any.

**Katsuya**<br>
That's right, come on.

**Rin**<br>
Umm... thanks for letting me live here.

**Katsuya**<br>
After going through all that, living in an empty house alone would make anyone go crazy, wouldn't it? If you want to thank my parents, why not do it when we all sit down?

*[→Signal Switches]*

**Rin**<br>
... I'm full.

**Katsuya**<br>
There's still so much left over...

**Kensho**<br>
Katsuya, what about you?

**Katsuya**<br>
Um, I'm not that hungry...

**Kensho**<br>
Why don't you two eat a little bit more?

**Nazuki**<br>
Kensho, leave them alone. Don't force them. They're clearly full. Here, I'll clean the table.

**Rin**<br>
Mrs. Kawasaki, the food was delicious. Thank you!

**Nazuki**<br>
Not a problem\~ I should thank you. After Katsuya's brother left, he's been down in the dumps. He's been much happier after you came. The dining table has also been a lot more lively.

**Katsuya**<br>
......<br>
We're gonna head back to the room.

**Kensho**<br>
Katsuya... about that thing...

**Nazuki**<br>
Kensho!

**Katsuya**<br>
... I know, I'll see.

*[→Signal Switches]*

**Rin**<br>
Your mom makes great food. I've haven't eaten... mom's food in so long. Always so busy, usually just order take\-out.

**Katsuya**<br>
Try not to think about that stuff.

**Rin**<br>
... It's only been a short time, I'm not sure I can. Sorry...

**Katsuya**<br>
Rin, there's something... I want to talk to you about.

*[»»»Fast Forward»»»]*

**Rin**<br>
Join Ghost?

**Katsuya**<br>
Yeah. I'm sure that now, you can understand why we think what we do. You know, our principles. Architects are simply not safe at all.

**Rin**<br>
So does that mean... we're enemies?

**Katsuya**<br>
No... it's nothing extreme like that. Right now, most people can't understand our position. We want to use some speeches and events to let people know the dangers of using Architects. Even one more person will give us a lot more power.

**Rin**<br>
Speeches? How are you gonna do that?

**Katsuya**<br>
Next week is the opening ceremony for a new exercise park in Node 03. Many people will tune into the on\-site broadcast. We've paid off some people in the media. We'll sneak our leader into the television studio. All we need to do is adjust the source of the signal and we can broadcast the image of our leader speaking for everybody to see.

**Rin**<br>
......

**Katsuya**<br>
To be honest, this probably won't be able to change anything anyway, right? After all, most Architects are normal. People are used to this kind of life.

**Katsuya**<br>
But our leader has already found some information concerning those Architects who have attacked humans. It's been said that it started in Node 13. He guesses that their leader is probably there as well, gradually gaining power and eventually issuing commands to every Architect in the world.

**Rin**<br>
......!

**Katsuya**<br>
We're not sure why they're doing this, but the ones who can receive the commands are the malfunctioning Architects... like Unit 10.

**Rin**<br>
... Unit 10...

**Katsuya**<br>
There's no doubt she's already become one of "The Blessed". The more of those types of Architects there are, the more dangerous it is for us humans.

**Rin**<br>
I... I still am not sure...<br>
A while ago...  she actually came to my house looking for me.

**Katsuya**<br>
......!?<br>
She didn't do anything, did she!? Why didn't you tell me?

**Rin**<br>
No, I was so scared, so I didn't open the door. She just stood outside and talked to me through the door.

**Katsuya**<br>
What'd she say?

**Rin**<br>
... Basically explained what happened with the fire... I don't know if I should believe her.

**Katsuya**<br>
Rin, listen. The Blessed have developed human\-like thoughts and actions due to a system error. They can even simulate human emotions. Do not trust them lightly. My brother, that's why he... If you ever run into that type of situation again, you've got to hide far, far away, understood?

**Rin**<br>
...... Yeah.

**Katsuya**<br>
Anyway, we're taking action next week. Are you willing to help? If you come, you'll see that what we're doing is for the good of everybody.

**Rin**<br>
Okay, if It's just for a bit...

**Katsuya**<br>
Thank you.
