Wait, Rin... Maybe we shouldn't do this...

**Rin**<br>
Eh? Didn't we agree already?

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
It's okay if you know, but another person...

**Rin**<br>
Don't worry! Katsuya promised me that he wouldn't tell anyone!

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
I trust Rin... but... won't he think I'm weird? I'm clearly an Architect...

**Rin**<br>
Don't worry, he's a good person... Katsuya! Here!

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
Ay, Ay\-ya!

*\[Footsteps\]*

**Katsuya**<br>
Rin! I finally found you. I've never been here before... Your parents aren't gonna pop out of nowhere, are they?

**Rin**<br>
Relax, they're busy. You nervous? Heehee.

**Katsuya**<br>
No!<br>
So, by your side... that's...

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
It\-It's... I...

**Katsuya**<br>
Wah! You're really like a person?

**Rin**<br>
Hey, she's a little timid. Don't frighten her.

**Katsuya**<br>
... Aren't I the one who's frightened?

**Rin**<br>
Hmph. Whatevs.<br>
Unit 10, this is Katsuya!

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
Hel... Hello...

**Katsuya**<br>
... Eh... Hello.

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
......

**Katsuya**<br>
......

**Katsuya**<br>
...... Hey, what's going on?

**Rin**<br>
... Hahaha!!<br>
You two are so embarrassed!

**Katsuya**<br>
That... that's normal! I've never really spoken with an Architect! Plus, with this weird kind of...

**Rin**<br>
Katsuya! How could you? That's so rude! Don't you forget, that flower is only living because of Unit 10's help!<br>
Without it, we'd never be together...

**Katsuya**<br>
That's true... Thank you, uh... Unit 10.

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
It's\-It's nothing...<br>
... Is the flower, is it doing well?

**Katsuya**<br>
Rin planted it at the Academy. It's pretty healthy.

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
Really? Excellent, I've been worried! If you want a flower to blossom even more vigorously, you can carefully remove the peripheral buds. That way the flower bud will get enough nutrients. Besides getting some sun, you also want to pay attention to the wind and pests, then it'll grow even better...

**Katsuya**<br>
... Uh...

**Rin**<br>
... Okay, okay, stop!

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
Ah! I...

**Rin**<br>
It's always like this! You just keep talking about flowers and plants, just like my dad...

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
S\-Sorry... My memory unit... there's a lot of info on plants and horticulture stored on it... If I'm not careful...

**Katsuya**<br>
...*\*smirk\**...

**Rin**<br>
Katsuya? What's up with that smile?

**Katsuya**<br>
Nothing, I just think...<br>
... You're very interesting, Unit 10.

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
I'm... interesting.

**Katsuya**<br>
Yup. I thought you'd be more like a robot, but after hearing you speak... it kinda changed my mind. No wonder you became friends with Rin.

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
...! Mr. Katsuya...

**Rin**<br>
Hey, whatta you mean "no wonder"?

**Katsuya**<br>
It's nothing... Unit 10, very nice to meet you.

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
... Indeed!<br>
I'm... It's so nice to meet you as well!
