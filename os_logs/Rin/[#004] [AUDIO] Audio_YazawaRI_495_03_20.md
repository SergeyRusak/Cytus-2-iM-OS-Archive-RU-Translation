## Log Content
**Rin**<br>
Unit 10! I found you!

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
Rin? I'm on patrol...

**Rin**<br>
Take a look at this flower! Its leaves are yellow, could it have been bitten by an insect?

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
Is this... the calendula that Dr. Yazawa bought you?

**Rin**<br>
Yeah, now I'm responsible for taking care of it, but I'm not a botanist...

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
Why not ask Dr. Yazawa and them to take a look?

**Rin**<br>
No way! They'll yell at me for sure... "How'd you let it get like this!"...

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
Haha... Let me take a look.

*\[Scans\]*

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
No sign of pest damage, but its color and hydration data reveal that its state of health is not optimal... Has it had enough sun?

**Rin**<br>
Not much, there's not a lot of sun in my room... What should I do?

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
The weather system in Node 03 is set for 12 hours of sunlight per day, beginning at 6 a.m.... All you need to do is let it get some sun for a period of time each day and its condition should improve.

**Rin**<br>
But after class I always go to the research center...

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
Hmm... Why not ask the Architect at your home to help?

**Rin**<br>
We haven't applied for home care, so there's no Architect there! Just us three.<br>
Ah, Unit 10, do you want to come to our home?

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
M\-Me...?

**Rin**<br>
Yeah, that way we can talk every day. I have nothing to do when I don't go to the research center.

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
B\-But, I've been sent here for work... If the Yazawa family applies, according to the rules, another Architect will be sent to your home...

**Rin**<br>
Oh... So it's not possible?

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
... That is correct.

**Rin**<br>
Darnit, Architects' are so frustrating.

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
Haha... We were designed to be like this.

**Rin**<br>
You're the only one who's different... I feel like there's something special about you. Hmm, well are there any other units like you? One that laughs, gets scared, can think...

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
I\-I'm not that special. Rin... I must still obey commands.

**Rin**<br>
But don't you think work is a drag? You're helping people do stuff all day and never get a chance to rest.

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
I...

**Rin**<br>
Be honest, Unit 10.<br>
I always feel like doing homework sucks──

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
Yes... But you must continue to attend to your studies at the Academy.

**Rin**<br>
... Yes! At the Academy!

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
Wah! That was sudden...

**Rin**<br>
I can let the flower get some sun in my Academy! The Architects and drones won't care, and mom and dad won't see it... Plus, that way I won't have to take care of it every day!

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
So that's been the point all along...

**Rin**<br>
Hehe, you got it. Unit 10, help me keep this a secret! You can't tell mom and dad!

*\[Notification\]*

**Rin**<br>
Wah! What's that light?

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
It means I still have work to do... Sorry, Rin. I must return. I hope I will have time to see you in a bit...

**Rin**<br>
......

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
Rin?<br>


**Rin**<br>
I've always wanted to ask... Unit 10, don't you think our voices sound very similar?

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
Eh? Voices?

**Rin**<br>
I noticed it a long time ago! If you don't believe me then take a listen.<br>
Ah\~Ahhh\~

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
...! You're right... Quite similar.<br>
However, Architect's voices are formed randomly. There's no set rule... Perhaps it's just a coincidence.

**Rin**<br>
... Perhaps...
