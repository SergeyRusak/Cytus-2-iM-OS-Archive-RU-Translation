**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
......<br>
...... Rin...

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
......

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
So still...

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
I... hurt humans. The Administration Bureau should have sent an Architect to recycle me long ago...

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
Outside... I don't see a single human... What on earth happened...?

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
......

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
I always knew that my existence would sooner or later cause problems...

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
You said... You lost people you cared for, so you wanted to end your life. At the time... I couldn't understand what you meant...

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
But I... I thought many times, if I were obliterated, would it be... But, I'm scared, so scared... I tried with all my might to not let this happen again, and yet the result was...

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
I don't have any idea what I am... to the Architects, I'm just a malfunctioning defect; to humans I'm not even close to a qualified Architect; and to the Blessed...

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
All this... You can't even hear me anymore, can you...?

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
Is this... death? It looks exactly like you're sleeping... Perhaps death is not as scary as I imagined...

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
Humans believe that you go to another world when you die. I... Can I see you in that world...?

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
......!<br>
Can't stay here... a grave. After dying, humans are put in a grave. Is that how they get to the other world? It must be!

*\[Digging\]*

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
This should do it? Rin...

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
I don't know... if when an Architect is shut down that means they are dead, and I don't know if Architect's death and human's are the same...

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
If I want to go to another world, I must have to go in a grave... an Architect's grave...

**Citizen A**<br>
Is that... an Architect...?

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
!?

**Citizen B**<br>
They haven't disappeared! Is she digging a grave...?<br>
Hey! Over here!

*\[Sprints\]*

*[→Signal Switches]*

**Citizen A**<br>
She... She ran away...

**Citizen B**<br>
The alert may have ended, but we still must stay on guard. Don't know where those things disappeared to...

**Citizen A**<br>
Wreaking havoc all of a sudden, then they all disappear. Now, everything's stopped working...

**Citizen B**<br>
Is this the end of the world...?

**Citizen A**<br>
... What are you talking about? We're still alive... We'll get through this, even if we don't have any Architects.

*[→Signal Switches]*

*\[Sprints\]*

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
Can't... Can't see.<br>
But my positioning system and sonar are still operational. I just need to get there...

*[→Signal Switches]*

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
Shelter 03... The place where I was made. Also the place I ought to be returned to when I'm destroyed.

*\[Footsteps\]*

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
......!<br>
How could... What a huge number of Architect tags... Did everybody... come here? They all... were destroyed... Could it have been...

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
Those people said... all the Architects disappeared...

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
It must... be here. The Architect's grave...

*\[Sits Down\]*

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
Rin... Soon... I'll see you...

*\[System shuts down\]*

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
