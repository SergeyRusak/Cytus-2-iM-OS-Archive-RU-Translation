**Leo**<br>
Sagar, from the Exploration Team? What may I help you with?

**Sagar**<br>
I want the command to experiment on the artifact revoked. It is inhumane.

**Leo**<br>
Inhumane? Hehe, sorry. I thought that "inhumane" could only refer to humans. That is a robot.

**Sagar**<br>
She can feel pain!

**Leo**<br>
Haha, you're no less foolish than your father.

**Sagar**<br>
What'd you say!?

**Leo**<br>
Forgive me. I do not wish to argue with you. I've already seen the data from the experiment. We will stop.

**Sagar**<br>
Huh?

**Leo**<br>
I can't reveal too much, but this Architect that you've discovered... Its identity is quite unique. We can't acquire any information inside its brain. A forced breakthrough will only transform it into a piece of scrap metal. We don't want to see that.

**Sagar**<br>
......

**Leo**<br>
Therefore... your arrival is at just the right time. We have an idea.

**Sagar**<br>
What's that?

**Leo**<br>
Although our current technology doesn't allow us to get what we want from this artifact, it is still the property of A.R.C. Besides several parts that can't be fixed, it's essentially functioning perfectly, and can communicate with us.

**Leo**<br>
This type of model was an Architect responsible for data processing and analysis prior to the Decomission. For that reason, we want to assign her to the Logistics Unit of the Exploration Squad to help out as we further observe and research her.

**Sagar**<br>
......

**Leo**<br>
Relax, I understand how you feel. We won't perform anymore invasive experiments on her. We will use other methods to collect data. And you'll see her as just another co\-worker. Not bad, right?

**Sagar**<br>
... If that's the case...

**Leo**<br>
Of course, she can't be moving about in the facilities as an Architect. That would cause quite an uproar. We'll give her the identity of a human.

**Sagar**<br>
......!? You can do that...?

**Leo**<br>
Architects originally had the ability to simulate human facial features and wrinkles on the skin. After a few modifications and some maintenance, we'll be able to do it. Not to mention that this Architect is... extremely special. I'm sure that no one will notice. This will be our little secret.

**Sagar**<br>
......

*[â†’Signal Switches]*

**Sagar**<br>
How'd it go? Everything smooth?

**A.R.C. Employee A**<br>
We're nearly finished with the maintenance, but her visual system has suffered way too much damage. There's no way we can completely fix it. However, it shouldn't affect her work.

**A.R.C. Employee B**<br>
Take these.

**Sagar**<br>
... Glasses.

**A.R.C. Employee B**<br>
Line up the frame with the port near its ear. This will rectify its eyesight, that is if you're willing.

**A.R.C. Employee A**<br>
Alright, sign here. Procedure's complete. It's now the property of the Exploration Team.

**Sagar**<br>
......<br>
Oh yeah, sorry. I was a little rough with you guys a few days ago. Thanks for fixing her up.

**A.R.C. Employee B**<br>
... It's just work. Don't worry about it. From now on, she's not under our control.

**A.R.C. Employee A**<br>
Hey, you can come out now.

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
......

**Sagar**<br>
......!

**Sagar**<br>
Exactly like a person... Her exterior, it's...?

**A.R.C. Employee A**<br>
Should be randomly produced... Could also be pieced together from people's faces in her memory. After all, she has a record of working in human society; but we weren't able to access her memory, so we can't be sure.<br>
Alright, we're going to head out.

*\[Door Closes\]*

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
Do I look... strange?

**Sagar**<br>
... What can I say? Can't tell you're a robot at all...

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
......

**Sagar**<br>
Ah, I didn't mean anything by that! It's not weird! From a human perspective, you look beautiful!

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
Beautiful...?

**Sagar**<br>
Ah! Eh... That's not what I meant...<br>
Uh, how do I say...? Ah, yes! Can you see clearly?

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
Um... It's pretty fuzzy.

**Sagar**<br>
That... They wanted me to give you these glasses. Put 'em on.

*\[Device Connects\]*

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
.......! It's so clear... So that's what you look like. Um, thanks for helping me this whole time...

**Sagar**<br>
Ah... don't worry about it. Come with me. I'll take you to the Analysis Room... Rin?

**Rin**<br>
......!

**Sagar**<br>
I'll just call you that from now on, okay? After all, you're going to assume the identity of a human when you're working here.

**Rin**<br>
... Okay.
