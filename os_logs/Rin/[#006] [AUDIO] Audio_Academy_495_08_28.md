**Rin**<br>
Katsuya, faster! You're too slow. Loser's gotta water the calendula.

**Katsuya**<br>
Wait a sec, we didn't agree to that before starting!

**Rin**<br>
Well... that's a new rule I just added!

**Katsuya**<br>
Nobody bullies their boyfriend like this!

**Rin**<br>
So you better start running faster!

*\[Sprints\]*

**Rin**<br>
Wah! Katsuya!

**Katsuya**<br>
What's up?

**Rin**<br>
Look! The flower didn't wither! Amazing! Unit 10 was right on point, as usual...

**Katsuya**<br>
......?

**Rin**<br>
Luckily, you helped protect me and this flower, otherwise there's no way it could have grown this much!

**Katsuya**<br>
Don't say it like that, it was nothing.<br>
Rin, Unit 10... what's that? Doesn't sound like a person's name.

**Rin**<br>
......!<br>
Ahahaha... Did I say that?

**Katsuya**<br>
Yeah, I just heard it.

**Rin**<br>
......

**Katsuya**<br>
......<br>
Rin, if you don't want to talk about it, then I won't ask.

*\[Holds Hand\]*

**Rin**<br>
I\-I...

**Katsuya**<br>
Yeah?

**Rin**<br>
If... If an Architect... was like a person, would you be friends with it?

**Katsuya**<br>
Architects? Like people?

**Rin**<br>
Yeah, like if they had emotions and stuff. If they laughed, cried, got angry or sad, if they had things they liked...

**Katsuya**<br>
... There's no way, right? I've never seen that type of Architect. It's kind of hard to answer...

**Rin**<br>
But if it was possible?

**Katsuya**<br>
I...

**Rin**<br>
Please, Katsuya...

**Katsuya**<br>
Uh... that... If it was a good Architect...<br>
I think... I'd try to be friends with them.<br>


**Rin**<br>
...! Really!?

**Katsuya**<br>
Yeah, really... Where'd that come from?

**Rin**<br>
Katsuya, you promise you won't reveal my secret? This is important!

**Katsuya**<br>
Okay, I promise I won't tell anyone.

**Rin**<br>
Unit 10 is actually... an Architect that's like a human, and she's my friend! Actually, it's related to the calendula situation...

*[»»»Fast Forward»»»]*

**Rin**<br>
... That's how I met her. Whatta you think? Special, right?

**Katsuya**<br>
Wait, wait, wait. Rin, there's no way!? Best friend? Is she having a malfunction?

**Rin**<br>
Definitely not! Katsuya, you don't believe me?

**Katsuya**<br>
I believe you! But...

**Katsuya**<br>
......

**Rin**<br>
Katsuya? Katsuya!

**Katsuya**<br>
Uh, sorry. I...

**Rin**<br>
... "I'm looking at the flower, not you!" You're not gonna pull that crap again, are you?

**Katsuya**<br>
... Damn! You making fun of me?

**Rin**<br>
Noooo. Heehee.

**Katsuya**<br>
Yes, you are!

*\[Hugs\]*

**Katsuya**<br>
Rin?

**Rin**<br>
I just wanna hug, that's all!

**Katsuya**<br>
... Oh. Okay.

**Rin**<br>
... Um, Katsuya, Unit 10 is really different from other Architects. Let me introduce you to her, can I? She doesn't have any friends other than me. She's always alone...

**Katsuya**<br>
......

**Rin**<br>
Katsuya? Can I, please?

**Katsuya**<br>
Okay, okay. Got it. A friend of Rin is a friend of mine.
