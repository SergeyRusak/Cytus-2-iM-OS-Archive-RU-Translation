... It's already 8 o'clock... It's been way too long

*\[Object Shatters\]*

**Rin**<br>
Wah! Who's there? 

**???**<br>
Ah... !

*\[Footsteps \]*

**Rin**<br>
You're... that Architect... Unit 10? 

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
... Hello Ms. Yazawa.<br>
Architect No. OPCII\_0584\_X, at your command. 

**Rin**<br>
Command? No, I didn't want you to... What are you doing?

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
I...

**Rin**<br>
Is this... ?

**Rin**<br>
One of Dad's research plants... ?

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
... I... was distracted when taking care of them... I am truly sorry!

**Rin**<br>
Distracted? Weird, this is the first time I've seen an Architect like this... Other Architects only follow orders.

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
No... that's not true...

**Rin**<br>
I knew it! You're different from other Architects I've met. You talk like a normal person, you hesitate, and you're even a bit afraid of me... Do you know what fear is?

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
If you are referring to its definition... It means feeling terrified and disturbed...

**Rin**<br>
No, no, that's not what I meant.<br>
My god, this is a huge discovery! I have to tell dad immediately...

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
... Wait, please don't!

*\[Objects Crashing\]*

**Rin**<br>
Wah! What's wrong?

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
I\-I don't know what's going on with me, but... if anyone finds out about this, the system will determine that I am an error... Then I will be destroyed...

**Rin**<br>
Destroyed?

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
Pl\-please lower your voice! Ms. Yazawa!

**Rin**<br>
Oh, sorry... Is that true?

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
Yes... probably...<br>
I've been in this research institute for many years! I love this job, and I respect Dr. Yazawa... If it's possible... please keep my secret for me, please! 

**Rin**<br>
Um...

**Asa**<br>
Eh? What are you doing here?

*\[Footsteps \]*

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
......!

**Rin**<br>
Ah, Mom! You guys are done? Did it go well?

**Asa**<br>
Not bad, today's data was pretty good... What's wrong? Aren't these the samples from the phase 2 plan? Why are they broken?

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
... Uh...

**Rin**<br>
......<br>
Mom, it was an accident... sorry.

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
!?

**Asa**<br>
You did this? Why did you touch these plants?

**Rin**<br>
That, I thought this kind of flower was pretty. I thought after you're done with the experiment, I could use it to decorate my room... This Architect just happened to pass by!

**Asa**<br>
... You should've asked in advance. That calendula has been injected with excessive endocrine and will wither away in 2 days, There's no point in bringing it back.   

**Rin**<br>
Oh, got it... Ahahaha.

**Asa**<br>
If you want, I can buy you another one. Thankfully these samples' data have already been collected...<br>
Architect, get rid of these things. 

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
... Command received, executing immediately.

**Asa**<br>
Rin, I can buy you the plant you want. As for the loss you cost the institute, it will be deducted from your allowance. Any problem with that?  

**Rin**<br>
... Oh... okay.

**Asa**<br>
...*\*sigh\**...

*\[Footsteps\]*

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
... I am really sorry Ms. Yazawa, you took the blame for me...

**Rin**<br>
It's alright, you won't be destroyed right? Don't sweat it, I'll keep the secret for you, no one will find out!  

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
Re\-Really?

**Rin**<br>
Of course! But there's one condition.

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
Condition... ?

**Rin**<br>
Heehee... From now on, you'll have to call me by my name.

**OPCII_0584_X**<br>
... Um, got it...<br>
Thank you... Rin.
