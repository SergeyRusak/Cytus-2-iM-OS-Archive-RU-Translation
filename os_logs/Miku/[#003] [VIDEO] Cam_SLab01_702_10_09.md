**[Staff A]**<br>
*Miku, great work!*

**Miku**<br>
Whew~... Everyone is very happy. I'm relieved~

**[Staff A]**<br>
*Of course they're happy. Your performance was great!*

**Miku**<br>
I was really worried about not singing well. <br>
Especially that one song NEKO arranged!

**[Staff A]**<br>
*That song is indeed quite hard to sing... but Miku will never make a mistake. No need to worry.*

**Miku**<br>
Practice does make perfect after all. I need to practice even harder!

**[Staff A]**<br>
*Haha, you can get some rest and call it a day today. You must be tired after the event, right?*

**Miku**<br>
I'm not tired at all. To be honest, I feel very energetic now!

**[Staff A]**<br>
*(Cheers! Hahaha!)*

**Miku**<br>
By the way, where are Mr. Abe and the others at now? A celebration party? Feels really lively.

**[Staff A]**<br>
*Ah... yeah.*

**Miku**<br>
Aw, man~ I want to go as well. Why is it that after every event ends, I can only return to my room?

**[Staff A]**<br>
*Haha, next time. We'll definitely let you participate next time, okay? Just get some proper rest today. I've prepared your favorite food in your room. If you need anything, call me.*

**Miku**<br>
Okay. Thanks for the hard work~
