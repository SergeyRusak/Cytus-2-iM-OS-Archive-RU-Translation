The company just refused to let you take the stage no matter what. This is the only method left.

**Miku**<br>
It's too late! The performance is going to start anytime now. I also have no idea what the content of the performance is...

**Furuhata**<br>
If it's the song list, I installed it in you just now. As with how to sing... you're a singer, right? The program I wrote won't make a mistake here.
