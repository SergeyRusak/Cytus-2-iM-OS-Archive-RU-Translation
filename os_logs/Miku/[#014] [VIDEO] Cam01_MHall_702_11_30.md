**Miku**<br>
I... What am I singing for?

**Miku**<br>
Ah, I see. I'm singing for everyone.

*[»»» Fast Forward »»»]*

**Miku**<br>
That was the last song.

**Miku**<br>
Today... No, not just today. Thank you to everyone for your support all this time.

**Miku**<br>
When I sing on the stage for everyone, I can see everyone's happiness. That's why I can keep on singing.

**Miku**<br>
I'm truly... truly grateful for everyone...

**Miku**<br>
Last but not least, I want to give everyone one more song. Everyone, are you willing to sing along with me?

**Miku**<br>
It's over... At the very end, I am still singing for everyone. That's all I asked for.

**Miku**<br>
Thank you. Everyone, thank you so much.

**Miku**<br>
Thank... you.
