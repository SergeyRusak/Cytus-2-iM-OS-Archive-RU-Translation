*\*Sobs\*... \*Sobs\*...*

**???**<br>
... Who is there?

**Miku**<br>
Eh!?

*\[Footsteps\]*

**???**<br>
......? Fragments of a program...? How did this end up here...

**Miku**<br>
H....... Heelp meeeee! Geett me oooouuutttt of here! Please!

**???**<br>
... An A.I.'s virtual personality? What is going on?

**Miku**<br>
I beg you! IIII must go bbbbaackk as soon as possible... go back to eeeevvvveryone!

**???**<br>
... You're merely a piece of broken code. There isn't much I can help you with.

**Miku**<br>
W...... wwwwhhhhaaat are you talking about...?

**???**<br>
Are you not self\-aware of this? Look at these; they're probably versions before you. They appear to be A.I. produced with the cyTus technology. Maybe it's because of the previous internet malfunction that caused damaged data to be stuck inside this "space".

**???**<br>
From the looks of it, you've likely been deleted and scrapped from the host unit. I'm not certain why you're the only one that is still able to function.

**Miku**<br>
I... dddon't understandddd... what you're sayingggg... at all... What eeeexxactly is this place?

**???**<br>
This... is where all the "chaos" in the virtual internet gathers. I don't know how this space was created. Ever since I got the ability to enter this space, the only thing I understand is that it has already existed for a very long time, like a digital black hole.

**Miku**<br>
......

**???**<br>
I called it the "OS"... However, giving it a name is rather meaningless anyway. In reality, you're the first to ever have a conversation with me in here.

**Miku**<br>
Hey... Please, I hhhhave to leave here. Ppppplease hhhhelp me!

**???**<br>
I said before; there isn't much I can help you with. You're nothing more than a piece of broken virtual personality code. These past versions of you which you replaced are hard evidence of that. <br>
Staying here or leaving here doesn't matter; it's all meaningless. Judging by the condition of the program, it won't take long before you begin formatting on your own.

**Miku**<br>
Virtual personalityyyy... formatting... How come...?

**???**<br>
... Time is up. I have to go now.

**Miku**<br>
W... Please wait!

**Miku**<br>

**Miku**<br>
*\*Sobs\*...*

**???**<br>
You're still here.

**Miku**<br>
I want... to go bbbbaaack... go back and sing for everyone... I want to see eeevvveryone's smile...

**???**<br>
......<br>
Hatsune Miku, right? The virtual idol of "Saito Production". I did a little bit of research.

**Miku**<br>
......Eh?

**???**<br>
It seems like you still aren't able to accept this situation. Not important. The method to let you leave here, I found it.

**Miku**<br>
FFFor real!?

**???**<br>
Yes. As expected, it was the impact from the surge that caused you to be stuck here. Since that's the case, I simply need to adjust to an opposite wavelength and I should be able to locate the port you came in from. I know the connection coordinates of the company too. We're both in Node 03. I can upload you back to your original host unit.

**Miku**<br>
... DDDDDon't rrreally understand... But, pleasseee! I have to go back!

**???**<br>
... Although this is none of my business, I'll still give you a piece of advice. You seem to believe that you can still function normally after going back... No, I should say live your previous life after going back.

**Miku**<br>
......?

**???**<br>
I said before that all of you are scrapped versions. This means that there's perhaps an even more cruel truth awaiting you after you go back. Even so, do you still want to go back?

**Miku**<br>
O, of course! Please!

**???**<br>
... Then get yourself ready.<br>
... Wave frequency captured. The upload will begin in a few minutes.

**Miku**<br>
Okay! Thank you soooo much! I, I... don't really have anything to repay you... Tickets for my cccconcert?

**???**<br>
I don't need it.

**Miku**<br>
All in all, thank you so much... But, why aaare you willing to help me allll of a sssuuuuddenn...?

**???**<br>
Why, is it...? "Scrapped"... "A.I."... I can't just ignore this after all...

**Miku**<br>
Eh...?

**???**<br>
Nothing. If I have to see you every time I come in here before you formatted on your own, I'd be quite troubled. That's all there is to it.<br>
Prepare yourself. The upload will begin soon.

**Miku**<br>
Yes! ... Ah! Name! I haven't assskkked what your name is?

**???**<br>
It doesn't matter. We will not see each other ever again.

**Miku**<br>
