**Staff A**<br>
Director, so this is where you are!

**Furuhata**<br>
......<br>
You've finished the "Raising Procedure"?

**Staff A**<br>
Yes, it went by without any issues. But shouldn't Director be personally handling jobs like this? You're the very person who created Miku after all.

**Furuhata**<br>
... I'm not interested in raising idols.

**Staff A**<br>
How come? You created an idol who's borderline perfect, didn't you?<br>
Miku's personality has become more and more humanlike. It's like she's a real girl... no, like a real superstar!

**Furuhata**<br>
... This is the core of this technology. Through a virtual interface and stimulations from the outside world, we let the program have an awareness that it "actually exists" in order to improve the sense of realism in virtual personalities. 

**Staff A**<br>
Amazing... Truly, amazing! Director, you're an absolute genius!<br>
Ah, but just now, Miku made a slight complaint about not being able to participate in the celebration party. This has never happened before... Will this conversation affect her in any way?

**Furuhata**<br>
Oh, if another cognitive conflict occurs, just reset and update her.

**Staff A**<br>
But...

**Furuhata**<br>
Okay, okay, I get it... I'll upgrade the interactive UI afterward, which will let her interact with you guys in the real world. Happy now?<br>
Alright. I'm just going to grab a few drinks myself then get out of here. You can leave now.

**Staff B**<br>
Ah, it's the director and Mr. Abe. Why don't you guys join us?

**Furuhata**<br>
Tch...

**Staff B**<br>
Such a high\-class restaurant, and there's even wine ... Never imagined that mere employees like us would get invited as well.

**Staff C**<br>
Probably due to the project's amazing results and the higher\-ups being very pleased with them.<br>
Right now, we're already the most favored team in the entire company.

**Staff B**<br>
Haha, the turnout for the concert far exceeded our estimations. Not only did we sell out all the tickets, but the revenue from merchandise sales was also astounding! <br>
No other talent agency in 03 can even dream of catching up to us!

**Staff C**<br>
The statistics on my side also showed that the approval ratings curve of the fans is very steady. They truly fell in love with Miku as an idol... They're able to get their hopes and dreams from Miku.

**Staff A**<br>
This is all thanks to director Furuhata! We'd never be able to do this on our own. A toast to the director!

**Furuhata**<br>
No need.

**Staff A**<br>
Umm...

**Furuhata**<br>
I don't like people being next to me when I drink. Leave me alone.

**Staff C**<br>
I, I'm so sorry! Apologies for bothering you. We'll leave right away!

*\[Footsteps\]*

**Staff B**<br>
Idiot. You picked the worst guy to flatter! Director has made it very clear what kind of person he is...

**Staff A**<br>
I, I'm sorry!

**Furuhata**<br>
... Hmph.

**Saito**<br>
Still as cold as always, aren't you? Furuhata.

*\[Footsteps\]*

**Furuhata**<br>
Saito.

**Saito**<br>
The previous performance, have you seen the live recording?

**Furuhata**<br>
I saw it.

**Saito**<br>
Her movement is getting more and more precise. The performance of the voice print algorithms is also right on point. Not to mention the A.I.'s level of completion... It's as if she's an actual living person. You did very well.

**Furuhata**<br>
I merely followed your proposal. It wasn't anything noteworthy.

**Saito**<br>
You're selling yourself short. Even though I'm the founder of the virtual idol project, what I did was nothing more than figure out this project's branding after seeing the internet image of that DJ... This project was able to be actually realized because you're the one at the helm. You're very much Miku's father. 

**Furuhata**<br>
... I don't have any children, nor do I plan to be Miku's father or anything close to it.

**Saito**<br>
Ha, haha... Regardless, the project was a great success. That alone is already worthy of celebration. Don't you agree,<br>
lead developer? Cheers?

**Furuhata**<br>
......

*\[Cheers\]*

**Saito**<br>
Trust my eyes! Miku has the potential to be popular worldwide. She simply needs to keep singing for at least ten more years... We're all counting on you! We'll give you all the support you need. If you need anything, feel free to ask.

**Furuhata**<br>
I think I'm good. Just don't interfere with my work. As long as I am fully in charge of the development, you won't have to worry about a thing.

**Saito**<br>
Hoho, how trustworthy. The evaluation period is right around the corner. You can look forward to a pay raise!

**Furuhata**<br>
I'll be waiting.
