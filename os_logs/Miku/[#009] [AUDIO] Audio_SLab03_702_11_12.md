**Miku**<br>
Hey, can I ask you something?

**Furuhata**<br>
... I understand that I set your curiosity to a high level, but my god do you have a lot of questions...

**Miku**<br>
It has been several days already. When can I return to the stage and sing?

**Furuhata**<br>
... Never.

**Miku**<br>
......! What! Didn't you say that you're deleting me? And you won't let me go back to sing. All you did was place me in this projection device, and kept turning it on and off while shrinking and enlarging me! What do you want! Hmph!

**Furuhata**<br>
You seem to already accept the fact that you're not a real human? You sure learn fast.

**Miku**<br>
......<br>
With this situation... anyone can understand by just looking at it.

**Furuhata**<br>
Despite that, you still want to go back and sing?

**Miku**<br>
Yes. I understand that I'm not a real person. Nevertheless, I know that the happiness and emotions I brought to everyone with my music and singing are indeed real...

**Furuhata**<br>
Ho? With that noisy music of yours?

**Miku**<br>
My music is not noisy~ I bet you've never properly listened to any of my songs, right?

**Furuhata**<br>
No, and I'm not interested. Alright, now be quiet and let me work.

**Miku**<br>
You suck... So much for you being my creator. Let me go back to the stage!

**Furuhata**<br>
Sigh... Listen up. Right now, everyone's favorite Hatsune Miku is singing and dancing on stage. It's just not you, but no one will ever notice the difference. Therefore, if it's about making the audience happy, there's no need for you to worry since 2.4 is doing that very well.

**Miku**<br>
Uhhh...

**Furuhata**<br>
Hatsune Miku herself has to think that she is a real idol and devote herself to everyone for the audience to also be devoted to her, so don't be too self\-conscious about it.<br>
Right now, you're not in a condition to sing properly on stage. Not even close. It's best to let the latest version take over.

**Miku**<br>
... If that's the case, why did you still keep me around... If I can't sing for everyone, I'd rather...

**Furuhata**<br>
I don't know why, but I couldn't actively delete you. However, with how damaged you are, all I need to do is leave you alone and you'll eventually format on your own due to the mechanics. That's what I originally planned to do.

**Miku**<br>
... But you fixed me, didn't you? Why?

**Furuhata**<br>
No, I didn't fix you. Strictly speaking, I merely extended your stability. It's because I discovered that, surprisingly, you have very high compatibility with this interactive projection UI. I'm hesitant to test this with the latest version, so I decided to put you in.

**Miku**<br>
So you kept me around just so you can test this thing...? Unbelievable... Cold\-blooded! Monster! Baldy!

**Furuhata**<br>
... Whatever you say. Your personality was written by me anyway. 

**Miku**<br>
Muuuu~!

**Miku**<br>
Hey, is the testing not done yet?

**Furuhata**<br>
Trust me. If I'm done with the testing, I would've muted you a long time ago.

**Miku**<br>
You're still mad... Okay, umm... I shouldn't have said that to you yesterday. I am reflecting on that misstep... sorry.

**Furuhata**<br>
......

**Miku**<br>
Speaking of which, why is everyone gone? Why are you staying behind and doing this all by yourself? Must be tough.

**Furuhata**<br>
This is a project I started myself. If I succeed, I might get a higher bonus. Nothing else to it.

**Miku**<br>
......<br>
Mr. Furuhata, why are you doing this job? You always seem so unhappy. It appears that people around you are too scared to approach you as well.

**Furuhata**<br>
......

**Miku**<br>
Must be for your family, right? I heard before that you have a wife. Isn't that amazing? Working hard for someone important to you, that should be something joyful. Do you two have children?

**Furuhata**<br>
... If my child is as annoying as you are, then I am very fortunate to not have one.

**Miku**<br>
Muuuu~!<br>
Ah, right! This... Is this a photo of your wife? Such a beautiful person~ What's her name?<br>
Ah! The one next to her is your child, right?

**Furuhata**<br>
......! You... Where did you get this photo?

**Miku**<br>
Eh? Umm, I was bored just now, so I went through the storage block on the desktop...

**Furuhata**<br>
...... PUT IT BACK! Don't touch the files in the host unit!

**Miku**<br>
Eek!? I'm sorry... Since you left it on the desktop, I thought it was something I could view during the test... I just want to know more about you...

**Furuhata**<br>
So damn annoying... Why do I have to write such an irritating personality, this girl idol nonsense... Listen closely. If you think getting in my good graces will persuade me to let you back on the stage, forget about it. That'll never happen. 

**Miku**<br>
W, what! I saw you working overtime every day and that nobody is around to talk with you. That's why I wanted to find some conversation topics...<br>
If you don't want the files to be seen, put them somewhere secure!

**Furuhata**<br>
You little brat...! I don't need your sympathy! You mess something up again and I'll turn you off!

**Miku**<br>
Oh, then go ahead! Turn me off! I can't sing anyway, so what's the point of me being here! I hate you too! If you hate it so much, why don't you just leave here? You don't like Miku at all, and you don't like what you're doing now! Putting up a long face all day, no wonder people hate y...

*\[Close Program\]*

**Furuhata**<br>
......<br>
... Sigh... What in the world am I doing?
