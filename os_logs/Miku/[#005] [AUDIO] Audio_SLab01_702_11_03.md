*... A while ago, due to an equipment error in Node 08's A.R.C. facility, the virtual internet cyTus was significantly damaged and went out of service temporarily. Many companies that suffered losses due to their use of virtual internet technology are also starting to file cases against A.R.C. and requesting compensation...*

**Staff A**<br>
Ughhh, we're also among the ones affected...

**Staff B**<br>
We took a pretty big hit this time, didn't we? Miku couldn't operate at all and we had to cancel multiple events... Sighhhh\~ my year\-end bonus...

**Staff C**<br>
Welp, can't really complain about a long holiday though, can we? It's paid leave too.

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Furuhata**<br>
Hey, shouldn't you guys be working?

**Staff A**<br>
Ah! Director! Good Morning!

**Furuhata**<br>
You're too loud... I know a long holiday just ended but keep your damn voice down.

**Staff B**<br>
Are we doing the routine checkup?

**Furuhata**<br>
No need for that. Just begin the Raising Procedure right away. My guess is that this version will likely be scrapped soon.

**Staff C**<br>
Ehhh!? Ah...

**Furuhata**<br>
With such a major malfunction to cyTus, the sudden surge will directly damage all operating files... Did you brains not come back from the vacation yet?

**Staff B**<br>
... Is it really that bad this time?

**Furuhata**<br>
Well, we'll know once you launch it. Don't get your hopes up though.

*\[Launch Program\]*

**Staff A**<br>
... Miku, good morning.

**Miku**<br>
Ggggooood mmornninggg, Mrrr. Abbbeee...

**Staff A**<br>
Yikes... Are you alright?

**Miku**<br>
Ggggooood mmornninggg, Mrrr. Abbbeee...

**Staff A**<br>
Director! What should we do!? We've never seen a situation like this!

**Miku**<br>
Ggggooood mmornninggg, Mrrr. Abbbeee...

**Furuhata**<br>
Why are you so surprised... she's broken, obviously. Turn her off. This version is not usable anymore.

**Miku**<br>
Ggggooood mmornninggg, Mrr. Abe...

*\[Close Program\]*

**Staff A**<br>
Eh? That's it...?

**Furuhata**<br>
It's about time we update to 2.4 too. I've written some new functions, and the interactive UI I mentioned last time is set to go live as well. How's the schedule of the Q.A. department looking?

**Staff B**<br>
Director, if we are to assess from this report, if we start working hard on it now, we should be able to make it in time for the next concert.

**Staff A**<br>
Uhhh, so this means more overtime...

**Staff C**<br>
Hey, this is for the many fans of Miku. Get yourself together.

**Furuhata**<br>
... Then we'll go with this plan. Any other questions?

**Staff A**<br>
Director, about the backup data for Miku\_2.3.9...

**Furuhata**<br>
Just ignore that version.

**Staff A**<br>
Eh?

**Furuhata**<br>
That backup is way too fragmented. Most of the data was likely swept into some random corner of cyTus when the surge occurred. Rather than waste time finding and fixing this stuff, we'd be much better off to just treat it like a bug and proceed with the regular process.

**Staff A**<br>
Ah, I see...

**Staff C**<br>
Let's use the old data to simply remake the new version! Director, I say we use a new patch number? We need to add in a more dramatic and infectious movement model for the stage anyway...

**Furuhata**<br>
Whatever, I don't really mind  ... as long as you don't accidentally mess with my codes.

**Staff C**<br>
Rest assured! I won't! The objective is to officially launch Miku\_2.4 at the next concert. Not a lot of time left, so let's get working!

**Staff A„ÄÅB**<br>
Yes!

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Furuhata**<br>
Ah, right... remember to clean out all the useless data and versions from the database. That stuff will cause the A.I.'s internal operations to experience lag.

**Staff A**<br>
No problem. I will deal with it in a minute.
