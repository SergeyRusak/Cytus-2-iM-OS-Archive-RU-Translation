**Okubo**<br>
Furuhata, have you gone insane? This is absurd!

**Saito**<br>
Okubo, calm down first. The things Furuhata are responsible for in our company is something only he is qualified to do. He won't just spill out random things. Right, Furuhata? 

**Furuhata**<br>
Although the 2.3.9 backup is not a complete version, her performance function is definitely not affected. 

**Okubo**<br>
What the hell are you talking about? Weren't you the one who determined it to be too badly damaged in the first place!?

**Kitamura**<br>
I've asked a few of your subordinates in the R&D department. Regarding this case, they all said that they can't guarantee anything.

**Furuhata**<br>
I am the developer of Miku. I have the final say in this.

**Saito**<br>
If we are to use some common sense, since we already have the latest and guaranteed error\-free version 2.4, I really don't see the argument for not using it. This newer version is superior in all aspects, isn't it?

**Okubo**<br>
If we use a risky version and cause the audience to have an unpleasant experience, what are you going to do? This is not the stuff YOU PROGRAMMERS encounter that can be resolved by hitting a few keys. This stuff will actually impact the overall image of the company.

**Saito**<br>
We absolutely respect your role in this project, be it your maintenance of Miku or you pretty much being Miku's father. However, from the company's perspective, they're also some things we must consider as well.

**Furuhata**<br>
......

**Kitamura**<br>
As the lead developer of the company, you're not allowed to let your personal preferences overshadow your professional judgment. Furuhata, I believe you agree with that, right?

**Furuhata**<br>
......

**Saito**<br>
Can you let us know the reasoning behind such a decision?

**Kitamura**<br>
No, I don't think there's any point in asking. Replacing the version at such a crucial moment is already borderline impossible. Not to mention it's a switch to an older, less stable version...

**Okubo**<br>
Saito, I feel like you've been defending Furuhata way too much. Based on my way of thinking, this meeting is utterly pointless and a complete waste of time!

*\[Pushes desk and chairs\]*

**Saito**<br>
......

**Kitamura**<br>
......

**Furuhata**<br>
... I have no way of rebutting your doubts. If I'm to say anything, it's that I truly believe that the performance of 2.3.9 will far exceed that of 2.4.

**Okubo**<br>
Ha... hahaha... tch!<br>
Listen to yourself. Your words don't even make proper sense!

**Saito**<br>
... Alright. I understand what you mean. We'll discuss it a bit further. However, I'd also advise you to not keep your hopes up. Since I represent the company, I need to thoroughly consider all the details before making the decision.

**Furuhata**<br>
Okay.

**Saito**<br>
You should leave first.
