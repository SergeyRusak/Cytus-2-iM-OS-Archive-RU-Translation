**Miku**<br>
Wow~ This is my first time meeting everyone outside of my room and the venue. I'm so happy...

**Staff A**<br>
Nice to meet you, Miku.

**Miku**<br>
Haha, Mr. Abe, why are you so formal? We've seen each other plenty of times already.

**Staff A**<br>
Haha. This is our CEO, Mr. Saito. Then PR director Okubo, IT director Kitamura, and R&D director Furuhata.

**Miku**<br>
Greetings, everyone! Nice to meet you!

**Saito**<br>
Hoho! This is incredible! Now, we shall take you on a quick tour of the company!

**Miku**<br>
Okay! I'm looking forward to it!

**Furuhata**<br>
......

**Kitamura**<br>
Furuhata, don't forget to remove the test version from the host unit.

**Furuhata**<br>
...Yeah, I know.

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Furuhata**<br>
......

**Miku**<br>
So that's the latest version of Miku? Amazing, she is exactly like me... No, she feels even more like an idol than me...

**Furuhata**<br>
In order to remove some unnecessary elements, this version smooths out her emotion model. She won't doubt, won't be sad... and won't get angry. She only has positive emotions. This is probably closer to the "idol" image, isn't it?

**Miku**<br>
... If there's someone like her who can continue to bring everyone smiles, I guess there isn't much for me to worry about. Haha... But, in the end, I still want to sing one last time...

**Furuhata**<br>
......

**Miku**<br>
Alright then. Go ahead!

**Furuhata**<br>
......?

**Miku**<br>
You're moving me to an idle unit, right? I'm prepared.

**Furuhata**<br>
You... you gave up?

**Miku**<br>
Yes. There's nothing else I can do anyway...<br>
Ah, but before that... I guess I should apologize to you again for making you mad a few days ago. We haven't really talked after that. Even though I'm an A.I., I still feel a little bit lonely. Haha...

**Furuhata**<br>
... Yeah. It's alright.

**Miku**<br>
I didn't realize the photo was that important to you...

**Furuhata**<br>
Tsumugi.

**Miku**<br>
...Eh?

**Furuhata**<br>
My wife's name. Her name is Tsumugi. The boy next to her is Junichi. He's not our child... but he's also our child.

**Miku**<br>
Eh? Then he is now...

**Furuhata**<br>
He's dead.

**Miku**<br>
......! Did something... happen?

**Furuhata**<br>
Tsumugi used to be an excellent nurse. Because of her physical conditions, we were unable to have any children. She went through multiple miscarriages as well.

**Furuhata**<br>
After her parents passed away, she decided to give up her job at the hospital. Together, we founded a charity foundation that helped those in Node 03 who are too poor to get medical treatment, especially young children.

**Furuhata**<br>
We took care of those children like they were our own... I also used my time outside of work and developed many medical devices. We were able to help quite a few people. This was the dream that we've always been pursuing.

**Furuhata**<br>
However, when I decided to introduce the "Intelligent Caretaker" technology into underprivileged homes for free, the Administration Bureau took note of us. They noticed that our plan conflicted with their "profits". Therefore, they began to oppress the foundation in various ways.

**Furuhata**<br>
They prevented many people from getting the help they should've gotten from the foundation.<br>
Because of this, diseases took away many of our patients. Junichi was one of those patients... He was a good child.

**Miku**<br>
......

**Furuhata**<br>
At last, two years ago, we finally got to a point where we couldn't continue operating anymore. The foundation was forcibly acquired by the Administration Bureau and turned into the "Kyubo Medical Center" you see now.

**Furuhata**<br>
Afterward, because of the pressure from them, not a single company from that industry dared to hire me. In the end, I had no choice but to come here. My skills with the Intelligent Caretaker's A.I. technology allowed me to be of some use here, so I created you, Hatsune Miku.

**Furuhata**<br>
Tsumugi's body is getting weaker by the day. However, with the measly salary I get from this small company on top of the new medical system post\-acquisition, there's absolutely nothing we can do... Despite all that, Tsumugi still wants me to donate money to help others as much as possible. That's how kindhearted of a person she is... Yet someone as kind as her...

**Miku**<br>
Mr. Furuhata...

**Furuhata**<br>
Didn't you want to know more about me? This is my story. If you think that after experiencing all that, I can still somehow maintain a smile while looking at those young folks singing and dancing to a cheery young idol, then sorry, but I think you're asking a bit too much from this bitter old man.

**Miku**<br>
I didn't mean that...

**Furuhata**<br>
Nevertheless... When you yelled at me that day, it reminded me of the past again. "I hate you"... is it? That brat yelled those exact same words at me before. Who would've thought that he could successfully graduate from First Academy? Not me at least, haha... He's a fan of yours too.

**Miku**<br>
......

**Furuhata**<br>
Hey, do you want to sing?

**Miku**<br>
Eh...? I do! Of course I do!

**Furuhata**<br>
With your current program stability, you may not even finish an entire concert. Even so, do you still want to sing?

**Miku**<br>
... Yes, I want to sing! But... if the concert gets disrupted because of me, Mr. Furuhata will be...

**Furuhata**<br>
Yep, I'll be utterly screwed... However, seeing someone created by me be forced to give up on her dream like the worthless old man I am now... feels infinitely worse. 

**Miku**<br>
But...

**Furuhata**<br>
No more buts. If you want to sing, then go for it.
