*That's pretty much it. Got to make sure that the concert this month is a great success. We'll be in your care!*

**Furuhata**<br>
You don't have to call me on a weekend for such a minor adjustment like this though...

**[Saito]**<br>
*Hahaha! Sorry for bothering you... Ah! Right, there's one more thing.*

**Furuhata**<br>
What?

**[Saito]**<br>
*I heard from Kitamura that he found a save file of the old 2.3.9 in your unit. Wasn't that deleted already?*

**Furuhata**<br>
Huh? Shouldn't he be asking that question to himself...? I'm even more puzzled about this than he is.

**[Saito]**<br>
*From the sound of it, you knew about this as well? Keeping a corrupted version in your unit, not something you'd do. What's going on?*

**Furuhata**<br>
Oh, in short, for some unknown reason, I couldn't delete that version. So, I decided to fix and reuse it.

**[Saito]**<br>
*Reuse?*

**Furuhata**<br>
Yes. The interactive UI I'm developing right now is running tests using that version. Once it's completed, Miku can appear in the real world and interact with people more. Isn't this what you guys always wanted?

**[Saito]**<br>
*Ohh, right! That's great to hear! I was wondering why you've been working overtime so often these days. So this is what you've been busy with. Thanks for the hard work! I'll make sure you get your bonus! Ah, but you should still be careful, since you're testing with a broken version.*

**Furuhata**<br>
I know. After I'm done, I'll isolate it in a separate storage area to let it format itself. There won't be any negative effects.

**[Saito]**<br>
*You're concerned about the possible risk if you test with the latest version, right? Not a bad decision at all. Then I'll treat this incident as a non\-issue this time. Looking forward to your results! Haha!*

**Furuhata**<br>
... Anything else?

**[Saito]**<br>
*Oh! Nothing else! Go spend some time with your wife!*

*[Call Ends]*

**Furuhata**<br>
......

**Tsumugi**<br>
Dear, what's the matter? You look very pale. Did you get chewed out by your boss again? Cough cough...

**Furuhata**<br>
... Oh! Nothing. Was talking about my bonus. With this, we'll have the money for your return checkup next month. Thank goodness.

**Tsumugi**<br>
... That money, you should donate it to the foundation. I'll be fine.

**Furuhata**<br>
What are you talking about...? The foundation right now is no longer what it used to be. Even if we donate it to them...

**Tsumugi**<br>
Even if that's the case, they are still helping people. Just with a different approach than us... Cough cough...

**Furuhata**<br>
......

**Tsumugi**<br>
... You... you don't seem very happy these days. Don't force yourself.

**Furuhata**<br>
... I'm fine. Just a bit tired, since I've been staying up late quite a bit. Don't worry about me.

**Tsumugi**<br>
Ah, right! I received a message from Ryou yesterday. Do you still remember that kid?

**Furuhata**<br>
Of course I do! He's the mischievous brat who constantly got zeros on his quizzes.

**Tsumugi**<br>
He graduated from the Academy a while ago. Take a look.

**[Message Projection]**<br>
*Headmaster! It's me! Ryou! I haven't seen you guys in a long time!*

**Furuhata**<br>
Haha... this brat has grown so tall.

**[Message Projection]**<br>
*A while ago, I heard that you'd fallen sick. However, I was preparing for my exams, so I didn't have the time to visit you. Look! It's the graduation certificate from the First Academy! I hope that seeing this will make you feel better! Also, don't forget to show it to the old geezer! Haha.*

**Furuhata**<br>
Ha, this brat...

**Tsumugi**<br>
Still as energetic as he used to be. Still mumbles those weird terms too.

**[Message Projection]**<br>
*I plan to go to Node 02 for my job in a few days. I may not have the time to visit you. However, I've sent you my favorite album.*

**[Message Projection]**<br>
*It's my idol... does that make me kind of a nerd? Haha! Nevertheless, this is what I listen to whenever I feel down. Her singing is filled with energy, and it would be great if she could pump you up too! Ah, but don't let the geezer hear it. He hates this idol crap and might get really grumpy about it. Haha!*

**Furuhata**<br>
......!

**Tsumugi**<br>
*\*Chuckles\** Look what we have here... cough... What a coincidence.

**Furuhata**<br>
Miku's Album...?

**[Message Projection]**<br>
*That's it for now. I'll visit you two when I have the time to come back. See ya!*

**Furuhata**<br>
......

**Tsumugi**<br>
Dear, the things you are doing now, it may be secretly helping many people in a more indirect manner, in ways that you never realized are possible.

**Furuhata**<br>
......

**Tsumugi**<br>
So don't put up a long face all the time. Be more cheerful.

**Furuhata**<br>
... Okay.
