**Furuhata**<br>
...... What do you want?

**Saito**<br>
Nothing. Just checking. This is your last day at the company after all... So you're leaving for real?

**Furuhata**<br>
Didn't you sign all the papers already?

**Saito**<br>
That's certainly the case... Sigh, do things really have to end this way?

**Furuhata**<br>
Okubo is practically ecstatic to see me gone. Besides, Kitamura is still here.

**Saito**<br>
Don't mention Kitamura... I know very well that you're the most talented lead developer here. With you gone, I'm really concerned about the prospect of this project...

*\[Document Projection\]*

**Furuhata**<br>
This is one year's worth of main program update plans and maintenance procedures. Things won't go haywire as long as you follow this chart. Afterward, it'll be all up to you guys.

**Saito**<br>
So you even made such detailed plans... I never knew about this.

**Furuhata**<br>
Well, now you do.

**Saito**<br>
But, the estimation is that this project will merely be at its halfway point in one year. If Miku truly wants to take the next step towards the world, we cannot slow down the development process. If you're not around...

**Furuhata**<br>
Compare to me, or even you... Abe and the others understand the meaning Miku symbolizes even better. After they take over, they'll do a better job than I ever did, eventually.

**Saito**<br>
The meaning Miku symbolizes... That's so unlike something you would say.

**Furuhata**<br>
... Can't say you're wrong on that.<br>
All in all, my mission here is already finished.

**Saito**<br>
Then... what are you going to do afterward? I know this job may seem meaningless to you...

**Furuhata**<br>
Meaningless, eh...? Now there is a meaning, which is why I'm leaving.

**Saito**<br>
But you've had troubles with the admins, right? It may be tough for you to find another job...

**Furuhata**<br>
Find a job? No, I'm not going to be just finding a "job" anymore.

**Saito**<br>
What do you mean?

**Furuhata**<br>
Nothing.<br>
I'm going to continue packing my things. Saito, thanks a lot for these past two years.

**Saito**<br>
Sigh, alright... Say hi to your wife for me.

**Furuhata**<br>
Sure.

**Furuhata**<br>
That should be everything... Oww, my back...

**Furuhata**<br>
System, report data organization progress.

**[Operating System]**<br>
*Data organization completed. 1 sound file discovered. Security inspection: Green.*

**Furuhata**<br>
...? What is this?<br>
That bastard Kitamura, he didn't mess with my unit, did he? 

**Furuhata**<br>
System, play file.

**[Operating System]**<br>
*File is encrypted. Please enter the command code.*

**Furuhata**<br>
And it's encrypted too? Just what the heck is this thing...
