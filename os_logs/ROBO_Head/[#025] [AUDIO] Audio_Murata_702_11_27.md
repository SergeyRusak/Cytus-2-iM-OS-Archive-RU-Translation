*\[Repairing\]*

**Ichiro**<br>
As expected, some places are short\-circuited... Alright, that's pretty much it.<br>
Try and move around!

*\[ROBO_Head waves\]*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Joint synchronization rate increase by 105%.*

**Ichiro**<br>
Nice!

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Ichiro, amazing. Thank you.*

**Ichiro**<br>
Hehe, I learned a few things working under Chief for so many years. You can also use this trick on new equipment...

*\[Metal Footsteps\]*

**Ichiro**<br>
Hey, where are you going?

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Repair of parts, complete.<br>
This unit, going back to see Nora.*

**Ichiro**<br>
I told you it's not the time yet! The news of your arrival in Node 03 has already been spread to every corner of the organization. Right now, you're a wanted criminal on the admins' list!

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*......<br>
Must go back soon to help Nora. Ichiro, any ideas?*

**Ichiro**<br>
... I contacted Daigo about this. Ever since you came back, Nora has buried herself further into work. She is simply not willing to see anybody.

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*......*

**Ichiro**<br>
Help Nora... so basically getting her out of Kyuu Hou Kai? Do you realize that this means going against the entire Node 03 organization and its cooperations? It's not a simple task. On top of that, her willingness to be taken out is also a problem.

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Affirmative. Concerns, reasonable.*

**Ichiro**<br>
At least wait a while longer, okay? We need to plan this thing more carefully. At the very least, we need to wait until you're not the talk of the town before we can take action.

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*......*

**Ichiro**<br>
Rest assured. At least your current whereabouts haven't been exposed yet.<br>
The organization won't bother to look into a nobody like me. They probably didn't expect you to hide here either.

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Understood. Ichiro, is a nobody. Very reliable.*

**Ichiro**<br>
I don't know if that's a compliment or an insult...<br>
I need to go buy some things. Please look after my home. Grandma still has some trouble walking. If possible, give her a hand too, see what she needs.

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Understood. People Nora helps, this unit will help as well.*
