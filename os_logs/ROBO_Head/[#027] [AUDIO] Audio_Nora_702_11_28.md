*Nora……？*

**[Nora]**<br>
*......<br>
It's fixed. Daigo, I'll let you handle the rest.*

**Member D**<br>
Can you hear me?

*This unit, start\-up, success. Running self\-diagnostics... complete.<br>
System functions, normal.*

**Member D**<br>
Don't understand why she still decided to fix you? She could've just left you alone and ignored you...

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*... Where's Ichiro?*

**Member D**<br>
No need to worry. They are currently in a very safe place. Chief has already sent people to deal with those bastards who attacked you.

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>

*... Question: This unit's current location.*

**Member D**<br>
Do you not recognize this room? This is Nora's old room. She doesn't use this room anymore now.

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*………*

**Member D**<br>
Chief has ordered you to stay here and not move... It seems that she can no longer issue commands to you.

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*This unit's command is, to protect Nora.*

**Member D**<br>
Protect? Save that for yourself.<br>
Nowadays, she protects herself more securely than anyone in this world. Even we have difficulties approaching her sometimes.

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*………*

**Member D**<br>
On the contrary, your actions have caused us some serious trouble... In short, stay here and don't mess around. I have no idea what she's gonna do with you either. I have to go back to work. Don't wander around, understand?
