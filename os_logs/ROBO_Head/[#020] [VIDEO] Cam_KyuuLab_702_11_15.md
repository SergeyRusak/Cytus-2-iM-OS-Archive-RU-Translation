Ha, ha... haha; see! I didn't lie to you! I told you I was going to help you find her. Well, now you found her! <br>
On top of that, she's the Chief of Kyuu Hou Kai. Hahaha!<br>

Wait! Please wait! Sir, it's a misunderstanding! I'm not from another gang. My family grows fruit next to Genmu Boulevard! Please be nice and let me go. I'll treat sir to some grapes next time...
