## Log Content
**Ichiro**<br>
Welcome to my home. Not a fancy place, but still home.

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Ichiro's home.*

**Ichiro**<br>
Grandma, we have a visitor.

**Sonoko**<br>
Woah, that's a big robot.

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Ichiro's grandmother, registering...<br>
Greetings.*

**Sonoko**<br>
I'll go pour you some tea... Ah, Mr. Robot doesn't drink tea, right?

**Ichiro**<br>
Haha, it's alright. You should rest. Don't need to worry about us.

*\[ROBO_Head waves\]*

**Ichiro**<br>
... My grandma is a lot healthier now. It's all thanks to Nora and Kyubo Medical Center.<br>
A lot of things have happened since you left...

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*This unit, wants to hear.*

**Ichiro**<br>
You've probably seen it already, what Nora looks like now...

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*......*

**Ichiro**<br>
The night I helped you guys run away... four years have passed since then?<br>
After you left, both Nora and I were captured by Mogura and taken back. I totally thought I was going to die at first. I only managed to avoid death because Nora offered up herself as the sacrifice. However, as a result, I wasn't allowed to stay in Kyuu Hou Kai anymore.

**Ichiro**<br>
But around one year ago, she founded the Kyubo Medical Center and got Daigo to secretly give me a job in that industry. Thanks to that, both grandma and I are living pretty well right now. 

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Nora... what happened to her?*

**Ichiro**<br>
Well... I've only heard about this myself too. Apparently, Mogura forced her to use the "Eye of Horus" ability whenever they wanted to... So many terrible things have happened in the organization in these past few years, and Nora saw all of them occur in front of her eyes. In order to reduce her pain, she gradually... sealed off her emotions. My guess is that she probably did a lot of the terrible things herself too...

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*......*

**Ichiro**<br>
After that, by relying on her smarts, she was able to set up a new partnership and business with Mogura. She also took over as Chief. However, her body finally succumbed under all of this. In the end, she couldn't even use her eyes anymore... but with how much profit she brings to Mogura, they don't seem to care about this too much.

**Ichiro**<br>
I truly feel sorry... All the sacrifices she made, was likely to protect us and the Kyuu Hou Kai Director left behind... Yet there's nothing I could do for her, despite all the things she had done for me...

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*... During the time this unit was not around, Nora...*

**Ichiro**<br>
I originally thought that she would be better after seeing you. At least she could be reminded of the times she was happy. Yet from the looks of it, that's not the case...

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Question: How did Ichiro know about this unit?*

**Ichiro**<br>
To be honest, it was Daigo who told me about you. He wanted me to take you back to my home first since it's way too risky for you to be standing on the streets like that.

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Risky?*

**Ichiro**<br>
Yeah. The Mogura people still very much want you dead! Nora's promise to them was that you'd never return to Node 03, nor would you ever interfere with the organization's business.

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*......*

**Ichiro**<br>
All in all, staying outside is dangerous. For now, you should stay here.

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*This unit...... protects Nora.*

**Ichiro**<br>
... No good no good! Did you no hear what I just told you!?

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Nora now, is not happy. This, is not what she wants; this unit, affirmative.*

**Ichiro**<br>
What she wants...

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Nora wants to have her own life, to chase her own dreams. This unit, will provide assistance with that.*

**Ichiro**<br>
......

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Ichiro, should help, too.*

**Ichiro**<br>
I...

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*There is something Ichiro can do for her. <br>
Ichiro, can help her too.*

**Ichiro**<br>
... Understood. I'll get Daigo and we can figure out a way together. However, you should still stay here for the next few days. Just in case.

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Understood.*

*[Signal Lost]*
