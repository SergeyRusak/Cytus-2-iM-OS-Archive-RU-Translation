*\[Door Opens\]*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*......!<br>
Nora.*

*\[ROBO_Head emotion\]*

**[Nora]**<br>
*... Give me your hand.*

**ROBO_Head**<br>
......?

*\[Extends hand\]*

*\[Removing parts\]*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*......!?<br>
Nora... what are you going to do?*

**[Nora]**<br>
*Removing the weapon Ichiro installed in your hand.*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*......?<br>
Weapon, can protect everyone.*

**Nora**<br>
......

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*This unit, don't understand.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*... Enough. Stop talking.*

**ROBO_Head**<br>
......

*\[Lights Off\]*

**ROBO_Head**<br>
!?

**[Nora]**<br>
*......Eh?<br>
W... what happened? I... I can't see anything...*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Main power source, power supply interrupted.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*How come... Daigo, Daigo! Can you hear me?*

**[Member D]**<br>
*Ch......<br>
Chief... This is Daigo. The signal is very weak. What is happening!?*

**[Nora]**<br>
*I'm not sure either. Report the situation outside to me immediately.*

**[Member D]**<br>
*The entire power supply for Kyuu Hou Kai has gone offline! We are currently investigating the reason. Not certain if this is yet another attack... Where is Chief now!?*

**[Nora]**<br>
*... I'm in ROBO's room. There's an old terminal here. I'll use it to connect to the system and see what's going on.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*But... my eyes...*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Nora, please let this unit, be your eyes.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*......! I'll give it a try.<br>
ROBO's angle of view... Excellent. The terminal is behind that wall. Push me there as well.*

*\[Terminal Connection\]*

**[Nora]**<br>
*This is... This again, the exact same attack pattern as the one that just happened...<br>
So things really turned out the same as what I imagined?*

*\[Access Denied\]*

**[Nora]**<br>
*Ugh... who... who are you exactly? What is your purpose?*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Nora, who are you talking to...?*

**[Nora]**<br>
*... Be quiet.*

*\[Access Denied\]*

**[Nora]**<br>
*Damnit, no good... I can't decipher his attack. Have to hurry up and restore the power, or else Miss Sherry Pauline...*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Miss Cherry is in danger?*

**[Nora]**<br>
*If the life support system stops functioning... No good, there's nothing I can do from here at all. I can't even open the door due to the power outage...*

*\[Removing parts\]*

**[Nora]**<br>
*!?<br>
ROBO, what are you doing?*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*This unit's core, able to generate power on its own, is created by Nora. Thus, can connect to terminal and provide mass power. Can temporarily restore power to facility.*

**Nora**<br>
......!

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*This unit, uncertain about procedure to use. Would like Nora, to take over.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*... To provide the entire facility... No, even if it's just providing power for one area, your motherboard will be fried, without a doubt. That level of damage is irreparable. Not even I can fix that.*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Nora very important, to this unit. But, friend that played music together, also very important. This unit, wants to help, wants to save Miss Cherry.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*......<br>
Understood.*

*\[Connection\]*

**[Nora]**<br>
*... ROBO, this will completely destroy your core and memory unit. Even if we repair your mechanical frame, you...*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*This unit, very happy.*

**Nora**<br>
......?

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*This unit, understand; Nora, fears that emotions will cause herself pain. Thus, acts indifferent to this unit, indifferent to everyone.<br>
But Nora, didn't change.*

**Nora**<br>
......!<br>
......

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*This unit, is prepared.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*......<br>
... Ugh...*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*...... Nora? The time...*

**[Nora]**<br>
*... \*Sobs\*...*

**ROBO_Head**<br>
......?

**[Nora]**<br>
*... I...<br>
... \*Sobs\*... I'm sorry...<br>
I'm sorry... I'm sorry...*

**[Nora]**<br>
*WAHHHHHHHH!!*
