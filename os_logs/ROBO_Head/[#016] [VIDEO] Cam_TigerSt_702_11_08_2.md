*\*Huff\*... \*puff\*... *

**Thug A**<br>
You bastard! Stay where you are!

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*……？*

**???**<br>
WAAHHH!!

*\[Crash\]*

**???**<br>
Owwwww... a drone? What is this doing here?

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Apologies, will run diagnosis for you right away.<br>
Sir, you have symptoms of nosebleed, skewed nose bridge, bruises and more. <br>
Decision: Your face has suffered physical trauma.*

**???**<br>
No s\*\*\*! You can tell that by just looking!<br>
......Hmm!? Your body...

**Thug B**<br>
Surround them! Surround them!

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Sir, please move to the front of this unit in order for this unit to continue the diagnosis.*

**???**<br>
Be quiet for now... Ahahaha, umm... Hi, fellas! Let's not resort to violence. We can talk things out!

**Thug C**<br>
Return that thing, Yamada! I'll make sure you leave this place in one piece if you do!

**Yamada**<br>
I have no idea what you're talking about. What thing? All I have is some money for a drink...

**Thug A**<br>
Ha, nice acting you got there. Do you think we're that stupid?? Huh!?

**Thug B**<br>
You're not gonna fool anybody. Take it out, now!

**Yamada**<br>
... Hey, robot, what's your name?

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*This unit's codename is "ROBO\_Head \- Unit 02".*

**Yamada**<br>
ROBO... Too long. I'll just call you Robo.<br>
Robo, they're framing me for stealing. You have a combat function, right? Help me get rid of them.

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*What, did you steal?*

**Yamada**<br>
Nothing at all. They just made it up. Trust me...

**Thug C**<br>
Robot, step aside or we'll trash you too!

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Please wait a second. This unit, currently understanding the situation...*

**Yamada**<br>
Be careful, they are the thugs from the Tawata group. They're a notorious gang around this area. They bury anyone who opposes them in concrete, super scary!

**Thug A**<br>
What the f\*\*\* is concrete? Stop making s\*\*\* up! Guess we'll have to beat you up until you can keep that damn mouth shut!

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*... Please wait a second.<br>
The Sir here said that he did not steal from you. Is there some kind of misunderstanding?*

**Thug C**<br>
And what does that have to do with you? F\*\*\* off!

*\[Knocking on metal\]*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Attack detected<br>
This unit, enter security mode. Power output increase by 250%.*

**Thug C**<br>
!?

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*This unit's outer shell is made from alloys. Your guns, aren't capable of damaging this unit. Please back away.*

*\[Heavy Blow\]*

**Thug A, B, C**<br>
！？！？！？

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*... This unit thinks, violence is bad.*

*\[Wall collapses\]*

**Thug A**<br>
You... you bastard! You trying to protect him!?

**Thug B**<br>
H\-hey, let's go! We're not gonna beat this guy...

*\[Hurried Footsteps\]*

**Yamada**<br>
Whew... you saved my a\*\*.<br>
My eyes didn't let me down. Your shell and crucial parts are all military grade stuff. You're awesome, Robo.

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*This unit, was created to protect Nora.*

**Yamada**<br>
What are you talking about...? Who is your master? 

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*... Unknown, this unit's memory unit, damaged.<br>
Have you seen this girl before? Her name is Nora.*

**Yamada**<br>
Who? This brat? Never seen her before.

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Thank you for your answer.*

**Yamada**<br>
In short, I'm relieved. Both this baby and I need to thank you for the help back there.<br>
Take a look, whaddaya think? Pretty, eh?

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Analysis: Titanium, S\-class rare metal. Light in weight, high in strength. According to the laws of Node 03 Administration Bureau, those without a license are not allowed to possess, purchase or sell this metal.<br>
... Sir, do you have a license?*

**Yamada**<br>
There's no way I have one, right?<br>
I grabbed this from their safe... Had to run for a really damn long time to get away from them. Good thing I was able to keep it.

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*……！？*

**Yamada**<br>
Don't look at me like that. They're illegally owning it too. I just took something that never belonged to them in the first place and sold it on the market. That doesn't count as "stealing".<br>
Thank you for your help. See ya\~

*\[Footsteps\]*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*... This unit, was deceived?*

*[Signal Lost]*
