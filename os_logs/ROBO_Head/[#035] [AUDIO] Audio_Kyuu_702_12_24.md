**ConneR**<br>
I see... A vaccine for "The Ender" virus, is it?

**[Nora]**<br>
*Yes. Miss PAFF's physique that allows her to co\-exist with "The Ender" virus. I used her genes to try and produce a sample vaccine. In theory, it can suppress the virus from being activated into an unobservable state while inside the human body... but it hasn't been tested.*

**ConneR**<br>
This is truly a revolutionary invention, Miss Nora. I assume you haven't revealed this information to anybody yet?

**[Nora]**<br>
*Of course. But if who we are dealing with is Æsir, a hacker who can carry out multiple large\-scale attacks, It's pretty much impossible to hide this information.*

**ConneR**<br>
What about the motive? Plotting such a precise attack, all for destroying this one little test tube?

**[Nora]**<br>
*To be honest, I didn't come up with that... I'll have Miss PAFF explain it.*

**ConneR**<br>
... Oh?

*\[Door Opens\]*

**PAFF**<br>
Mr. Neumann, right? Hello, NEKO mentioned you before... I heard that, in the end, you let her pass.

**ConneR**<br>
Hehe, Miss Kitten is a lively girl. How could I keep her locked up in such a dull place like the Academy? Miss PAFF, I've heard about you as well; you're much more natural and poised than I've been told.

**PAFF**<br>
There are many reasons for that... Ah, as for why the vaccine was destroyed, that is merely a speculation...

**ConneR**<br>
Please, go on. I'm all ears.

**PAFF**<br>
... A while ago, when I was using the ability, I felt this powerful, very powerful evil intent... and the target of that intent was all of mankind. It's an abhorrent feeling of hatred... It was as if it wanted to annihilate all of humanity.

**ConneR**<br>
......!

**PAFF**<br>
I'm not sure what it was... but after Nora told me her thoughts on the matter, I was even more certain... I know I can't come up with detailed and insightful hypotheses like you two, but... I don't know. There's just a voice in my heart that tells me this is so.

**ConneR**<br>
... Miss Nora, what do you think?

**[Nora]**<br>
*As a former user of the ability, I understand what it means to experience these feelings. When you experience the emotional center of another being, that subtle ripple can only be completely understood by the one involved.<br>
Thus, I trust Miss PAFF's judgment.*

**ConneR**<br>
I see. There's no melody that's more convincing than one that's grounded in theory and infused with emotion. This conclusion fits with all the signs we've encountered as well... Furthermore, if an attack's carried out with the virus, that'll be doom for all mankind.

**PAFF**<br>
We can't let that happen! Otherwise, everyone will...

**[Nora]**<br>
*......*

*\[Alarm\]*

**[Kyuu Hou Kai System]**<br>
*Warning, electrical system error.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*What's going on?*

**ConneR**<br>
... Could it be another attack?

*\[Typing on keyboard\]*

**[Nora]**<br>
*No, the source of the surge is in the guest room... ROBO!?*

*[→Signal Switches]*

*\[Door Opens\]*

**[Nora]**<br>
ROBO! ... Are you okay!?

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*......<br>
No... ra. This unit... is fine.*

*\[Typing on keyboard\]*

**[Nora]**<br>
*... Did you connect these circuits yourself? An immense increase in electricity usage in such a short time...a simulation calculation... what are you doing?*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*This unit... simulated linking with Mr. ConneR's chip, calculating tolerance levels under conditions of a sustained link. If successful, Mr. ConneR can gather more information.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*...! And the results?*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*At peak level computation rates, this unit estimated, a stable link can be formed, increasing linkage time by 4000%.<br>
Decision: The formation of this unit's core, similar to part of the chip. Also, this unit suspects, that this unit entered into the "OS" space for an interval of 2.8 seconds.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*......！<br>
It's true... When I designed you, some of the components came from A.R.C, technology recovered from ancient civilizations... Don't move, let me check.*

**ConneR**<br>
Ho? Getting access to the "Eye" for a brief instant? Now that makes things really interesting...

*\[Dismantling Parts\]*

**[Nora]**<br>
*This won't work... Even if the flow rate reached its target, the strength of the core is still limited. Physically, it couldn't possibly stabilize... What's more, I didn't issue such a command.*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*This unit... understands.<br>
But, this unit, wants to help Nora too.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*... I didn't want you...*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*This unit understands, Nora values everyone. Mr. Daigo, Mr. Ichiro, Miss PAFF, and the citizens of Node 03... Nora wants to protect them all. The existence of the Kyubo Medical Center is proof of that.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*... I...*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*This unit, was created to protect Nora... When we lost Miss Pauline, Nora was crying, thus creating emotions that Nora cannot express... That happened because this unit, didn't protect everyone, didn't protect Nora.*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Mr. ConneR said, that many more people will die because of this incident. If that happens, Nora will cry again... This unit, is willing to try anything, even if it's just a small possibility, this unit will try.*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*This unit... also very much likes the people Nora treasures.*

**Nora**<br>
......

*\[Typing on keyboard\]*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*... Nora?*

**[Nora]**<br>
... I've set up the security system. Once everyone leaves HQ, Kyuu Hou Kai will be in a state of lockdown. No one will be able to get in from outside and no one will be able to gather any information from here.

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Leave?*

*\[Wheelchair moving\]*

**[Nora]**<br>
*ROBO, get prepared. We're about to head out.*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Planning route of action. What is the destination?*

**[Nora]**<br>
*Node 08.*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*... Understood. Nora has never gone there before. Please, allow this unit to guide Nora there.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*Okay.<br>
... ROBO, I know you want to help. But next time, before you do something, let me know. Don't just proceed on your own, get it?*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*This unit, will listen to Nora.*

*\[ROBO emotion\]*

*[Signal Lost]*
