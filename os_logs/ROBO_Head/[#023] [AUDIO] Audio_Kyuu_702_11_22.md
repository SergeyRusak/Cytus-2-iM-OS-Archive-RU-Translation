*\[Opens umbrella\]*

**???**<br>
ROBO!

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*......?<br>
May I ask who you are?*

**???**<br>
It's me! Ichiro! Do you not remember me...?

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Searching database...<br>
Murata Ichiro, a friend. Still alive.*

**Ichiro**<br>
Of course I'm still alive! What is this? Some kind of robot joke?

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*No, this unit is... very happy.*

**Ichiro**<br>
... Are you waiting for Nora?

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*... Affirmative.*

**Ichiro**<br>
I'm afraid that she's not going to see you... Come with me first.

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*......*

**Ichiro**<br>
Even though your parts are waterproof, constantly getting drenched in this kind of rain will still cause some issues. Besides... it's not safe for you to keep staying here. All in all, come with me first. Trust me.

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Understood. Ichiro, helped us before. A good person.*

*[Signal Lost]*
