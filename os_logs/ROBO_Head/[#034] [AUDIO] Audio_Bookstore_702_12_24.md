**ConneR**<br>
This bookstore is much more shabbier than I imagined, haha. Shall I utter the secret code? I'm looking for "The Ninth...

**Member D**<br>
No need. You already made an appointment with the Chief, haven't you? This way, Mr. Neumann.

**ConneR**<br>
What a shame. I've always wanted to use a code word... Please, lead the way.

*[→Signal Switches]*

**ConneR**<br>
You are Miss Nora? I heard of your age long ago, but seeing you in person, it's still quite surprising... It's an honor to meet you.<br>
Mr. ROBO\_Head, I never thought we'd meet under such conditions.

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Mr. ConneR, hello.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*I've read many of your papers too, Mr. Neumann. However, enough with the conventional greetings.<br>
You said that you made major progress regarding the investigation of the incident. I'd like to get right into it.*

**ConneR**<br>
Of course. Let's corroborate the sheet music in each other's hand. However, before that...

**[Nora]**<br>
*What's the matter?*

**ConneR**<br>
Based on my understanding, the other "Eye of Horus" user is also here as a guest. Don't know if I'll have the honor of meeting her?

**[Nora]**<br>
*Not a problem. However, Miss PAFF is currently resting. We will arrange that soon.*

**ConneR**<br>
Excellent. Then allow me to begin by performing the first movement. This is my main instrument.

*\[Projection\]*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Analysis: Microchip, model number unknown.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*... Looks like it has been around for quite some time, yet the structure is extremely intricate... What is this chip?*

**ConneR**<br>
An artifact handed down by my ancestors. I'll just go ahead and start with conclusions: It's clear that this is high level technology from ancient civilization, and it's highly possibly that it was created by the Architects. Although the details of its use are unclear... I've tried to connect my own brain with it, and the images I saw was what I meant by "major progress".

**[Nora]**<br>
*......!*

**ConneR**<br>
A memory file from several hundred years ago directly played out inside my brain... It was like traveling through time, truly a very interesting experience. Nonetheless, since humans and Architects aren't even remotely similar, I was unable to catch a glimpse of the entire picture. All I can determine as of now is that it contains the memory of some Architect.

**[Nora]**<br>
*... The density of this data... excluding those with the ability, if an ordinary person's brain were to be suddenly exposed to such an enormous amount of pressure...*

**ConneR**<br>
Correct. Embarrassing to say, but I collapsed right on the spot and immediately cut the connection... Though I suspect that since it's just a simple data transmission, perhaps it could be processed in sync by linking up with other equipment. In theory, we could lengthen the usage time and even discover the chip's other functions.

**ROBO_Head**<br>
......

**[Nora]**<br>
*"Ivy"... is it? The one you brought up in the call.*

**ConneR**<br>
No, I believe she isn't the owner of this piece of memory. She's the unit that appeared in the field of vision during the dialogue.

**[Nora]**<br>
*… Is that so? In any case, the Architects... are the key to everything?*

**ConneR**<br>
I want to hear Miss Nora's thougths on the matter. Both you and Miss PAFF mentioned that you encountered what we suspect is an Architect's consciousness in the OS space.

**[Nora]**<br>
*These robots that once rebuilt and managed human society should have all disappeared during "The Decomission". But  after we investigated the lead you provided... It shows that there is indeed a possibilty that an Architect is still active in Node 08.*

**ConneR**<br>
I like where you're going. Please, continue.

**[Nora]**<br>
*Based on the difficulties Mr. Jackson and co. encountered, if the mastermind behind the Æsir attacks was indeed an Architect, despite the motive remaining unclear, it would resolve many questionable points in this incident.*

**ConneR**<br>
Exactly. Large scale hacking incidents, a series of drone attacks, even A.R.C... no, Mr. Jackson's security technology being decrypted, it's hard to imagine anyone besides an Architect who could do all of that. I believe that everything leading up to today has something to do with them.

**ConneR**<br>
These ghosts, concealed by history, are difficult to track. However, we can deduce from the experiences of you two that "The Eye of Horus" is the one path that will lead us to them. The stage... will be set where it all began, Node 08.

**[Nora]**<br>
*I see. That's why you wanted to see Miss PAFF.*

**ConneR**<br>
Hehe, to me, those with exceptional innate abilities are as majestic as violin concertos from past generations. On top of that, her ability may be the last key that we currently have. If we're going to go back to open the door, she is absolutely necessary.

**[Nora]**<br>
*...I understand. I'll have it arranged.*

**ConneR**<br>
Greatly appreciated. There is one unsolved riddle that still remains concerning this attack... Miss Nora, any leads?

**[Nora]**<br>
*The purpose of attacking Kyuu Hou Kai, right? I believe I do have an answer.<br>
ROBO, wait here. I'll take Mr. Neumann to the central lab.*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Central lab has been seriously damaged, not safe.<br>
Please allow this unit to follow.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*Don't worry. I'll let Daigo follow along.<br>
Mr. Neumann, please come with me.*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Understood.*
