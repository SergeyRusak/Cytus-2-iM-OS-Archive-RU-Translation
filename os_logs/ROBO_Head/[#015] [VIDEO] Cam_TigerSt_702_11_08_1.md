... This is rare, an unmanned drone in 03.

**Pedestrian C**<br>
It's a giant one too. Is there something you want?

*Have you seen this girl before? Her name is Nora.*

**Pedestrian B**<br>
... What is this? Some sort of new scam?<br>
Ohh, but this is a cute girl. Another five years and she'll be one heck of a beauty.

You goddamn lolicon... No, we've never seen her before.

You'll never find her if you just wander around like this.

Alright, now move out of the way.
