**Member D**<br>
Chief, the car is ready.

**[Nora]**<br>
*... Why is he still there?*

![ros2201.png](./attachments/ros2201.png)
**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*......*

**Member D**<br>
Apologies... we just couldn't drive him away. No matter how far we dump him, he would always return and proceed to stand there. It has been several days already...

**Nora**<br>
......

**Member D**<br>
Send him to another Node?

**[Nora]**<br>
*He'll still figure out a way to come back.*

**Member D**<br>
It'll get really ugly if the Mogura people catch wind of this. Maybe we should...

**[Nora]**<br>
*Ignore him. We're running short on time. Let's go.*

**Member D**<br>
Yes, Chief.

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*......*

*[→Signal Switches]*

**Ryu**<br>
Calling me to this place... You like to talk business in this kind of rain?

**[Nora]**<br>
*Your Butsudou is already tapped by at least two organizations. Do you realize that?*

**Ryu**<br>
\*Chuckles\* Of course I do. Let them hear all they want. Our status in Node 03 as the "Dragon Phoenix Combo" is already impregnable. A leaked secret or two won't make much of a difference to us.

**[Nora]**<br>
*I don't like to have a third party around when I'm talking.*

**Ryu**<br>
Fair enough. Here's the share for this month, as well as the report.

**[Nora]**<br>
*Daigo.*

**Member D**<br>
Yes, Chief.

*\[Data transfer\]*

**Ryu**<br>
This is spectacular. When Phoenix was gone, I previously thought it was going to be a major loss. Turns out you were the greatest treasure all this time. Look at all these numbers.

**Nora**<br>
......

**Ryu**<br>
Thanks to the establishment of the Kyubo Medical Center, not only have we created the biggest business chain this organization has ever seen, but we're also highly revered and respect among the civilians.

**[Nora]**<br>
*... The resources allocated to the downtown area and area 11 are not enough.<br>
I hope that starting next month, the Administration Bureau can increase the resource output to these two areas by at least 10%.*

**Ryu**<br>
Still asking for the impossible, eh... Nora, we still have other things we need to tend to. I know the health of the civilians is important, but that's not our main business.

**[Nora]**<br>
A while ago, there was a batch of weapons that should've been smuggled to Node 08. The buyer ended up not receiving the cargo. We temporarily took responsibility for that screw\-up in place of you guys. I don't think you are qualified to bargain over this stuff with me right now.

**Ryu**<br>
......

**[Nora]**<br>
*I may not be able to use my "eyes" freely anymore, but I am still very well aware of every single screw\-up of yours. I advise you to not try to hide anything from me.*

**Ryu**<br>
Alright, alright. I'll take care of this case. You can rest assured on that.

**[Nora]**<br>
*I've received the report. All the cargo is here. Besides what I just mentioned, all other guidelines will remain unchanged.*

**Ryu**<br>
You've truly become outstanding at this job... Maybe one day you'll surpass me and kick me down from the top.

**[Nora]**<br>
*Are you threatening me with that comment?*

**Ryu**<br>
Not at all. Why would I?<br>
This is a place where profit and ability trump everything else. If someone can come in and break the ceiling that I've failed to crack for so many years, I'd be ecstatic. If me being replaced at the top is what it takes, so be it.

**[Nora]**<br>
*Unfortunately, I am not interested in 70% of the businesses you currently have. That day will never arrive.*

**Ryu**<br>
Is that so...

**Mogura Member**<br>
Boss, the amount is correct.

**[Nora]**<br>
*Then we'll take our leave. Daigo.*

**Ryu**<br>
Ah, right... speaking of "hiding", I think the same goes for you too, right?

**Nora**<br>
......?

**Ryu**<br>
I heard that your pet robot came back?

**Nora**<br>
......!

**Ryu**<br>
No need to be so tense.<br>
I'm not the kind of person who holds grudges. Our current partnership is very perfect, and I have no intention to disrupt this relation...<br>
I'll pretend that I didn't see it. That makes us even.

**[Nora]**<br>
*... Good. Daigo, start the car. Let's go.*

*\[Car door opens\]*

**Ryu**<br>
... That's right. I'm indeed not that kind of person. However, I can't say as much for the folks who serve under me. They're... a bit hard to control, I'd say.<br>
You guys should know what to do, right?

**Mogura Member**<br>
Yes, Boss.

*[→Signal Switches]*

*\[Gate Opens\]*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*......*

**Member D**<br>
Chief, he's still there... What should we do? The things Ryu just said...

**[Nora]**<br>
*Let's go inside. We still got work to do.*

**Member D**<br>
... Yes, Chief.

*[Signal Lost]*
