I haven't seen her. Go away. I'm busy.

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Thank you for your answer.*

**Yamada**<br>
Yo, Robo! You still remember me?

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*... Mr. Yamada.*

**Yamada**<br>
Hehe, you are a lot smarter than what your appearance implies. However, allow me to remind you, the news that there's a robot looking for a loli in this area is now widespread. Both sides already know that you're here.

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*... This unit, understands. Mr. Yamada, seeks out this unit, for what purpose?*

**Yamada**<br>
Well, I'll keep things short: There's something I want to ask you for help.

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*This unit refuses. Mr. Yamada deceived this unit, a bad person.*

**Yamada**<br>
Bad? I don't know what you're talking about. Why am I bad?

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Mr. Yamada has eight criminal records in Node 03's Administration Bureau. Ever since you were a teenager, you began stealing gang information and precious items to sell on the black market. Mr. Yamada is, criminal with repeated offenses. This unit, should not help Mr. Yamada.*

**Yamada**<br>
Hey, compared to me, the people I steal from are the true bad guys! I sell those things simply because I need to feed myself. It's not like I'm using that money to murder people and destroy stuff. What's the big deal with that?

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*This unit will be leaving.*

*\[Metal Footsteps\]*

**Yamada**<br>
Tch... Hey, the girl you're looking for, her name's Nora, right? I can help you out.

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*... Mr. Yamada, has clues about Nora?*

**Yamada**<br>
Are you freakin kidding me?<br>
I've been dealing with gangs when I was still a student at the Academy! I have plenty of connections! People come to me for all kinds of info.<br>
You've got some kind of connection to Kyuu Hou Kai, right?

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Related records, indeed exist. However, number of records, few.<br>
Mr. Yamada's, basis of that decision is?*

**Yamada**<br>
I found out by looking at your body. Some of the parts have a raven insignia on them... which means you're definitely a robot made by Kyuu Hou Kai.

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*………*

**Yamada**<br>
Speaking of Kyuu Hou Kai, I remembered another rumor... The "Eye of Horus" from a few years ago, the prophet with amazing abilities. Apparently, that person belongs to Kyuu Hou Kai as well.

**Yamada**<br>
Rumor has it that the "Eye of Horus" was actually a little girl... That girl is Nora, isn't it?

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*... This unit, memory unit damaged. Decision unavailable.*

**Yamada**<br>
Welp, at least that would be my guess, hehe.

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*………*

**Yamada**<br>
Lemme tell you. My target this time happens to be in that mysterious Kyuu Hou Kai. It's an A.I. document about Intelligent Caretakers...

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Keyword search: Intelligent Caretaker... complete.<br>
"Kyubo Medical Center's" medical project "Project P"?*

**Yamada**<br>
Exactly. Someone is paying good money for that document. I want to get my hands on it, and you will help me get inside Kyuu Hou Kai.

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*But, it's a document related to medical fields... "The development of medical technology is deeply connected to the survival of humans. It has the highest priority. Do not interfere unless absolutely necessary."... Nora, once said so.*

**Yamada**<br>
That's right. Something that important should be shared and used by more people. It shouldn't be locked inside a tiny cabinet collecting dust, right?<br>
Lemme tell you, this is called "Helping the people". If Nora knew about this, she would be very happy too.

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*... Nora... happy...?*

**Yamada**<br>
See, what we have here is a simple deal: you help me get inside, I help you get info on Nora. Or else, you're not gonna make any progress even if you stay here your whole life.<br>
I'm doing you a favor, ya know?

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*... Mr. Yamada, is not lying to this unit?*

**Yamada**<br>
Ha? You're the dude who saved my life. Why would I lie to you?

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Lying, is bad.*

**Yamada**<br>
... If you had also grown up in this trash heap of a place, you would know that here, not lying means death. This is what Node 03 is, a hell filled with chaos.

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Chaos?*

**Yamada**<br>
Yep. You're a robot and you're super strong. You probably never had to lie your whole life, right? But unlike you, I don't have a shell made out of metal alloys and iron fists. If I want to live, I have to be this way.

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*……。*

**Yamada**<br>
Whatever, you don't understand this, do you... I'll take it that you've agreed to this partnership. At 02:00 a.m. the day after tomorrow, come find me at these coordinates.

*\[Data transfer\]*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*...... Understood.*

**Yamada**<br>
Hehe, looking forward to working with you.

*\[Footsteps\]*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*... Lying... <br>
In the past, this unit... for Nora...*
