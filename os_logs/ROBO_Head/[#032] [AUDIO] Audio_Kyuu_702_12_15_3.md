**[Nora]**<br>
*All in all, both of you should be exhausted. I am very thankful that you're still willing to stay here. Please get some rest. I must now go back to clean up this mess.*

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Member D**<br>
Chief, about Miss Pauline's body... we've got everything arranged and ready to go.

**Nora**<br>
......

**Member D**<br>
We've also contacted those in Node 08 who are affected by this, including Luis Pauline, Joe Miller and all her known friends on the list. Her father will apply for a temporary parole from the restricted area so he can organize his daughter's funeral.

**[Nora]**<br>
*... What about the public announcement? Miss Pauline is considered a celebrity figure in Node 08.*

**Member D**<br>
Yes. We've dealt with all the issues regarding the agency through our connections. This is the press release; death by accident. No mention of the organization what so ever.

**Nora**<br>
......

**Member D**<br>
Chief... are you alright...?

**[Nora]**<br>
*I'm... feeling a bit tired. Can I leave you in charge of the clean up for now?*

**Member D**<br>
Certainly! But what about you...

**[Nora]**<br>
*The priority is to repair the defenses in area 03. Within two hours, I want a written report with all the damages listed on it.*

**Member D**<br>
Chief... are you really alright...?

**[Nora]**<br>
*Can you do it?*

**Member D**<br>
... Yes.

*\[Wheelchair moving\]*

**Member D**<br>

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*......<br>
Nora, question: Miss Cherry...*

**[Nora]**<br>
*You fixed all these instruments...*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*......<br>
Affirmative.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*......<br>
Why...?*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Answer: Nora, has dreams of music. This unit, saw broken instruments. This unit, hopes Nora can...*

**[Nora]**<br>
*Why did you come back?*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*This unit, wants to protect Nora.*

**Nora**<br>
......

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Nora...?*

**[Nora]**<br>
*Miss Pauline... is dead.*

**ROBO_Head**<br>
......!

**[Nora]**<br>
*I... couldn't do it. I was unable to recover the power in time. I caused her death.*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*... Not Nora's fault. This unit...*

**[Nora]**<br>
*Do you think... it's your fault?*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*......<br>
... Unable to analyze.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*... That's because your emotions are a lot more complicated than you think.*

**ROBO_Head**<br>
......

**[Nora]**<br>
*I... I don't know anymore. What is right? What is wrong?*

**ROBO_Head**<br>
......

**[Nora]**<br>
*When I couldn't destroy you, it felt... painful. Was I... crying back then? I thought I was experiencing my own emotions... for the first time since that incident——Yet after seeing Miss Pauline, I was still able to handle everything so calmly...*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*... Nora...*

**[Nora]**<br>
*Tell me, ROBO; right now... what do you feel?*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*... Emotion simulation keyword searching...<br>
Keywords: self\-blame, regret, sadness... anger.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*... Is that so? You are me... Then perhaps... that's just how it is, right...? However, we both don't know how to express these emotions, or should I say, that we've both lost this function...*

**ROBO_Head**<br>
......

**[Nora]**<br>
*ROBO, can you... lock the door? I don't want other people... to see my face right now.*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*... Understood.*
