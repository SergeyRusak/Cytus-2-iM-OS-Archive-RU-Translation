**Yamada**<br>
The trapdoor is right ahead. Follow me.

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Mr. Yamada, how much you know, about Kyuu Hou Kai?*

**Yamada**<br>
... Never thought a robot would ask this many questions. What exactly did they write in your program when they made you back then?

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*This unit, wants to know.*

**Yamada**<br>
Whatever, guess I'll tell you. Kyuu Hou Kai was previously just a science research organization founded by a few scientists with criminal records. They have a partnership with Mogura... You should at least know what Mogura is, right?

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Searching database... search complete.<br>
Node 03's largest gang organization. Deeply connected with the Administration Bureau of 03. Has branches across all Nodes. One such example is the Baro Brotherhood in Node 08.*

**Yamada**<br>
Ha, are you a walking Basicpedia or something?<br>
In the past few years, Kyuu Hou Kai has gradually extended its business to other fields. A lot of their new technology was then introduced to the general public, which made them quite a fortune... That money allowed them to gradually free themselves from Mogura's grasp. Right now, the two are pretty much on even footing.

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Like the  "Kyubo Medical Center"?*

**Yamada**<br>
That's right. Cover\-up companies like that are merely facades. It's pretty much a known secret among gang members.

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*......*

**Yamada**<br>
We're here. This is a pipe used for dumping waste. It shuts down temporarily at certain intervals. Come, use your iron fists to tear open this blastproof door. Then we can sneak inside without anyone noticing us.

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Understood. This unit, initiating removal operations, now*

*\[Heavy Blow\]*

*[â†’Signal Switches]*

**Yamada**<br>
Woah, it's quite spacious inside. Thank goodness I have a pipeline map...

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*......*

**Yamada**<br>
Listen carefully. You go in this direction and walk for 3 blocks, then wait 35 seconds at the annular node. This should get you into the server room that stores documents. Last but not least, you just plug this thingy in and we'll have the document.

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Here... this unit, remembers.*

**Yamada**<br>
Robo?

*\[Metal Footsteps\]*

**Yamada**<br>
Not that way... Yikes, what is this machine? It looks like it should've been trashed a long time ago.

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*This machine is known as the "silent chamber". It is used to treat brain diseases. It is capable of providing the patient with a completely silent environment to heal. It can also detect and analyze the patient's brainwave frequency and stabilize it.*

**Yamada**<br>
Whatever. We can't take this with us anyway.<br>
Hey, why are you staring so hard at it? There's nobody inside.

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*... Nora, doesn't need to use it now, does she?*

*\[Metal Footsteps\]*

**Yamada**<br>
I told you not that way! Where are you going!?

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*The way to Phoenix's lab, is this direction...*

**Yamada**<br>
Get your a\*\* back here! Didn't we say we're gonna help each other? You need to help me finish my job first...

*\[Lights on\]*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*!?*

**Kyuu Hou Kai Member**<br>
You damn rats! You've been surrounded!

**Yamada**<br>
How come!? There shouldn't be anyone here at this time!?

**Kyuu Hou Kai Member**<br>
Naive... The very moment you broke the blastproof door, you've already triggered the alarm system Chief installed. We've had our eyes on you guys for a long time!

**Yamada**<br>
D, Damnit...

**Kyuu Hou Kai Member**<br>
Raise your hands above your head! Or else we'll turn you into swiss cheese right here right now!

**Yamada**<br>
... Robo, smash the wall! We can only rely on you now!

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*This unit, refuses.*

**Yamada**<br>
What are you thinking!? If they capture you, you're definitely gonna get taken apart and you'll get experimented on... Wah! Let go of me!

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Apologies, Mr. Yamada. This unit, doesn't want to run.*

**Yamada**<br>
Huh!?

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Here, is this unit's home.<br>
This unit, has... come home.*

*[Signal Lost]*
