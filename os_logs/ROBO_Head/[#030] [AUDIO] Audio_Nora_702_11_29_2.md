**[Nora]**<br>
*I understand. So the purpose of your visit to Node 03 is to confirm the identity of Miss Kaori Minamiya?*

**PAFF**<br>
Yes. Revisiting this place did indeed allow me to confirm some of my memories as Kaori. However, this doesn't seem to solve the other mystery about my body, all the weird phenomenons I'm experiencing nowadays... If we continue to delve deeper, we might have to get involved with the underground society, so we don't really know how to continue our investigation either...

**[Nora]**<br>
*Underground society, is it...?*

**PAFF**<br>
Ah... I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Y, yeah! Aroma\-chan is still very confused now, right? Things have been very hard for her. She used to be such an amazing singer, but recently a lot of unlucky things have happened to her...

**[Nora]**<br>
*No, Kyuu Hou Kai is indeed not some kind of upright organization. To be honest, I have no interest in you or your stories. The reason I agreed to meet with you is simply because you have "The Eye of Horus" ability just like me. That's all there is to it.*

**PAFF**<br>
"The Eye of Horus"...? Hayato mentioned that name too. What is it exactly...?

**[Nora]**<br>
*You've experienced it personally, so I won't explain it too much. Just as you have experienced, this is an ability that allows you to wander around in the generally inaccessible virtual internet space "OS". It allows you to witness the "truth" this world has recorded... as well as the "chaos".*

**PAFF**<br>
...... OS......?<br>
I don't quite understand. I always thought that those were just dreams...<br>
How did I...?

**[Nora]**<br>
*Regarding the requirements to have such an ability... I believe you all know about "The Ender" virus found in the forbidden areas. My foster father... and former Chief of Kyuu Hou Kai Phoenix spent his entire life researching this virus.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*The Ender is a very peculiar nervous nano\-virus left behind by ancient human civilizations. It's capable of traveling between special signals. Ever since I was a child, I was able to survive in a virus\-infected environment. Further studies conducted by Phoenix discovered that I'm not actually "immune" to the virus. Instead, I merely "coexist" with it. This "coexistence" is also the source of this ability.*

**PAFF**<br>
Virus... but I don't remember ever going to a place with...<br>
......! I remember now! When I was kidnapped as Kaori, I think there was some kind of accident during the transport... Was it back then...?

**[Nora]**<br>
*Regardless of what actually happened, your body was definitely exposed to the virus in the forbidden areas at some point.*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
C\-Chief... Ah, no... I mean... Miss Nora...?

**[Nora]**<br>
*Just Nora is fine.*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Hehe... Nora! NEKO has a question!<br>
NEKO is a bit worried... Will this ability result in any bad effects for Aroma\-chan? Every time she uses this ability to see stuff, her nose starts bleeding!

**[Nora]**<br>
*There's nothing to hide here. Using this ability will take a toll on the user's body, without a doubt. My body is at the state it is in now precisely because I overused this ability in the past.*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*………*

*\[ROBO_Head emotion\]*

**[Nora]**<br>
*However, since there's a second known user now, there is a chance that your situation could be different from mine... Miss Minamiya seems to be quite healthy herself. From the looks of it, you aren't affected by the ability too much. *

**PAFF**<br>
... Is that so?

**[Nora]**<br>
*However, what I've noticed is that you don't seem to have the proper control over this ability right now. Even the activation and disconnection timings are  random. If you don't learn how to master it, things might get really bad if it ever goes out of control. In the worst\-case scenario, you might even be trapped inside there forever.*

**Hayato**<br>
It could be that dangerous!?

**[Nora]**<br>
*Yes. From my personal experience, every use of this ability will put a brief burden on the user both physically and mentally. Therefore, I recommend you learn how to properly control this ability first, though other dangers might also occur during the process of you learning how to use it. I can't promise anything.*

**PAFF**<br>
Miss Nora... are you willing to help me?

**[Nora]**<br>
*... I'll be frank. I'm merely suggesting this because I am curious about other users, and you provide valuable research material. In reality, it's all up to you to decide what you want to do. If you have no intention to take on the risks, I won't force you to. *

**PAFF**<br>
No. I've made my decision already, Miss Nora.<br>
Please, tell me how to control this ability.

**PAFF**<br>
I... as Aroma, I never got the feeling that I was myself. Even now, after remembering the things Kaori experienced, there are still many memories that have yet to awaken... It just feels like I'm still an empty and incomplete person.

**PAFF**<br>
And now, I'm standing right in front of the gate. All I need to do is take a step inside and I'll get the answers I seek... To me, there's no reason not to do so. 

**Nora**<br>
......

**PAFF**<br>
Besides... Way too many people have helped me get to this place. There's even an idiot who went broke just to come to 08 to find me. If I back down because of a small risk, I am doing everyone who has ever helped me a disservice.

**Hayato**<br>
... Kaori...

**[Nora]**<br>
*Please don't misunderstand. I'm teaching you how to control your ability simply because the virus research requires a stable sample. In addition, I don't want you to use it for no good reason afterward either. This ability... is a curse.*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*………*

**[Nora]**<br>
*In short, I will arrange guest rooms for the three of you. For the time being, you are all guests of Kyuu Hou Kai. I'll try my best to conduct the research and stabilize your ability using the safest methods.*

**PAFF**<br>
Understood. Thank you, Miss Nora!

**[Nora]**<br>
*... Just Nora is fine.<br>
I'll be leaving first. Take the guests to the guest room... One more thing, take ROBO back to his room as well.*

**Kyuu Hou Kai Member**<br>
Yes, Chief.

*\[Door Opens\]*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*... Help. Everyone, together...*
