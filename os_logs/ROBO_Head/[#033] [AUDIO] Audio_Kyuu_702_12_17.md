*[Call Starts]*

**[Rald]**<br>
*It's me, Miss Pauline. I have some new information I would like to share with you.*

**Nora**<br>
......

**[Rald]**<br>
*I couldn't get in contact with Mr. Jackson. The call got blocked... That's odd. I believe I haven't done anything that would offend you two to this degree...*

**[Nora]**<br>
*... You're "R", I presume? I heard about you from them, the one who sent us money out of nowhere and provided information on Kyuu Hou Kai. *

**[Rald]**<br>
*......<br>
If you don't mind, can you be so kind as to tell me which lady I'm currently talking to?*

**Nora**<br>
......

**[Rald]**<br>
*No need to be worried. Your speculation is correct. I was the one who guided them to Kyuu Hou Kai. You can view me as their comrade... In other words, not your enemy.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*... I'm Nora, the chief of Kyuu Hou Kai.*

**[Rald]**<br>
*Nora, "the ninth child" in the secret language... Excuse me, but you and the rumored "Eye of Horus"...*

**[Nora]**<br>
*No comment, "R"... Mr. Neumann.*

**[Rald]**<br>
*... \*Chuckles\* Looks like my identity is not exactly a secret to you either. I'm very impressed... Very well then; let's stop beating around the bush and have an open conversation, Miss Nora.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*Apologies. Right now, I... don't have the time to chit\-chat with you.*

**[Rald]**<br>
*What a shame. The science research organization of gangs that only exist in legends, safe to say I'm quite interested in you guys... Oops, getting off\-topic. I would like to speak to Mr. Jackson. He should still be there, right?*

**[Nora]**<br>
*... No, he left... I don't know where he went*

**[Rald]**<br>
*Left...? All by himself?*

**[Nora]**<br>
*... Yes.*

**[Rald]**<br>
*May I ask... did something happen?<br>
Now that I think about it, this number is supposed to belong to Miss Pauline... yet you're the one talking to me now.*

**Nora**<br>
......<br>
She's...

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

**[Rald]**<br>
*......<br>
... Is that so...*

**[Nora]**<br>
*... I am very sorry.*

**[Rald]**<br>
*Rather than sorry, I'm surprised, more than anything.<br>
Based on my understanding, Kyuu Hou Kai has practically transformed these past few years. Regular attacks barely even tickle you guys. Never thought the situation will end up like this...*

**[Nora]**<br>
*......*

**[Rald]**<br>
*However, my guess is that you're the one who's the most surprised about this.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*I'm sorry. With the level of understanding between us, I don't think I have any other information I can provide to you.*

**[Rald]**<br>
*I understand. Then allow me to present some of my information. Listen closely. Based on the description you said, the darkness you face is enough to conceal all light... Not something a few puny gangs can control, but a shadow that's much deeper and heavier...*

**[Nora]**<br>
*... You know something?*

**[Rald]**<br>
*Yes, but before that, I would like to hear your opinion. Rest assured, I'm not trying to set you up. I just don't want to waste each other's time sharing information we both already know.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*... I have some thoughts on the matter. I previously planned to tell Mr. Jackson about it... I believe that besides Diego, there's another force involved in this string of attacks.*

**[Rald]**<br>
*Hoho...?*

**[Nora]**<br>
*The enemy's skills were simply brilliant. The attacks were very well\-organized, and their understanding of Kyuu Hou Kai's defense mechanisms was also far beyond what I expected. They had everything covered, no loose ends... Diego's thugs are not capable of these things. I am absolutely certain about that.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*As a science researcher, guessing based on instinct is a careless approach. Despite that, all the signs in this incident have forced me down this path of thinking.<br>
Mr. Neumann, you mentioned a "shadow". What are you referring to?*

**[Rald]**<br>
*......*

**[Nora]**<br>
*Mr. Neumann?*

**[Rald]**<br>
*... You couldn't make a definitive decision because you don't have enough information. You couldn't deduce the motive and purpose of the attacker. The devastating destruction of Kyuu Hou Kai, the death of Miss Pauline and many other staff members... You couldn't find the connection between all of them.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*... I won't deny that.*

**[Rald]**<br>
*However, Miss Nora... try reversing your way of thinking. The drones, the blackout, the massive and noisy attack on Kyuu Hou Kai; if all of this is just to achieve a single objective...*

**[Nora]**<br>
*Stop dodging the answer. I've already provided you all the information I know.*

**[Rald]**<br>
*Ah, pardon me for my manners. Speaking in circles is a bad habit of mine...<br>
Indeed, I do have a bit of an idea on who's the mastermind behind all this, but it's still just one of many possibilities after all. I don't want to raise your hopes up too high either. All I can give you, is one name... Ivy.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*......!?<br>
Ivy... who is that?*

**[Rald]**<br>
*Do you know anything about the massive internet terrorist attack incident that occurred at the start of the year? Æsir, please try to investigate in this direction.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*So you're not entirely sure yourself as well... ?*

**[Rald]**<br>
*Yes. That's why I said I don't want to raise your hopes up too high. I still require more investigation to verify my speculations. Nonetheless, I believe that once the many strings of melody overlay with one another, the symphony known as "the truth" shall be revealed to the public...<br>
\*Chuckles\* I earnestly look forward to the arrival of that day.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*... Understood. I will view you as a person on our side, for now, and take part in your investigation.*

**[Rald]**<br>
*I am very glad to hear that from you, Miss Nora.<br>
Then, let us stay in contact.*

*[Call Ends]*

**Nora**<br>
