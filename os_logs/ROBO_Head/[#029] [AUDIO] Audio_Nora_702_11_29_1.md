Chief... I tried to stop them...

**[Nora]**<br>
*... Fellow guests, the reception room is not here. Please come with me.*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Woah! Where did you pop out all of a sudden... Little girl, who are you?

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*This unit, detects question from Miss NEKO.<br>
Answer: This is Nora.*

*\[ROBO_Head emotion\]*

**[Nora]**<br>
*... Quiet.*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*………*

*\[ROBO_Head emotion\]*

**[Nora]**<br>
*I am Nora, Chief of Kyuu Hou Kai. This is the first... No, I believe I've met two of you in the past already.*

**Hayato**<br>
!? I didn't recognize you at first. You're the one...

**[Nora]**<br>
*It has been a long time, Hayato Kusu.<br>
It seems that you've found the person you were looking for.*

**Hayato**<br>
It's all thanks to you... However, I didn't realize that you're the Chief now. On top of that...

**[Nora]**<br>
*......<br>
And this is Miss Kaori Minamiya, I presume?*

**PAFF**<br>
Umm, yes... Have we met before...?

**[Nora]**<br>
*I've met you several times in "that" place, although the meeting just now was the first time you ever responded to my calls. Your appearance... I see that a lot has happened to you since then as well.*

**PAFF**<br>
This voice... so that really was you just now.

**[Nora]**<br>
*Yes.<br>
Everyone, please come with me first.*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*This unit, will go as well.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*You stay here.*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*......*

*\[ROBO_Head emotion\]*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Umm, Ropohead and we kinda know each other. We've performed together in Node 08! Me thinks it's alright for him to tag along!

**[Nora]**<br>
*... You've met them before?*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Affirmative.<br>
These two, made music with this unit, performed with this unit.*

**Nora**<br>
......

**PAFF**<br>
Miss Nora... it's alright.

**[Nora]**<br>
*... Very well.*
