Chief, what are we gonna do with this?

*\[Knocking on metal\]*

**[Nora]**<br>
*... Stop it.*

**Kyuu Hou Kai Member**<br>
Chief! This thing trespassed into our territory! Who knows what it's gonna do next?

**[Nora]**<br>
*Enough. All of you, get out. Call Daigo. Tell him to come here.*

**Kyuu Hou Kai Member**<br>
... Yes, Chief.

*\[Door Opens\]*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*……Nora……*

**[Nora]**<br>
Why did you come back?

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*……*

**[Nora]**<br>
*I even wrote it into your supreme command. So you overwrote it...?*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Nora's eyes...?*

**[Nora]**<br>
*Can't use them anymore.*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*......<br>
Nora, was hurt by someone?*

**[Nora]**<br>
*I made a promise with Mogura. <br>
You're forbidden to ever set foot again in Node 03.*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*......*

**[Nora]**<br>
*Leave, now.*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*......!?*

**[Nora]**<br>
*......?<br>
Command mode.<br>
Leave Node 03 now, effective immediately.*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>

**Nora**<br>

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Nora, this unit...*

**[Nora]**<br>
*[Nora]. Peform system shutdown.*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*......*

**[Nora]**<br>
*Did you overwrite the entire command priority sequence...?*

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Member D**<br>
Chief... Huh!?<br>
ROBO\_Head Unit 02!? Why is it here...

**[Nora]**<br>
*No other way to do it then. Daigo, pulse pistol, shoot him.*

**Member D**<br>
......!?<br>
Understood.

*\[Pulse Pistol shot\]*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*......!!<br>
No...... rarara......*

**[Nora]**<br>
*Take him outside.*

**Member D**<br>
... Yes, Chief.

*\[Metal dragging sounds\]*

**[Nora]**<br>
*Leave, and don't come back again. If the Mogura people see you out there, it will be your end.*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*......*

**[Nora]**<br>
*If you don't leave, I will destroy you myself.*
