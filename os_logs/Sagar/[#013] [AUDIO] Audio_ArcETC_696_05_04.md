**Bruno**<br>
Are you Sagar? I'm Bruno, from class B. We're on the same unit for the United Mission this time around.

**Sagar**<br>
Oh, got it. Let's do this.

**Bruno**<br>
Huh? Your performance is stellar even in our class. How about you do all the work? Haha.

**Sagar**<br>
It's not like that. Speaking of which, this mission will be carried out in teams of 3. Our other member is...

**Alex**<br>
Found you, Bambi!!

**Sagar**<br>
... No frigging way...

*\[Hurried footsteps\]*

**Alex**<br>
Found you! We're gonna see who's boss once and for all!

**Sagar**<br>
This guy, shouldn't the training officer have split us into different units?

**Alex**<br>
Oh, come on! I planned on tearing through the rest of those weaklings to get to you. This is fate, man! Bring it on!

**Bruno**<br>
... Sagar, you know Jackal from before?

**Sagar**<br>
Coincidence, that's all... aigh.<br>
Hey, you wanna fight? Wait 'till the mission's over.

**Alex**<br>
Ha? You think you can tell the boss to wait?

**Sagar**<br>
Trainees who don't through mission training get forcibly removed from the team. I know you don't care, but I can't leave now... Plus, we don't want to drag Bruno into this.

**Alex**<br>
Eh? Someone else is here? Who're you?

**Bruno**<br>
... Let's check out the mission synopsis.

*\[Opens file\]*

**Sagar**<br>
"Locate the only Model G\-5 Mech Beast in area 3 and recover its core chip"... Model G\-5 Mech Beast?

**Bruno**<br>
You don't remember? The training officer told us about this... Jackal?

**Alex**<br>
Huh? I don't pay attention to that meaningless crap.

**Bruno**<br>
... Listen. These mech beasts were developed by A.R.C. based on creatures from the old generation. Besides simulating the habits of wild beasts, weapons were added for training purposes.

**Sagar**<br>
Umm, so far it's still stuff I remember...

**Bruno**<br>
The Model G\-5 is based on a four\-legged creature called a "giraffe". Its defining characteristic is a neck that's several meters long. They use it to feed on high\-resting leaves. Although they are naturally gentle creatures...

**Alex**<br>
Vegetarian? Isn't that the perfect prey for a Jackal?

*\[Footsteps\]*

**Sagar**<br>
Hey, where you going?

**Alex**<br>
Duh, I'm going to crush that mech beast!

**Bruno**<br>
Wait a sec, this is a United Mission, with only one guy...

**Sagar**<br>
Forget it. Don't stop him. There's no way we can cooperate with him.

**Alex**<br>
Sagar?

**Sagar**<br>
Hey, since you so eagerly want to see whose on top... let's make this a competition. First one to get the chip wins. There's only one mech beast, right?

**Alex**<br>
This? A competition? Sounds pretty boring...

**Sagar**<br>
... This is one of the official exploration team missions. Or are you saying you don't think you can do it? Afraid you're gonna lose to poor, little Bambi?

**Alex**<br>
Ha, Ha, HAHAHAHA!!<br>
There's no way I'm losing!!!

*\[Hurried footsteps\]*

**Bruno**<br>
... You guys are a pain in the a\*\*. I just wanna complete this mission smoothly...

**Sagar**<br>
Sorry... Regardless of who gets the chip, you'll pass the session. Won't be an issue.

**Bruno**<br>
Is it that easy? The training officer didn't seem to think so...

**Sagar**<br>
If you're worried, than help me out, future officer Bruno. There's no way I'm losing to that guy!
