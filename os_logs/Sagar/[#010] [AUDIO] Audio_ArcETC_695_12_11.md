**Sagar**<br>
... Alright, you got me. What's the deal?

**Trainee H**<br>
Just wanna chit chat, Sagar, that's all. You've been rather cocky recently.

**Trainee P**<br>
Champion of the comprehensive physical ability test 3 times in a row? Breaking the record of long\-distance running that's existed for 100 years? Knocking down 10 people in combat class? This is ridiculous, what's meds you on?

**Sagar**<br>
How would I do that? They'd find it in the medical tests.

**Trainee L**<br>
Already checked. You are an absolute beast, even your brain is full of muscles... Hehe, except your height is...

**Trainees**<br>
HAHAHAHAHA......

**Sagar**<br>
You guys got me here just to mock me?

**Trainee H**<br>
No, we want to make a deal.

**Sagar**<br>
A deal?

**Trainee H**<br>
You know as well as I do that they're just looking for the top guy. The higher\-ups already noticed you early on. Ordinary people like us don't stand out easily.

**Trainee P**<br>
Being trained like a dog every day, being forced to drop out of the team after a few years...... <br>
We don't want that, so we wanna ask you for a favor. 

**Sagar**<br>
You want me to go easy on you guys during the exam?

**Trainee L**<br>
Hey, hey, hey. That's not what I said. Isn't it nice to let others shine once in a while?<br>
It's good for all of us.

**Sagar**<br>
I really respect the rules here, I think that there's a chance for everyone if you all work hard. Besides, mutual benefit? I am not hearing anything that's beneficial to me.

**Trainee H**<br>
Hey... if we cooperate, us three won't accidentally break your hand, does that count as a benefit?

*\[Footsteps \]*

**Sagar**<br>
Let me remind you guys, it's prohibited for trainees to fight in private...

**Trainee H**<br>
Oh, afraid? Aren't you the son of the illustrious Luka?<br>
Shaming daddy like this......

**Sagar**<br>
... Just as expected, it's because of my dad... alright.

*\[Objects Crashing\]*

**Sagar**<br>
If you wanna fight, I'm down!

**Trainee H**<br>
HA, HAHAHA, you're dead meat! Payne, Larry! Kick his a\*\*!

*\[Hurried footsteps\]*

**Sagar**<br>
Hmph!

*\[Fists \]*

**Trainee P**<br>
Holy s\*\*\*, what the f\*\*\*, he's a monster...

**Trainee H**<br>
Don't be scared! There are 3 of us! Surround him! 

*\[Blocks\]*

**Sagar**<br>
...Ugh! Damn it...

*\[Objects Crashing\]*

**Trainees**<br>
!?!?!?!?

**Alex**<br>
Enough, rookies... enough!

**Trainee H**<br>
Officer... J\-J\-Jackal?

**Alex**<br>
You know me, eh? This is my territory, why didn't you tell me this was going down?

**Sagar**<br>
......

**Trainee L**<br>
O\-Officer. we were just practicing......

**Alex**<br>
You call 3 fighting against 1 practicing? Bulls\*\*\*.<br>
Come on now, let's do 1\-on\-1. You were the most eager to get started. You go first.

**Trainee H**<br>
T\-This... if it's 1\-on\-1...

**Alex**<br>
Hurry up, how long do you want me to wait?

**Trainee H**<br>
D\-Damn it! Sagar, you just wait and see!!

*\[Hurried footsteps\]*

**Alex**<br>
Ran away. F\*\*\*ing babies. Ha, how many times have you been caught up in this type of s\*\*\*? If I weren't on here to save your a\*\*...

**Sagar**<br>
Mind your own business... I can handle them.

**Alex**<br>
Duh, if you can't take down those trashy losers, I'd kill you myself.

**Sagar**<br>
... You wanna pick a fight? Now?

**Alex**<br>
You think I'm as dumb as those morons? Start a fight here? Look up.

**Sagar**<br>
......! Cameras?

**Alex**<br>
Really depends if those old farts even care.<br>
Listen closely, for next month's United Mission, our batch will be operating with the noobs... Let's end things then once and for all. Any questions?

**Sagar**<br>
Yeah. Can you leave me alone?

**Alex**<br>
Hehe... once a Jackal's locked onto its prey, it won't let go easily... Hahaha!!

*\[Footsteps \]*

**Sagar**<br>
... F\*\*\* this...
