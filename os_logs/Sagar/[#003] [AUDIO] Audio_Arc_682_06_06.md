**A.R.C. Security guard**<br>
Wolf\-01, head back to the city!

*\[Engine stalls\]*

**A.R.C. Security guard**<br>
Colin? Where is... everyone?

**Colin**<br>
... ugh...

*\[Falls down\]*

**A.R.C. Security guard**<br>
Wah!? Medic! Hurry up!

*[→Signal Switches]*

**Colin**<br>
Ugh...

**Leo**<br>
You're awake.

**Colin**<br>
You're... ogh!

**Leo**<br>
Don't. Just lie down. This isn't a minor injury.

**Colin**<br>
......<br>
Luka... he's...

**Leo**<br>
... Sorry. We haven't received either his signal or his vital signs. We're going to send another squad to the mission location to confirm his condition.

**Colin**<br>
No... ! ... Ugh!!<br>
My mission report...! You haven't seen it!?

**Leo**<br>
We saw it. Mr. Neumann, you'll be commended for your bravery in an appropriate manner. Let us handle the next move. We think you ought to rest for a while.

**Colin**<br>
What... what are you saying? I can still take on missions. I told you I wanted to go back and settle things with him myself...

**Leo**<br>
Mr. Neumann, listen. You've got to trust us. This is best for you.

**Colin**<br>
Riya... his wife, his child. They deserve to know the truth.

**Leo**<br>
We sorry, but according to the regulations, they don't. None of us are happy about the tragedy that occurred during this mission. <br>
Professionals will deal with the losses that squad members and their families have suffered. They will get everything they need. <br>
As for the details of the mission, we cannot let any of it leak to the outside world, even if it's family. You know that.

**Colin**<br>
... What kind of s\*\*\* rule is that? Do you know what happened to us!?

**Leo**<br>
As I mentioned before, we've already collected and fully reviewed your mission report. We're very clear on what happened. However, this is Top Secret, highly confidential. It's not even going to be seen by members of the exploration team.

**Colin**<br>
What the hell... are you talking about... explain yourself... oof!

**Leo**<br>
Your body needs to rest. The doctor's already given you a dose of meds. They'll be great for your recovery and allow you to recuperate in peace.

**Colin**<br>
No... let me... outta here... zzZ...

*[»»»Fast Forward»»»]*

**A.R.C. Nurse**<br>
Mr. Neumann, time to eat.<br>
Mr. Neumann... ?

**A.R.C. Nurse**<br>
......!<br>
Mr. Neumann's gone!

**Leo**<br>

*\[Doorbell\]*

**Sagar**<br>
Coming!<br>
......? Sir, who are you looking for?

**Colin**<br>
... Sagar? You've grown so much...

**Riya**<br>
Sagar, who is it?<br>
... Colin...!? My god! Your wounds... what happened!?

**Colin**<br>
People from A.R.C.... have they come yet?

**Riya**<br>
Eh? No... what, what's wrong!?

**Colin**<br>
Oh, yea...? Haha...

**Sagar**<br>
Mom...?

**Riya**<br>
Sagar, go play in your room, okay?<br>
Colin, you scared us half to death. What's going on?

**Colin**<br>
... I'm sorry... *\*sob\*... \*sob\**... sorry... Luka...

**A.R.C. Security guard**<br>
Got you! Mr. Neumann! You can't keep running! You're coming with us!

**Colin**<br>
Let... Let me go!!!

**Riya**<br>
What are you doing!? What on earth happened!? What's wrong with Luka!?

**Leo**<br>
We're sorry, Mr. Neumann's psyche hasn't stabilized. I'll come by and explain everything.

**Colin**<br>
What are you saying...!? Let me go! Don't listen to them!

**Leo**<br>
Mrs. Riya, I'm sorry to have to tell you...
