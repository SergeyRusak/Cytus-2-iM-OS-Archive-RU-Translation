**Grave Robber A**<br>
Perfect, no activity on their end. Keep moving towards the car!

**Grave Robber L**<br>
Damn...

**Grave Robber A**<br>
Lucien, I know you want to avenge your father, but you've got to be patient. We're outnumbered.

**Grave Robber L**<br>
I know...

*\[Gunshot\]*

**Grave Robber B**<br>
EAHH!!

**Grave Robber A**<br>
!?<br>
Enemy!

**Grave Robber L**<br>
F\*\*\*! Goddamn Exploration Team!

*\[Rapid Gunfire\]*

**Grave Robbers**<br>
\-WAH!!!<br>
\-OAH!!!<br>
\-AAHHH!!!

**Sagar**<br>
Got you. Don't worry, no fatal injuries.

**Grave Robber L**<br>
Ha... huff... you rat... Don't you care if your friend lives or dies!?

**Sagar**<br>
That's why I came alone. If you set off those explosives at this distance, everyone would be finished. I knew as soon as you didn't set 'em off immediately. 5 of you, 2 of us, not so good for you guys, eh?

**Grave Robber L**<br>
Haha... a betting man...? Not bad... but you made two big mistakes...<br>
Number 1——You don't know how much I want to kill you bastards. Number 2——You shouldn't have shot our legs... shoulda shot our hands!!

*\[Gunfire\]*

**Sagar**<br>
ERGHH!?

**Edwards**<br>
Sagar!!!

*\[Gunfire\]*

**Grave Robbers**<br>

**Fox - 03 Captain**<br>
This is squad Fox \- 03, reporting to HQ——mission is complete. We've successfully rescued the hostage Will. He's ingested a miniscule amount of the virus, but he's not in danger of his life. 4 grave robbers have been captured, 1 is dead. Squad Eagle \- 01 team member Sagar was hit with gunfire. He's already been treated. Captain Edwards... was hit with multiple bullets, he's seriously injured. After we get to the city we'll need to arrange medical treatment as soon as possible.

**Bruno**<br>
Captain, forgive me for changing the subject, but I noticed something strange...

**Fox - 03 Captain**<br>
... Speak.

**Bruno**<br>
These guys don't have any flares or flare guns on them. That flare that was fired... Plus, I checked behind the site and couldn't find any means of transportation. Yet the tire tracks on the ground were fresh...

**Fox - 03 Captain**<br>
Are you telling me there was more than 5?<br>
Hey robbers, where's your leader? You got somebody else? Speak!

**Grave Robber A**<br>
... F\*\*\* yourself...

**Fox - 03 Captain**<br>
Wrong answer.

*\[Punches\]*

**Grave Robber A**<br>
POAHH!!!

**Exploration Team Member**<br>
Captain, what're we gonna do with this body?

**Fox - 03 Captain**<br>
The mission was to capture the grave robbers. Just find a place and bury that piece of crap.

**Sagar**<br>
...!?<br>
That...

**Grave Robber A**<br>
Lucien...

**Fox - 03 Captain**<br>
Huh? You wanna talk?

**Grave Robber A**<br>
He's not a piece of crap... His name is Lucien... you bastard...

**Fox - 03 Captain**<br>
......<br>
Destroying the valuable remains of mankind everywhere, killing innocent people, you're all s\*\*\* to me.

**Grave Robber A**<br>
... Don't know where you heard that, we've never... killed innocent people... We need this to get by... But you... you people who live by some strange code that you decide upon... You take away our right to live... Who's the real piece of s\*\*\*?

**Sagar**<br>
......<br>


**Fox - 03 Captain**<br>
......<br>
Everyone assemble! Head back!

**Sagar**<br>
Captain, your body doing alright?

**Edwards**<br>
Don't call me that. I ain't captain anymore. You're the captain now.

**Sagar**<br>
...... I still think Alex is more suited for the job. My unruliness was what got you hurt...

**Edwards**<br>
... One month, I don't think these two legs will ever move again. But you got it all wrong. I never blamed you. Your decision brought about the best possible result, even though it came about in a messed up manner.

**Edwards**<br>
The higher\-ups wanted Alex for the job based on their assessments of various data, not to mention you going against the rules took a lot of points away from you——but they don't know what happened out there and the potential in each of you. I believe you're the better candidate. Moreover, that little runt refused immediately... Forget it, I never liked his attitude.

**Sagar**<br>
He's got a vulgar mouth, that's all. He regrets what happened the most. He's upset that he didn't do anything in the moment. But you know how he is. He won't come and apologize.

**Edwards**<br>
Is that so? I didn't know you thought so highly of him.

**Sagar**<br>
Alex told me——he used to have a friend from childhood. They started doing underground fighting together and his friend ended up getting beaten to death. I'm sure he got upset back there because that hit too close to home.

**Edwards**<br>
Hehe... Didn't think that was the kind of guy with a backstory. Anything else? You didn't come here to praise Alex.

**Sagar**<br>
......<br>
Actually... there's something I wanted to ask you. That robber we killed... I don't know how to face that situation. Strictly speaking, it was I who killed him. I never thought that what my father did was this heavy. I mean, having to decide whether someone lives or dies... That guy... didn't even get so much as a gravestone. Grave robbers——are they really so bad that they ought to be treated like that?

**Edwards**<br>
...... Your father was an outstanding explorer. You could even say he's my spiritual leader. The most enlightening thing he ever gave me was——even if someone's power isn't enough to change or improve holes in the system, you've still got to do what you think is right in a mistaken environment. One day, little by little, the world will change.

**Sagar**<br>
......!

**Edwards**<br>
You're a lot like him...<br>
Indeed, even if you've got greater abilities, I don't believe anyone has the right to determine whether one lives or dies. But as you saw, not everyone thinks like this. People get consumed by power, excessively worshipping their own faith, causing their values to get swallowed up... I believe that you're just like Luka and won't become like that. But do you believe?<br>


**Sagar**<br>
......

**Edwards**<br>
It'll take time, but think that over. Sagar, you possess the ability to see people clearly, sharp instincts, and incredible luck. Add to that Bruno's observational skills and Alex's undeniable strength. I can already see that you'll cultivate my Eagle \- 01 to an even more vigorous state. In any case, do it well. To get an opportunity like this, don't fail to live up to the expectations of the Exploration Team, or the honor of your father.

**Sagar**<br>
... Yes, sir! Thank you, sir. These words... I'll remember them well.
