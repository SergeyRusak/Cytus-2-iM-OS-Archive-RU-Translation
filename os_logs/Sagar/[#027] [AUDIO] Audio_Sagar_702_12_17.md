**Luka**<br>
Colin! On the left!

*\[Consecutive Gunshots\]*

**Colin**<br>
Hee... Huff... What are these things? How many are there!?

**Luka**<br>
Colin, listen. I'll cover you. When I fire, you head to the exit and retreat. Do not stop.

**Colin**<br>
What the hell you talking about? Cut the s\*\*\*...

**Luka**<br>
Colin! That's an order!

**Colin**<br>
......

**Luka**<br>
We've still got brothers trapped down there...

**Colin**<br>
Didn't I tell you...

**Luka**<br>
I'm going back.

**Colin**<br>
They're dead!! Luka! We're the only two left! We've got to live!

**Luka**<br>
......

**Colin**<br>
You wanna be the hero, huh? Well I ain't giving you a chance to steal the limelight, brother.<br>
Listen, we'll take turns providing cover and slowly head towards the exit. We can do it!

**Luka**<br>
......<br>
... Fine. Who's first?

**Colin**<br>
It's my plan. Obviously, I'm first.

**Luka**<br>
Alright... One clip, then switch to me. That rock over there will be our first cover, got it?

**Colin**<br>
Got it, 3——2——1!

Great, now you! Can you get to that column from your position?

**Colin**<br>
Hmph. Just watch me.

**Luka**<br>
3——2——1!

**Colin**<br>
Luka!! You screwing with me!?

*\[Consecutive Gunshots\]*

**Luka**<br>
If we keep this up we're both gonna die down here! That's the cold, hard truth!

**Colin**<br>
Mothaf\*\*\*er! You don't trust me!?

**Luka**<br>
I believe you can do this; you're the only one who can report back everything that happened here.

*\[Consecutive Gunshots\]*

**Luka**<br>
This geographical formation will keep them at bay for a while, now get going! I'll pull through! Leave a vehicle for me!

**Colin**<br>
Oh...

**Luka**<br>
What's the matter!? How about you give me some trust!

**Colin**<br>
Damn... If you don't come back, I'm coming right back to beat your a\*\*! You hear me!?

**Luka**<br>
You got it! See you in the city!
