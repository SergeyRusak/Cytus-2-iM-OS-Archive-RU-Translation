*...\*yawn\*...*

**Sagar**<br>
Jackal, focus. You wanna be scolded?

**Alex**<br>
What's the big deal? Can't a guy yawn? That old fart isn't around anyway.

**Edwards**<br>
Who's not around?

**Alex**<br>
WAH!! Captain!

**Sagar**<br>
Captain!

**Edwards**<br>
ATTEN\-HUT! Everybody up! <br>
Alex, gimme 100, then tell me who's not here.

**Alex**<br>
Oh... 1, 2, 3, 4...

**Edwards**<br>
Everybody listen up. This time around we're headed to the southside of N501\-423 to capture some grave robbers. Based on the patrol squad's reports, looks like there're other humans destroying and robbing the local sites.

**Edwards**<br>
You 3 new guys, listen up. You got to keep up and move with the squad. This'll be your first mission where you'll be battling with humans. Your identity here is as a trainee. I'm letting you participate for those purposes, so be cautious and aware out there. You got it?

**Alex**<br>
Hey, hey... Finally...?

**Edwards**<br>
Alex, who gave you permission to speak? Another hundred.

**Alex**<br>
Oh...

**Edwards**<br>
The report's in your database. I'm giving you 20 minutes to look it over and discuss it openly. If you've got any questions, don't hesitate to ask. We're heading out in an hour.

**Exploration Team Members**<br>
YES, SIR!

*[→File Switches]*

*\[Binoculars\]*

**Edwards**<br>
The target is 100 meters ahead. Squad Fox \- 03 is currently gathering intel. Our job is to carry out the capture. In a moment, you three are gonna follow me closely. I hope that through this mission you can pick up a lot of useful info.

**Sagar、Alex、Bruno**<br>
Yes, sir!

**[Fox - 03 Captain]**<br>
*Fox \- 03 reporting to Eagle \- 01, a scan's revealed 5 targets. All are adult males, identity unknown. All are armed with guns and explosives. Models unknown. Looks like the weapons were self\-made.*

**Edwards**<br>
Copy, squad Eagle \- 01 received. Fox, hold position. Eagle get ready for action. Capture is our primary goal, but depending on their firepower, a firefight is allowed.

**Squad Member**<br>
Yes, sir!

*[→File Switches]*

**Edwards**<br>
Damn! Only one?

**Fox - 03 Captain**<br>
Yes, it's Will. Sorry! We shouldn't have made this mistake...

**Edwards**<br>
Think it over when we get back. Right now, our first objective is to save the hostage.

**Fox - 03 Captain**<br>
They broke Will's mask... If we want to get him out safely, we'll need to wait until they've all left. Otherwise, the explosives on his body will explode.

**Edwards**<br>
They're not to be messed with... Looks like we won't be able to capture them. The safety of our team is top priority.

**Fox - 03 Captain**<br>
... Edwards, I don't think we should compromise with terrorists. Will is prepared to face whatever happens.

**Edwards**<br>
The safety of our team is top priority. In this mission, my rank is higher than yours. I won't repeat it a third time.

**Fox - 03 Captain**<br>
... Let me remind you, it's not the time for personal matters...

**Alex**<br>
Hey, hey, no time for this stuff, right? If we keep this up, they're all going to get away and our brother is going to die.

**Exploration Team Member**<br>
Hey noob, not your turn to speak.

**Sagar**<br>
I think he's right; perhaps we can catch them without sacrificing our brother.

**Fox - 03 Captain**<br>
......?<br>
There's something wrong with your new recruits?

**Edwards**<br>
... Let him speak.

*[»»»Fast Forward»»»]*

**Edwards**<br>
No way. Too dangerous.

**Sagar**<br>
Captain, trust me. With my physique and speed, I can do this! If the whole team goes in, it'll only startle them. We don't know the range of their explosives. It might cause even more damage!

**Edwards**<br>
Even if you can sneak behind the enemy, to take out 5  grave robbers armed to the teeth...

**Alex**<br>
Why not give him a gun?

**Edwards**<br>
What'd you say!? Letting a trainee carry a gun...

*\[Flare gun fired\]*

**Exploration Team Member**<br>
!!!<br>
That was the grave robbers... They're starting to retreat!

**Alex**<br>
We've no time! Do you want to save our guy or what!?

*\[Bodies Collide\]*

**Edwards**<br>
Watch your tone! I grew up with Will! Ain't nobody here that wants to save him more than me!

**Alex**<br>
......!<br>
Then quit talking and do something! Letting us trainees experience a dangerous mission is your responsibility!

*\[Draws Gun\]*

**Sagar**<br>
I'm heading out! When I get back, punish me according to the rules!

*\[Sprints\]*

**Edwards**<br>
Sagar!!!
