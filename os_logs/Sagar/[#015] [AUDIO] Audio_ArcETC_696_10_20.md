**[Edwards]**<br>
*... Above is the list of all those who've been selected as reserve members of the exploration team. You'll all be put under the supervision of different training officers and put through an even more rigorous training period. You'll be put through the ringer, and breakthough whatever limits you thought you had.*

**[Edwards]**<br>
*Whatever your rank, whatever your background, you are one step closer to officially joining the team. Just remember one thing. Continue to train your a\*\*es off.*

**Trainees**<br>
YES, SIR!!!

*[»»»Fast Forward»»»]*

**Trainee L**<br>
Hank, congrats on becoming a reserve member!

**Trainee H**<br>
Hey now, I told you Officer Dennis has a good eye for talent.

**Trainee P**<br>
Dude, speaking of which, Sagar... got picked by Captain Edwards.

**Trainee H**<br>
Poor bastard. Edwards' methods are notoriously brutal. Even Sagar might not be able to handle it.

**Trainee P**<br>
Also means he's proven himself to be a monster...

**Trainee H**<br>
Huh? What'd you say?

**Trainee P**<br>
N\-Nothing! Didn't say anything!

**Trainee H**<br>
Hmph. How dumb are you? Captain Edwards has an uncle named Jake Edwards. Was a member of Wolf\-01. And Sagar, well he's Luka's son...

**Trainee L**<br>
Oh... Jake Edwards was a member of Luka's team!

**Trainee H**<br>
See. If this isn't nepotism then I don't know what is! Did you see his written exam scores? You think that's what turned Edwards onto him?

**Trainee P**<br>
Oh, yea... you're right, bro!

**Alex、Bruno**<br>
......

*[→Signal Switches]*

**Alex**<br>
Yo, Bambi, Big B. There you are.

**Sagar**<br>
......

**Bruno**<br>
Jackal, didn't see you all afternoon... You skipping class again?

**Alex**<br>
What, no good mommy? Just handling some personal business... You know, like grabbing this can of beer.

*\[Opens beer\]*

**Bruno**<br>
Yo, if you get caught...

**Alex**<br>
I'll finish it right up. Won't be a problem.<br>
Or, I could just do this...<br>


**Sagar**<br>
Hey! What're you doing!

**Alex**<br>
... Just pouring it on depressed, little Bambi's head.<br>
Just looking at your sad, s\*\*\* eating face gets me down.

**Sagar**<br>
... Sorry.

**Bruno**<br>
What, those rumors? About your dad?

**Sagar**<br>
......<br>
I know that stuff shouldn't get to me... But it doesn't matter if it's me or my dad. Those guys don't understand anything...

**Bruno**<br>
... Sagar. We've all see how hard you work. Even your written exam. Didn't you get an A\- this time? Not far off from my A+.

**Sagar**<br>
... That's not much of a consolation...

**Bruno**<br>
Haha.. whatever. Forget those fools. You're something special. It's got nothing to do with who your dad was. Am I right? Are you trying to get to the top, or what?

**Sagar**<br>
... Yeah... got it.

**Alex**<br>
Big B, you sound like those folks from the counseling department. Gross

**Bruno**<br>
Oh yeah? Hmm, maybe I'll do that when I retire. After all, some stupid, ignorant battle maniac is going to need long\-term counseling from all that brain damage.

**Alex**<br>
HEY!? YOU TALKIN' BOUT ME!? Piece of...

**Sagar**<br>
Haha... Didn't mean to worry you guys.

**Alex**<br>
... Don't drag me into this.<br>
Oh, yeah. The firearms instructor is looking for you, Bambi. Think he wants you to organize the ammunition depot.

**Sagar**<br>
Alright, I'll go find him. Thanks for giving me the heads up, Jackal.

**Alex**<br>
Get the hell out of here.

*\[Door opens\]*

**Bruno**<br>
Gone? Alright... Jackal, tell me what's going on.

*\[Projection\]*

**Bruno**<br>
Why were Hank, Payne, and Larry shoved into the food waste barrel at the dump?

**Alex**<br>
Told ya I was handling personal business. Got a problem?

**Bruno**<br>
...*\*sigh\**...<br>
Just this time, I don't know anything.

**Alex**<br>
Hehe, you want in?

**Bruno**<br>
... No.
