**Alex**<br>
Shrimp... Shrimp...

**Bruno**<br>
Jackal, what's the matter? You won't eat shrimp?

**Alex**<br>
You know those are insects, right...?

**Sagar**<br>
Hey, pull yourself together and finish it, alright? You'll get yelled at for sharing your food or leaving any on your plate.

**Alex**<br>
Ugh... I think I'm gonna throw up...

*\[Plate Smashes\]*

**Alex**<br>
Oh? What's going on, bruh? There a fight or something?

**Lucy**<br>
… Sorry.

**Trainee A**<br>
Ah… Don't worry 'bout it, hehe...

**Instructor**<br>
What the hell are you all doing?

**Lucy**<br>
I accidentally knocked down his plate, sorry.

**Instructor**<br>
Clean it up.

**Bruno**<br>
……?

*[→File Switches]*

*\[Punch Combo\]*

**Lucy**<br>
Hoo...! Hah!

**Sagar**<br>
…… Her again.<br>
It's……Lucy, right? Independent training? Little late.

**Lucy**<br>
Yeah... I wanna pull my grades up.

**Sagar**<br>
I heard your number one aspiration is to get on squad Eagle \- 01. No wonder you're so interested in us. May I ask why?

**Lucy**<br>
... Eagle \- 01 is the field suqad with the most outstanding performance.

**Sagar**<br>
Ah, that's according to previous scores, ever since...

**Lucy**<br>
Sir, can you practice with me?

**Sagar**<br>
Eh? Uh, sure.

*[»»»Fast Forward»»»]*

**Sagar**<br>
Alright...let's begin.

*\[Punches\]*

**Sagar**<br>
Yeah, that's right. You'll be scored on your reactions for the test as well. When you're striking, keep your eye on both of my hands. If possible, try not to close your eyes. That'll help.

*\[Punches\]*

**Sagar**<br>
Not bad. Try switching to mid\-lower section attacks. That way the examiner will have a harder time getting a hold of your striking patterns. That'll get you higher scores.

**Lucy**<br>
Like this?

*\[Fist\]*

**Sagar**<br>
......!?

*\[Blocks\]*

**Lucy**<br>
......Uf!?

**Sagar**<br>
Glass...pieces of glass? Hey, you...

**Instructor**<br>
Hey! What the hell are you two doing? Time for lights out!

**Sagar**<br>
Wah!? Sorry, we'll get back to the dorms immediately!

*[→Signal Switches]*

**Sagar**<br>
......

**Bruno**<br>
Sagar, where'd you run off to?

**Sagar**<br>
Eh...? Just out for a walk. Walked a little far, that's all. Haha...

**Bruno**<br>
......<br>
That trainee from the cafeteria... I saw you two together.

**Sagar**<br>
Uh... Yeah, I was helping her train a bit.

**Bruno**<br>
You better watch out for her. When she knocked over that plate, didn't look like an accident.

**Sagar**<br>
......

**Bruno**<br>
Sagar...?

**Sagar**<br>
Eh? Ah, you're overthinking things. She seems normal to me.

*[Signal Lost]*
