**Sagar**<br>
Hello?

**[Riya]**<br>
*Sagar, are you coming home?*

**Sagar**<br>
Yea, just got off work.

**[Riya]**<br>
*Get some milk and soy cauce from the market.*

**Sagar**<br>
Oh, okay.

**[Riya]**<br>
*Low fat! You always get it wrong, dummy.*

**Sagar**<br>
When are you gonna stop calling me that...? Got it, see ya.

*[Call ends]*

**????**<br>
Hey.

**Sagar**<br>
?

*\[Fist\]*

**Sagar**<br>
!?

*\[Wall breaks\]*

**Sagar**<br>
What are you doing!?

**????**<br>
You don't recognize me?

**Sagar**<br>
......?<br>
No, who are you?

**????**<br>
I'm Alex, otherwise known as Jackal. This'll jog your memory, Bambi?

**Sagar**<br>
!!<br>
From the UFZ... whatta you want?

**Alex**<br>
You move up in the ranks and you can face the champion, me. Why'd you disappeared like that? Scared?

**Sagar**<br>
... I quit fighting.

**Alex**<br>
Why not? I heard you didn't even take the cash prize. You crazy?

**Sagar**<br>
... I wouldn't take that money. I know that money isn't all made from the UFZ. That's dirty money.

**Alex**<br>
Ha...? I don't know what you're talking about. Whatever, I'm not here to talk with you about money. Since you won't face me on stage, then we'll just have to do it here!

*\[Fist\]*

**Sagar**<br>
!!!!

*\[Fist\]*

*\[Block\]*

**Sagar**<br>
Cut it out! I don't wanna fight with you!

**Alex**<br>
HA! Then quit hiding and stop me!

**Sagar**<br>
... If you insist.

*[»»»Fast Forward»»»]*

**Alex**<br>
*\*cough\**... ahh! Ha... ha...<br>
F\*\*\*...

**Sagar**<br>
*\*breathes heavily\**... Hey, enough already? You're tough, but the outcome's clear.

**Alex**<br>
Shut... up... ugh...

**Sagar**<br>
You alright...?

**Alex**<br>
Don't touch me!<br>
It was so f\*\*\*ing hard to climb to the top... How could I lose to some street scum like you...

**Sagar**<br>
Tch... Didn't know it was that important to you, sorry. Forget about it. I'm not in those circles, anyway. I'm not fighting anymore. What doesn't hurt you makes you stronger.

**Alex**<br>
... What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.

**Sagar**<br>
Oh, is that it?

**Alex**<br>
F\*\*\*! I don't give a s\*\*\*! I hate it when there's someone stronger than me!

**Sagar**<br>
... Tsk, can't help you there. But I've got a life to live. If you keep harassing me like this, I'm really gonna be in a pickle.

**Alex**<br>
With skills like that, why aren't you fighting? You didn't even take the money. What's wrong with you?<br>
... Where'd you learn to fight?<br>


**Sagar**<br>
My dad used to be on the Exploration Team, so I guess it's whatever style they use. I happened upon your scene 'cuz I'm saving money to join the squad. When I found out what was really going on I lost interest. Simple as that.

**Alex**<br>
Exploration team? Hehe, you mean those guys who are thrown outside of the city walls to die for nothing? Ain't nothing fun about that...

*\[Fist\]*

**Alex**<br>
Ugh!?<br>
Didn't you say you didn't want to fight!? Ha... forget it, I lose. If you're this crazy, you're dad must be a beast?

**Sagar**<br>
He's dead.

**Alex**<br>
......

**Sagar**<br>
... All I can say is that if you continue on trying to be the "strongest guy", you're gonna end up a nobody. You have no idea what kind of things the exploration team sees out there. I'll bet you pick any member of the elite squad and they could take on both of us, no problem.

**Alex**<br>
......!

**Sagar**<br>
... What am I doing talking to you about this? Stop bothering me or I'm notifying the Administration Bureau. See ya.

*\[Footsteps\]*

**Alex**<br>
Hey, were you serious?

**Sagar**<br>
Ha? Cut the crap! You attacked me on the street, who am I supposed to call?

**Alex**<br>
No, not that. I mean the Exploration Team. Are the guys in there really that tough?

**Sagar**<br>
... Compared to you, absolutely.

*\[Footsteps\]*

**Alex**<br>
