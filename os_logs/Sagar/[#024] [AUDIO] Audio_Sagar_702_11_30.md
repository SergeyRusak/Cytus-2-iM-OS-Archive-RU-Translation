This is channel 107.83, Captain Sagar...

**[Rin]**<br>
*Sagar? It's me...*<br>


**Sagar**<br>
Rin! What a coincidence. I wanted to get in contact with you! I found a new plant. The shape of the leaf is like a crescent moon. It's got purple, reddish fruits...

**[Rin]**<br>
*That, that...*

**Sagar**<br>
... Sorry, are... are you feeling alright?

**[Rin]**<br>
*Not really... Sagar, there's something... I wanna talk with you about.*

**Sagar**<br>
... Is it the outside connection you mentioned last time?

**[Rin]**<br>
*... Yeah.*

**Sagar**<br>
Got it... let's hear it.

*[»»»Fast Forward»»»]*

**Sagar**<br>
So, that person called you out of nowhere?

**[Rin]**<br>
*Yeah, but it was different this time. While I was analyzing some data, I was pulled into the connection all of the sudden.... I don't know what to do. I didn't even get off one sentence...*

**Sagar**<br>
They just signed off? You didn't say anything?

**[Rin]**<br>
*Uh... Umm, yeah...*

**Sagar**<br>
......<br>
Doesn't make sense...

**[Rin]**<br>
*I\-I don't know...*

**Sagar**<br>
... In any case, I think you're right to not respond. If they have enough power to forcibly pull you in, it may be dangerous to speak. Whoever it is, they may be trying to use you to get deep into A.R.C.'s system.

**[Rin]**<br>
*Ah, I checked. Nothing's been implanted.<br>
... Perhaps they're not out to cause harm...*

**Sagar**<br>
Let's hope that's the case. Don't forget your current situation is far from a safe one. If the higher\-ups find out about this... You best be extremely careful.

**[Rin]**<br>
*I... I understand.*

**Sagar**<br>
Sorry. I'm... Right now, you're going to need to continue to help them.<br>
I still don't have a way to get you free.

**[Rin]**<br>
*Don't say that... You've already done so much for me.*

**Sagar**<br>
Not enough.<br>
Didn't I make you a promise? One day...

**[Rin]**<br>
*... Leave this place, live a normal life...<br>
... Is that... really possible?*

**Sagar**<br>
Of course! I just need to keep working hard, make valuable contributions as captain of Eagle\-01, and earn everyone's trust. The higher\-ups will definitely understand when I explain it to them...

**[Rin]**<br>
*But... like this, I...*

**Sagar**<br>
Don't worry. I'll stay by your side. If you're afraid of 08 or A.R.C., we can go wherever you want... And if you're lucky, maybe you'll be able to remember some things from your past.

**[Rin]**<br>
*... Okay... thanks so much, Sagar.<br>
I'm so lucky to have been found by you.*

**Sagar**<br>
Alright, alright. Quit thanking me already.<br>
Didn't I tell you? I'll protect you, I promise.

**[Rin]**<br>
*......<br>
Yeah. How's the mission going? The Dr. , he...*

**Sagar**<br>
It's going well. The informant is willing to cooperate. We've basically locked in on his location. Next, we're gonna head into the forbidden areas on foot to locate him.

**[Rin]**<br>
*On foot? Aren't you scared of being found?*

**Sagar**<br>
You got it. He's a very keen fellow. This time around we can't ride in on a helicopter. Otherwise, he must disappear in an instant.

**[Rin]**<br>
*...I hope it doesn't come to a confrontation.*

**Sagar**<br>
I don't have much hope, since it's that guy we're talking about.<br>
If possible, I hope we can resolve it just by talking it over.

**[Rin]**<br>
*Haha... Good luck.*

**Sagar**<br>
I'm alright. The journey's just a little long, that's all. We're expecting to arrive in 2 weeks. I may not be able to contact you during that time, so take care of yourself.

**[Rin]**<br>
*Will do. Thanks for thinking of me.<br>
... Alright, I'll get back to work.*

*\[Disconnect\]*

**Sagar**<br>
......<br>
Rin, are you hiding something from me?
