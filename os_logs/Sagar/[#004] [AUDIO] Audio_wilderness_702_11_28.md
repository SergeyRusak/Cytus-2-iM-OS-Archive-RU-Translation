## Log Content
**Exploration Team Member**<br>
Captain, scan's complete. This area's safe.

**Sagar**<br>
Alright, we'll stay here for the night. You guys set up a temporary base.<br>
Big B, Lucy, report back.

**Bruno**<br>
Yessir. Our unit was responsible for investigating Node 13. Currently, we're only able to confirm the position of the watch shop. Tomorrow we'll try to make contact with the shop owner.

**Sagar**<br>
Sounds like things aren't going smoothly.

**Bruno**<br>
You can say that again. The residents in 13 are the same as ever. Ain't exactly what I'd call "welcoming"... <br>
We've only got an hour, and they aren't giving us anything. It's a real headache.

**Alex**<br>
We've got set up camp way out in the sticks? F\*\*\*, what kind of s\*\*\* mission is this? If I would've known I'd have stayed in 08...

**Lucy**<br>
... Why are you here, Jackal?

**Alex**<br>
Huh? You want me to help them guys build a house? Come off it. <br>
What the hell are we doing looking for the owner of a watch shop, Bambi?

**Sagar**<br>
... Did you forget or are you just playing stupid? Colin Neumann Jr.'s watch is custom made. An analysis revealed that it was produced in Node 13. The owner must have some knowledge of where the target is.

**Alex**<br>
Hey, hey. Just let him spill the beans, no? We can use cash, or fists...

**Bruno**<br>
... Control yourself. A.R.C.'s relationship with Node 13 has never improved. If we cause a scene, not only will it be hard to restabilize, but the target will also get away.

**Sagar**<br>
Agreed. Do your best to not use force. Adapt to the circumstances. Next is Lucy... How's the investigation going on "Code Name α"?

**Lucy**<br>
Based on its speed, landing altitude, and calculations of the drone defense systems, we've already excluded the possibility that Code Name α has undergone biotech enhancements or prosthetics.

**Sagar**<br>
So it's not a human...<br>
But drones aren't that agile. Plus, she's clearly intelligent and possesses the ability to speak.

**Alex**<br>
So what is it? A monster from the forbidden areas?

**Lucy**<br>
Not enough info. A better guess would be... an Architect.

**Alex**<br>
Ha!? An Architect? You got water in your brain, sis?

**Sagar**<br>
...It's not impossible.<br>
Lucy, apply for a database from HQ. Search for any abnormal incidents that occurred in Node 08 since N.A 700.

**Bruno**<br>
N.A. 700... Captain, you think that thing followed us into the city?

**Sagar**<br>
It's possible. Given her speed, it wouldn't be difficult for her to escape out from under us. I'm guessing she's been hiding under the surface in 08 ever since then. Since that's the case, she most likely would've left a trace.

**Lucy**<br>
I'll apply, but Code Name α has nothing to do with our case. It's hard to say if HQ will allow it.

**Sagar**<br>
First, give it a try. This thing roams about in the forbidden areas and battled with out of control drones... <br>
... Even though it doesn't have anything to do with the mission, we've got to check it out for the safety of the citizens.

**Alex**<br>
Not again. Just looking for more work... Whatevs, if you're gonna come in contact with her, I want in. Still haven't figured which one of us is the real Alpha.

**Bruno**<br>
Don't act like you two've got a date or something.<br>
Captain, what's your mission?

**Sagar**<br>
Alright, the data from Node 13's old Admin system has been collected from servers that were abandoned by residents in the forbidden areas. With these, 08's weather system can simulate the climate in this area.

**Alex**<br>
Question! Why's your mission so damn easy?

**Lucy**<br>
Circle the outside rim of Node 13 and reach the 5 locations in 2 hours, pass through the craggy desert valley, doesn't sound easy.

**Bruno**<br>
Upgrading the weather system would improve the standard of life in the cities. This is important... <br>
Speaking of which, when the jobs were being dished out, you were out fooling around. Didn't help at all!

**Alex**<br>
Yeah, so what! I only care about being able to send out useful runts during battle.

**Sagar**<br>
Hey, this ain't no complicated mission, but it'd be good if we wrapped this up before the official search... I've got a feeling, that this won't be an easy target.

**Alex**<br>
Bambi's scared, is she?

**Bruno**<br>
Finished, Jackal? Virus viscocity levels are rising. We'd better hurry up and set up camp. Get over here and help out!

**Alex**<br>
...*\*yawn\**... Who do you think I am, villager A? This badass didn't join the exploration team to do crap like this!<br>
Bambi! You know what I'm talking about!

**Bruno**<br>
Oh, shut the hell up and get moving!

*\[Footsteps\]*

**Lucy**<br>
Completely undisciplined.

**Sagar**<br>
Haha... that bugger's always been like this.<br>
But he's right. Alex sure as hell shines on battle missions.

**Lucy**<br>
That's for damn sure.

**Sagar**<br>
Speaking of which, the one who let him into the exploration team... that was me.

**Lucy**<br>
...? I never heard that.

**Sagar**<br>
That was a long time ago...
