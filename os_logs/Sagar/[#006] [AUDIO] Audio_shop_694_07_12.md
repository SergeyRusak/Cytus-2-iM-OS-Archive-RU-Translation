**Shop Manager**<br>
Sagar! Nice work. Would you like to stay and have a meal?

**Sagar**<br>
Thanks! I'm good, I gotta get going so I won't be late for my next gig.

**Shop Employee**<br>
That bugger really does work hard.

*[→Signal Switches]*

*\[Dashes \]*

**Sagar**<br>
Oh no, I'm gonna be late...

**Female**<br>
P\-Please don't do this...

**Man A**<br>
Hey! You're making us look like bad guys.

**Man B**<br>
You best stay in line, lady.

**Sagar**<br>
......

**Man A**<br>
What are you looking at? You wanna get the crap beaten outta you!?

**Sagar**<br>
... No, no.

**Man A**<br>
Then get the hell out of here. It's none of your business.

*\[Footsteps\]*

**Female**<br>
Eh...? Help... ugh!?

**Man B**<br>
Hey, hey! You still calling for help? What the hell is wrong with you?

**Man A**<br>
Don't be silly, we're not gonna do anything......

*\[Fist\]*

**Man A**<br>
RAAAARRGHHHH!!!!!

**Man B**<br>
!?<br>
You......! How'd you get behind me......<br>


*\[Fist\]*

**Man B**<br>
AAARRGGHHHHH!!

**Sagar**<br>
You guys have knives, you think I'm an idiot? I'm not gonna come at you straight on.<br>
Are you alright?

*\[Dashes \]*

**Sagar**<br>
Not even a thank you... forget it.

**Man In Black**<br>
Don't move.

*\[Pulls out a gun\]*

**Sagar**<br>
!?

**Man In Black**<br>
Very... nice. I saw everything.

**Sagar**<br>
What... what do you want...?

**Man In Black**<br>
Don't be nervous, it's just for protection.

*\[Puts the gun away\]*

**Man In Black**<br>
Take it easy, calm down and hear me out.

**Sagar**<br>
You guys harassed an innocent woman. I don't think there's much to talk about.

**Man In Black**<br>
Innocent? You got it all wrong. She's a junkie and owes my friend a ton of cash. So, we were just giving her a chance to pay us back.

**Sagar**<br>
......

**Man In Black**<br>
This is my business card. Please, take it.

**Sagar**<br>
UFZ?

**Man In Black**<br>
Kiddo, you're pretty small, but you've got impressive moves. These two buggers ain't your average buffoon. You've ever been formally trained?

**Sagar**<br>
... When I was little, my dad taught me some.

**Man In Black**<br>
We specialize in providing a platform to those who are interested in hand\-to\-hand combat with absolutely no restrictions. Since it's not under the Bureau's jurisdiction, it's much larger and the audience is a whole lot crazier. Of course, the reward's quite handsome. Whoever wins the preliminary contest gets 10,000 bucks.

**Sagar**<br>
10\-10,000!?

**Man In Black**<br>
That's right. If I write a recommendation letter, you won't have to pay the registration fee——but if you win, I get a 30% commission on the reward. But you still have to pay if you lose. My job is to look for fighters like you.

**Sagar**<br>
Like that woman...?

**Man In Black**<br>
Don't be fooled by her looks, she's really something in the ring. The audience is often satisfied with her performance. It's a pity the drugs ruined her.

**Sagar**<br>
... Is this legal?

**Man In Black**<br>
Haha, didn't I tell you? It's not under the Bureau's jurisdiction, so it's kind of in a gray area. <br>
In any case, if you are confident in your fighting and up for earning some extra cash, then give it a try. I'm no gangster, I am a serious businessman. I won't force you if you aren't interested. 

**Sagar**<br>
