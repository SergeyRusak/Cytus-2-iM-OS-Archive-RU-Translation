*\[Audience applause\]*

**Host**<br>
Ladies and Gentlemen, are you ready to experience pure, primal violence!?

*\[Audience applause\]*

**Host**<br>
Node 08 won't give you entertainment, but we will!! All styles allowed! No weight class! No rules! Hand\-to\-hand combat that only ends when someone gives up or collapses!

*\[Audience applause\]*

**Sagar**<br>
So, so many people... Is this real...?

**Man In Black**<br>
Hmph, we've been up and running for several years already. Still not popular enough. One day, we'll get this entertainment on the Administration Bureau's official platforms.

**Sagar**<br>
No... there's no way, right?

**Man In Black**<br>
Ha! Of course not. We don't get involved in the Administration Bureau's ridiculous relationships. Here, sign this.

**Sagar**<br>
...?

**Man In Black**<br>
If you get injured or die on stage, we're not responsible.

**Sagar**<br>
......

**Man In Black**<br>
What's wrong? Scared?

**Sagar**<br>
... My opponent, is it the guy who just won?

**Man In Black**<br>
That's right. He just came out this year——Red Desert. Right now he's 19\-1. The time he lost he thought the opponent was too weak, so he just forfeited the match. You believe in yourself?

**Sagar**<br>
Tsk... Let's give it a try.

**Man In Black**<br>
Alright, sign here. The host will call you.<br>
... Hey, no one writes their real name for their stage name. I mean, your name is pretty weird... nah, pick something that people will remember.

**Sagar**<br>
Eh? I don't know what to choose...

**Man In Black**<br>
How about I give you one?

*[»»»Fast Forward»»»]*

**Host**<br>
Ladies and Gentlemen～～Sorry to keep you waiting! The time has arrived! With 9 consecutive victories, it's Red Desert, crrrrrrushing his enemies like a bloody sandstorm!!!

**Host**<br>
And the next contender...... oh? Everybody! Looks like we've got another fresh\-faced contender entering the arena! No specific style! An unknown history! 163 cm! 60 kg!

**Audience**<br>
What!? Is that a child?

**Host**<br>
Let's welcome——the little deer～～BAMBI!!!!

**Audience**<br>
 \- WAHAHA! BAMBI!? What a joke!<br>
 \- Hey! Look, it's really a kid!

**Sagar**<br>
Wah... what kind of nickname is that?

**Man In Black**<br>
Haha, it's hobby of mine. This kind of nickname will definitely get everyone talking. Alright, kid. You're up.

**Red Desert**<br>
A kid...<br>
Hey, host.

**Host**<br>
Yes?

**Red Desert**<br>
I forfeit.

**Host**<br>
Eh!?

**Red Desert**<br>
Kid, I don't want to beat you to death. Get out of here.

**Audience**<br>
Boooo～～!!!

**Host**<br>
Red Desert has just announced he will forfeit! Looks like he doesn't think much of his contender! Well, this round...

**Sagar**<br>
How, how do you know if you don't try?

**Red Desert**<br>
What'd you say?

**Sagar**<br>
I've seen how you fight. I... I don't think I'll lose.

**Red Desert**<br>
HEY KID! You wanna die!?

**Sagar**<br>
Your center of gravity is on the left side and I'm guessing your knee's injured? So from the perspective of body type, that's to my advantage. Tsk... that, I'm just guessing...

**Red Desert**<br>
You... Haha, I like it! Let's do this!

*\[Audience applause\]*

**Host**<br>
Oh! Looks like Red Desert has accepted Bambi's challenge and provocations!<br>
Well then! I know we all hate this bulls\*\*\*! Let the competition officially～～BEGIN!!!!

*\[Dashes \]*

**Red Desert**<br>
AAAARRGGHHHHH!!!!!!

**Sagar**<br>

*\[Fists swinging\]*

**Red Desert**<br>
RARGH!!?

**Host**<br>

**Audience**<br>

*\[Falls over\]*

**Sagar**<br>
... You swing a right just 'cuz I said that? Come on, you're a leftie. Tsk... sorry...

**Host**<br>
Red, Red Desert... has been knocked out! In one punch!!!!<br>
The victor! Bambi!!!!

**Audience**<br>
