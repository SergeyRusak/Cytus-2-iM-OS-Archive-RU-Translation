**Bruno**<br>
......

**[Sagar]**<br>
*Calling Big B. What are you doing?*

**Bruno**<br>
...eh, Captain? <br>
Nothing. Just analyzing some old codes.

**[Sagar]**<br>
*Need help? I can arrange for some guys...*

**Bruno**<br>
Almost finished. No worries.<br>
We meeting up?<br>


**[Sagar]**<br>
*Already been 3 minutes... It's not like you to forget.*

**Bruno**<br>
... Damnit... be right there!

*[»»»Fast Forward»»»]*

**Alex**<br>
Big B, what the hell you doing? Squad meeting! You can't just do whatever the f\*\*\* you want.

**Lucy**<br>
Look who's talking.

**Bruno**<br>
Sorry to make you all wait... Captain.

**Sagar**<br>
Alright, everybody listen up.<br>
I've gotten news from HQ that the mission's changed.

**Exploration Team Member T**<br>
Changed? We don't need to arrest the target anymore?

**Sagar**<br>
No, the target hasn't changed. But "bring him back dead or alive" has changed to "it's absolutely necessary that he be brought back alive".

**Alex**<br>
WHAT!?

**Sagar**<br>
... What's the matter, Alex?

**Alex**<br>
Are you kidding me? This ain't gonna be any fun!

**Lucy**<br>
... Captain, considering how dangerous the target is, it's going to extremely difficult to capture him alive. Much more so than shooting him dead. We're going to need a major strategy adjustment.

**Exploration Team Member K**<br>
I agree. The report on the watch shop owner indicated that the target lives deep in the forbidden areas. It'll take us 2 weeks just to get there... the environment's already dangerous enough, now we've got to think of a way to capture the target alive?

**Sagar**<br>
I know this'll increase our workload, but we're Eagle\-01's cream of the crop. I trust it won't be an issue.

**Alex**<br>
Oh, shut it, Bambi! I want out of this boring s\*\*\*!

**Lucy**<br>
Jackal!

**Sagar**<br>
Relax, Lucy.<br>
... Alex, we've got to catch him alive, but I've got a mission I want to give you.

**Alex**<br>
Eh?

**Sagar**<br>
Whether or not he sees it coming, once we find the guy... You're going to smash his right arm.

**Alex**<br>
... Oh...

**Sagar**<br>
Lucy, you're going to use a stun gun to short circuit his right eye. If he loses half of his vision and use of his right arm, his sense of balance will go out of wack. There's no way he'll be able to move with any control.

**Alex**<br>
So, injuring him isn't an issue?

**Sagar**<br>
That's right.

**Alex**<br>
... Hey, you really want to get this guy, huh?

**Sagar**<br>
Of course.<br>
Whatta you think? You want it?

**Alex**<br>
Cut the s\*\*\*! This mission's mine!

**Sagar**<br>
Great. Let's discuss the details.<br>
Everyone else get back in position.

*\[Footsteps\]*

**Lucy**<br>
... Strange.

**Bruno**<br>
Really? Captain's plan sounds right on point...

**Lucy**<br>
I mean you...

**Bruno**<br>
... Me?

**Lucy**<br>
When Captain issued the command, everyone was surprised. You were the only one who maintained a straight face. Almost like you knew what HQ was planning before we did.

**Bruno**<br>
... You're overthinking it.<br>
I've felt like this fugitive was something special since the very beginning. You think A.R.C. would send the entire team of elites just to catch a simple fugitive? There's something more going on. 

**Lucy**<br>
So, you expected something like this to happen?

**Bruno**<br>
In any case, I'm the Captain's primary advisor.

**Lucy**<br>
......

**Bruno**<br>
Are you on edge for Sagar's sake? Relax. I worked with Alex and Sagar before you even joined the squad.<br>
Haha... lots of memories.

**Lucy**<br>
He told me about Jackal.

**Bruno**<br>
Then you oughta hear what happened later... Sagar would happily tell you. He's got a thing for you, after all.

**Lucy**<br>
... As a member of the team.<br>
I'll leave you be.
