We're here. It's this shop. Based on the analyzed data sent down from the top, we've determined that Dr. Neumann is a frequent customer here. We've just got to do a little bit of investigating...

**Lucy**<br>
That easy? Ever since we got here, the people have been on edge...

**Bruno**<br>
It's always been like this... there's nothing we can do. We've got all the required documents. If we show them, it should...

**Alex**<br>
Tsk tsk... Big B, you think too much, bro.<br>
Hey, Bambi, you take that side, okay?

**Sagar**<br>
Jackal!? What happened to your uniform?

**Alex**<br>
Relax. It's noon, time to rest. You guys stay here, I'll go in.

**Sagar**<br>
Hey! Don't you even think about it!

**Alex**<br>
Hey, hey. Once a Jackal is locked onto its prey, it won't let go easily! Check out this performance.

**Sagar**<br>

**Watch Shop Owner**<br>
Welcome! How can I help you?

**Alex**<br>
Wah! I heard this was the most famous handcrafted watch shop in the whole world. It really is, isn't it!

**Watch Shop Owner**<br>
Haha, customer, don't you exaggerate now. I wouldn't dare say the best in the world, but certainly the best in Node 13.

**Alex**<br>
This one! "Eternal", made in N.A 600, right? Wah, never thought I'd get to see the real thing!

**Watch Shop Owner**<br>
Wah! You really know your stuff. That's the work of my great\-grandfather. Whatta you think? Wanna take a photo?

**Alex**<br>
Eh? Nah. I'm like everyone around here, don't like carrying around too much tech. Seeing it with my own eyes is the best way to admire it. You really are a boss! So, you can tell I'm not a local, huh?

**Watch Shop Owner**<br>
Hehe, Node 13 is pretty small. I like your energy! Alrighty then, what can I help you with? You didn't come all this way for a ready\-made product.

**Alex**<br>
You got it. Actually, my brother's birthday's coming up. I wanna get him something real good.

**Watch Shop Owner**<br>
Custom\-made? No problem. What kind of guy is he?

**Alex**<br>
Knew you'd ask. A watch can represent somebody's whole being, their whole personality, am I right?

**Watch Shop Owner**<br>
Nailed it right on the head.

**Alex**<br>
Let me think... he's got a fondness for classical culture, but also a fan of revolution. He's conservative like a gentleman, but when it comes to creativity and philosophy, he's got real balls. Hard to say. I really respect him.

**Watch Shop Owner**<br>
And what work does this brother of yours do?

**Alex**<br>
Oh! He's a classical musician. A lot of his instruments have been imported from Node 13.

**Watch Shop Owner**<br>
What a coincidence... I've got a customer that frequents here often. His personality sounds a lot like your brother. He just ordered a new custom\-made. You want to check out the design? I'm only half done, but it's worth checking out.

**Alex**<br>
Really? Perfect?

*[»»»Fast Forward»»»]*

**Alex**<br>
I see... 6 mm silver\-plated watch base? Lavish, yet not to fancy. I like it. Can you fit it with a leather band to see how it looks?

**Watch Shop Owner**<br>
Of course. The leather's in the back. Give me a sec.

**Alex**<br>
Take your time.

**Alex**<br>
......

*\[Installs transmitter\]*

**Alex**<br>
It's done.

*\[Doorbell\]*

**Watch Shop Owner**<br>
Here you go. We've got several different types. I'd recommend this one. It's got a wood grain texture.

**Alex**<br>
Alright. I trust your judgment. This design is absolutely spectacular. Please, go ahead and set me up with one that has the same style.

**Alex**<br>
Hey.

**Sagar**<br>
So? What'd you do?

**Lucy**<br>
... You didn't punch anyone, did you?

**Alex**<br>
Woah, whatta you think I am? Yo, take this.

**Sagar**<br>
......?<br>
A transmitter?

**Alex**<br>
Put it on Neumann's custom watch, the crafty fella. He won't know a thing.

**Sagar**<br>
! <br>
Nice job, Jackal!

**Alex**<br>
You can praise me after we get him.<br>
By the way, where's Big B?
