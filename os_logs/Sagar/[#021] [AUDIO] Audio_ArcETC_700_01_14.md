**Sagar**<br>
Today's training... ergh... is over. You're free to go!

**Alex**<br>
POWAHAHA! Whaaat? No way! Not like you, buddy!

**Sagar**<br>
Shut it... Did you let me be captain just to laugh at me, or what?

**Alex**<br>
True, true. I don't wanna be making orders all day. True, true. I don't wanna be making orders all day. Those pieces of trash that can't keep up with, then just go and die in a ditch. I suggest you run the team like that, bro.

**Sagar**<br>
You gotta a lot of ideas, why don't you do it... aigh, how can I be imposing like Captain Edwards? I still got a long way to go...

**Alex**<br>
Don't worry about that crap. Let me show something cool.

*[→Signal Switches]*

*\[Gunshot\]*

**Instructor**<br>
Excellent! Lucy, perfect score once more. Everybody, you can learn a thing or two from this.

**Trainees**<br>
Wah...

**Trainee A**<br>
Lucy, you're the best! Teach me!

**Lucy**<br>
... Practice yourself.

*\[Footsteps\]*

**Trainee B**<br>
Ha, you wanna pork her or what? Big mistake. It's no use, I heard Mrs. Freeze's heart was made of ice! Hahaha!

**Sagar**<br>
...So, you took me here to see what?

**Alex**<br>
That lady! A female trainee for the Exploration Team! I just wanna see her put on an official exploration uniform... wah——that's gonna be sexy as all hell!

**Sagar**<br>
Tsk... It's definitely rare that a female comes for the examination. Her long\-distance shooting is very accurate... At that time, I couldn't get a perfect score.

**Alex**<br>
Whatta you think? You wanna abuse the fame of Squad Eagle \- 01 to try and pick her up, you know, the old\-fashioned way?

**Sagar**<br>
Nah... What's the point?

**Alex**<br>
Are you saying that you're not interested in a woman? Or, are you... ughh, don't get near me!

**Sagar**<br>
Even if I were I wouldn't like a nasty dude like you......<br>
?

**Lucy**<br>
......<br>
Are you members of Squad Eagle \- 01?

**Alex**<br>
Wah! Yeah! Alex Flynn a.k.a Jackal, at your service! If you've got anything you don't understand, don't hesitate to ask! I'll give you thorough instructions...eh?

**Lucy**<br>
Sagar... sir, right? Nice to meet you.

**Sagar**<br>
Uh, oh. Nice to meet you...

*\[Footsteps\]*

**Sagar**<br>
......<br>
Strange person.

**Alex**<br>
AAHHH!! Why'd you get to shake her hand!? Let me rub your hand!

**Sagar**<br>
What the hell are you doing!? Disgusting!

*[→File Switches]*

**Instructor**<br>
Today we've invited official members of the Exploration Team to accompany us for today's training! Sagar and Alex here performed exceptionally in the Close Quarters Combat class, so everybody, pay attention and pick up as much as possible.

*[»»»Fast Forward»»»]*

**Lucy**<br>
Ha... Ha...

**Alex**<br>
You're movements need to be softer, yes, yes, yes... just like that——

**Lucy**<br>
Instructor, I want to change partners. This officer keeps groping me.

**Alex**<br>
...eh?

**Instructor**<br>
Jackal! You again! Get over here!<br>
Sagar! Go help her train!

**Alex**<br>
I was just teaching her like normal, that's all... wah! Sir! Please, no! No!

**Sagar**<br>
Eh... I'll do my best... and try not to touch you...

**Lucy**<br>
...*\*nods head\**...

*[»»»Fast Forward»»»]*

**Sagar**<br>
...*\*sigh\**... no, your movements are way off. With gun scores that high, it's surprising how bad you are at hand combat.

**Lucy**<br>
......

**Sagar**<br>
Ah! Don't worry about it! Everyone has something they're good at and something they're not. My written scores were so terrible that I barely skated by. Don't let it get you down...

**Lucy**<br>
......

**Sagar**<br>
……<br>
How embarassing……

**Lucy**<br>
Sir...

**Sagar**<br>
Wah!? Didn't mean to say that. That wasn't what I meant...

**Lucy**<br>
I heard that you're the captain of Eagle \- 01, is that correct?

**Sagar**<br>
... Yes, what's the matter?

**Lucy**<br>
No, it's nothing. Let's continue. I'll try harder.

**Sagar**<br>
Um... oh, okay.

*[→File Switches]*

**Sagar**<br>
...*\*yawn\**...\~\~Finally, it's over...

**Alex**<br>
Hey, Bambi, what's up?

**Sagar**<br>
Whatta you mean what's up? That woman... scary as hell. I have no idea what to say to her...

**Alex**<br>
You... you smell that, right?

**Sagar**<br>
... Smell what? That you're a pervert?

**Alex**<br>
Hehe, you didn't pick up on it? Then forget it. All I can say is, watch out for her.

**Sagar**<br>
......?
