**Alex**<br>
Bambi.<br>
Bambi! Hello?

**Sagar**<br>
... Ah!?<br>
... Sorry, zoning out.

**Alex**<br>
You in heat, bro? Get it together.

**Sagar**<br>
Sorry, just thinking about our first incident with grave robbers.

**Alex**<br>
Hehe, you mean the mission that handicapped captain? This time all we need to worry about is some old fellow.

**Sagar**<br>
... It's just that what we do, every decision we make, will affect more than just ourselves. Even if they have different values from us, that may be the exact reason why they run into harms way, not to mention our partners...

**Alex**<br>
You still thinking about Gary? He's fine. That small of a wound. Just spit on it and it'll heal right up.

**Lucy**<br>
Captain, we're good over here.

**Alex**<br>
Oh ho! Mrs. Freeze, when you wear civilian clothes you look even cuter~

**Lucy**<br>
Get outta here before I put this beetle on your head,

**Alex**<br>
Wha! Sorry! Please, get it away!

**Bruno**<br>
... She's getting better at fending him off.

**Sagar**<br>
Hey, cut it out.<br>
Check your equipment, make sure your time's accurate.

**Lucy**<br>
Captain, sorry, but do I have to work with this piece of trash...?

**Sagar**<br>
We can't apply for a longer border pass in Node 13. If we're going to execute this mission and capture Dr. Neumann, we'll have to wait until he's left the city. If we accidentally start a war inside the city limits, it'll look real bad. Before then, you two will have to surveil his movements. Jackal, are you sure the transmitter's on him?

**Alex**<br>
I saw him pick up the item with my own eyes. The signal is currently inactive inside the city.

**Sagar**<br>
Okay. You two are on it. The rest of us will be spread out in the various exits of Node 13. Maintain contact periodically.

*\[Binoculars\]*

**Lucy**<br>
He's definitely in that house. But... it's already been ten days and he hasn't left.

**Alex**<br>
...*\*yawn\**...~~awww~~borrrrrring.

**[Sagar]**<br>
*Lucy, Jackal, it's time, report back.*

**Alex**<br>
Not so much as peep over here. Ey, if he stays in there for half a year, one year, and never comes out, are we supposed to wait until the fricking sun explodes?

**[Sagar]**<br>
*No, he'll come out. He's not the kind of guy who likes to stay in one place for long periods. He's definitely planning something.*

**Alex**<br>
You know this guy? How can you be sure?

**[Sagar]**<br>
*Intuition...*

**Alex**<br>
... I gotta say, I'll admit that your intuition is right 8 out of 10 times, but when it's not it causes a lot of trouble for the rest of us.

**[Sagar]**<br>
*Eh... sorry.*

**Alex**<br>
But I'll trust you. After all, you make things more interesting, hehe.<br>
In any case, we'll keep up the surveillance until that weasel sticks his head out, over.

**Lucy**<br>
......<br>
It's not like you to talk like that.

**Alex**<br>
Oh? You know how I talk now, do you? Or is this how you lure me in?

**Lucy**<br>
I've still got the beetle.

**Alex**<br>
......<br>


**Lucy**<br>
Don't know how you got into the Exploration Team with such a flippant attitude...

**Alex**<br>
Talent, it was all talent. I'm a genius. <br>
And you? Since when did getting into the Exploration Team become such a high standard?

**Lucy**<br>
... Just wanted to pick on you and your hopeless personality.

**Alex**<br>
Is that so? That's not what I think.<br>
I think... you've changed, Mrs. Freeze.

**Lucy**<br>
......<br>
What are you saying?

**Alex**<br>
Hmm... How do I say... when you first entered, you... smelled like me.

**Lucy**<br>
Disgusting. Do you know how disgusting you smell?

**Alex**<br>
Damn! I'm not talking about your odor. I mean your aura. When I was doing underground fighting I saw a lot of these people, people who had murderous energy, looking for people to prey on.

**Lucy**<br>
......

**Alex**<br>
A jackal's nose is powerful——before, your attitude towards the team was like mine. I don't know what happened between you and Bambi and I ain't gonna ask. But it's clear that your energy's changed.

**Lucy**<br>
......

**Alex**<br>
You... like that bugger, right?

**Lucy**<br>
......!?<br>
No way.

**Alex**<br>
Relax, the radio's off. It's just us two. <br>
Unfortunately, Bambi's heart's taken, can't you see?

**Lucy**<br>
......<br>
I know.

**Alex**<br>
So I'm saying I don't want you to suffer, why don't us two......

*\[Transmitter\]*

**Lucy**<br>
The signal's moving!

**Alex**<br>
...*\*yawn\**...<br>
Hey, where's it at? I don't see anybody!?

**Lucy**<br>
Underground. He's underground but I don't know which passage. Damn. Nothing on the map. If he keeps going he's gonna bypass us all and get out of here.

**Alex**<br>
13's info was always incredibly incomplete. In any case, we're sure he's moving towards the city limits. All we've gotta do is chase him!
