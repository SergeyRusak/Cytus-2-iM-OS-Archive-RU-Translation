**Inhabitant J**<br>
Coming!

**Sagar**<br>
Mrs. James, hello. Got a delivery for you.

**Inhabitant J**<br>
Wah! Such a young delivery boy. Where's Mr. Lee?

**Sagar**<br>
He's in the car. I'm working part\-time. Nice to meet you.

**Inhabitant J**<br>
I see. Well, thank you so much. I'm sorry, but this is quite heavy. Can you take it upstairs all by yourself? ...*\*sigh\**... guess he doesn't want to help you out at all.

**Sagar**<br>
Ah, no problem. I can do it.

**Inhabitant J**<br>
Looks like Mr. Lee's gotten to that age where he doesn't want to move a muscle, haha. I just need to sign, right?

**Sagar**<br>
That's right. Thanks\~

**Inhabitant J**<br>
Not at all. Send Mr. Lee my regards. If he's ever tough on you, you let me know. <br>
I'll send in a little complaint to the company, that'll take care of him.

**Sagar**<br>
Hahaha... I'm sure that's not necessary. All set. Gotta be going.

**Inhabitant J**<br>
Bye\-Bye\~

**Lee**<br>
Oh, everything go well?

**Sagar**<br>
No problem.

**Lee**<br>
Haha, Mrs. James is quite a mouthful, eh? Can't stand it.

**Sagar**<br>
Haha... she seems nice.

**Lee**<br>
Kiddo, you work well. Whatta you think? If you can work during the day I'll consider making you full\-time; of course, you gotta apply with the Administration Bureau and the Academy.

**Sagar**<br>
Oh, sorry. I've got another job in the afternoon...

**Lee**<br>
Oh? You're really giving it your all. You pressed for cash?

**Sagar**<br>
Um, a little, haha...

**Lee**<br>
Picking up chicks?

**Sagar**<br>
Nah, Nah!!! Well, actually...

*[»»»Fast Forward»»»]*

**Lee**<br>
I see... you want to apply for the exploration team. Not bad. That being said, I don't even know what they do. Not many kids like you, saving up for something like that. Impressive.

**Sagar**<br>
Yeah, but the registration fee is really high. Not sure if I can make it this year.

**Lee**<br>
Oh? I see what you're doing. You want a raise, eh? No way! What you get is what you get. But, if you're willing to go full time, that's another story!

**Sagar**<br>
I can't... I still need to keep my grades up, the exploration team also has a written test. Plus... I still haven't told my mom that I'm working.

**Lee**<br>
We're here. We'll talk this over later! No. 53, you got it?

**Sagar**<br>
For sure!

*[→Signal Switches]*

**Sagar**<br>
Number 53... Number 53...

**Riya**<br>
Sagar?

**Sagar**<br>
Wah!? Mom!? What are you doing here!?

**Riya**<br>
I'm the one who should be asking you! Didn't you say you were going to your friend's to play? What are you doing wearing these clothes?

**Sagar**<br>
Uhh... Umm...

**Riya**<br>
Are you... working!? If you need money you can come to me.<br>
... *\*sigh\**...

**Sagar**<br>
......

**Riya**<br>
You... you're not still thinking about that, are you? How many times have I told you? That ain't happening!

**Sagar**<br>
... Mom, please! It's all I want to do! At least let me try!

**Riya**<br>
No WAY! I'm not gonna let the same thing happen to you that happened to your father!

**Sagar**<br>
......

**Riya**<br>
You're coming home with me!

**Sagar**<br>
Dad's job... maybe it looked dangerous to you, but you never even tried to understand it, did you?

**Riya**<br>
......!

**Sagar**<br>
When I was little, the fondest memories I have of Dad are when he would come home and tell me about everything he saw outside the city walls. To me... they were like fairy tales, but he saw it all with his own eyes.

**Riya**<br>
......

**Sagar**<br>
Dad would speak proudly about that, and that made me proud. He never told you because you were always so worried. You never approved of it. But he told me that never got him down because he knew that what he was doing was for the good of the human race.

**Riya**<br>
......!

**Sagar**<br>
So even if you don't approve, I won't feel bad, and I'm not gonna give up! Because I'm his son.

**Riya**<br>
......<br>
Whatever... fine. Just remember you've got to do well in school...

**Sagar**<br>
...! Of course!

**Riya**<br>
... I'm sorry. I'm just worried about you. But I shouldn't control your life.

**Sagar**<br>
It's not like that...

**Riya**<br>
... Plus, you're as dumb as a post, so you're definitely not getting in.

**Sagar**<br>
I... You... What are you saying!? I'll get in, you'll see!

**Riya**<br>
I'm going home. Good luck, dummy.

*\[Footsteps\]*

**Sagar**<br>
Damn...<br>
... Thanks, mom.
