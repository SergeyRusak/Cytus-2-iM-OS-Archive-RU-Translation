*Everyone here is one of a kind, you guys are all elites. Starting from today you'll all be the new blood of the A.R.C. exploration training camp. On behalf of your training instructor, I'm looking forward to seeing you all pass the tests, officially join the unit, and excavate glory for all of mankind.*

**[Edwards]**<br>
*If you guys are lucky enough, we'll meet again... Dismissed.*

*[>>> Fast Forward>>>]*

**Sagar**<br>
... Crap, where is this place? Where's HQ......? Zone C\-2? How did I get here......?

**????**<br>
You lost, Bambi?

*\[Fists\]*

**Sagar**<br>
......!?

*\[Footsteps\]*

**Alex**<br>
Not bad, reactions even faster than before.

**Sagar**<br>
You're... that guy...? Why...

**Alex**<br>
Alex, Jackal, even forgot my name... Let me tell you, I joined the exploration training camp one year earlier than you. According to the tradition here, you gotta call me Officer.

**Sagar**<br>
... You... What are you doing here? Don't tell me you are interested in exploration?

**Alex**<br>
Huh? Of course not. <br>
I'm out for you!

**Sagar**<br>
... Me?

**Alex**<br>
Well, it's not exactly like that. Let me put it this way, I've been after you this whole time.<br>
But you were right, I can't defeat any of those motherf\*\*\*ing training officers! Haha, but I have to admit that this is an interesting place.<br>


**Sagar**<br>
... This is not a place for you to fight.

**Alex**<br>
Whatever. Didn't expect you'd sign up this year, I thought I'd meet you sooner.

**Sagar**<br>
I am poor as dirt, alright?

**Alex**<br>
Yeah, you didn't take that prize money... How can a poor wretch like you get in?

**Sagar**<br>
I... I saved up the money working part\-time.

**Alex**<br>
... Heh.<br>
P\-POOWAHAHAHAHA!

**Sagar**<br>
... What the f\*\*\* are you laughing about?

**Alex**<br>
Hahaha, few days ago I laughed even harder when I saw your enlistment score... the score you got on the written test was worse than mine? You are hilarious!? Haha...

**Sagar**<br>
Cut the crap! At least I got full mark on my physical ability.

*\[Footsteps\]*

**Alex**<br>
Anyone can get full mark on those kinds of tests... Eh, where are you going?<br>
Do you even know where to go?

**Sagar**<br>
......

**Alex**<br>
Just 'cuz you provided me with some entertainment, I'll help you out. Go straight and take two rights to get to an elevator. You can get back to the dorm from there.

**Sagar**<br>
... For real? Don't play me.

*\[Footsteps\]*

**Alex**<br>
What? Look ahead when you are walking.

**Sagar**<br>
How do I know you're not creeping up from behind?

**Alex**<br>
Sounds fun... But no, I was just saying what's up. After you survive the training without breaking any arms or legs, we'll slug it out.

**Sagar**<br>
I already beat your a\*\*.

**Alex**<br>
Hehe, don't underestimate the training here, I am different from the past. Your fist ain't gonna touch me now.

**Sagar**<br>
... That's really not my goal here—— In any case, I won't be defeated. Doesn't matter if it's training or you, Officer.

**Alex**<br>
Hehehe, Really looking forward to it... Bambi.

*\[Footsteps\]*

**Edwards**<br>
... Captain Raymond, that's Luka's son?
