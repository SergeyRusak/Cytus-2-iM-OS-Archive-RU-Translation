C3101? Do we even have a room that begins with C3 in our area?

**Staff B**<br>
In the restricted zone maybe? Go down the hallway 'til you reach the end, then turn left. There's an elevator there. I've rarely been there though, so you might have to look for it yourself after you go up.

**ConneR**<br>
Understood. Thank you for the assistance.

**Rin**<br>
Eek!?... who's there?

**ConneR**<br>
Ah, apologies. Did I scare you? I'm here to take a look at the data I sent in for analysis yesterday... Jesus!

*\[Beast Roars\]*

**Rin**<br>
S....sorry! I'll turn off the projection first!

**ConneR**<br>
I thought one of the forbidden area creatures just broke into the lab... are you working?

**Rin**<br>
Umm... N, not really. I was too enthralled by the environment hologram... sorry. 

**ConneR**<br>
Cough... apologies. I lost my composure back there. <br>
Greetings, Miss Rin. I am Colin Neumann Jr. from Library. Yesterday, I sent in some data of the Node 03 forbidden areas. I'm here to see how the analysis is going. 

**Rin**<br>
I, I'll try and find it. Please wait a minute!

**ConneR**<br>
Don't worry. Take your time.

**Rin**<br>
... Search... Library... Colin...Huh?... No results? Oh no, did I send the data to the wrong address again? Sagar has been sending in so many things recently... schedule... Ah crap\~ No, not this one...

**ConneR**<br>
... Got a problem?

**Rin**<br>
*\*Almost crying\**  J, just another minute. I'm this close to finding it...

**ConneR**<br>
Um, the file that is on your left screen should be the one I'm looking for.

**Rin**<br>
Huh? Ah! You're right. I was looking in the wrong unit... sorry.

**ConneR**<br>
No big deal. I would prefer if you stop apologizing so much though. It's making me a bit embarrassed

**Rin**<br>
I'm sorry...

**ConneR**<br>
Haha... I must say, this is quite the room. All this plant life, looks like it's been abandoned for years... Don't see scenery like this in A.R.C. too often.

**Rin**<br>
Yes, I really enjoy growing these plants... I\-I'm sorry. I've been living here all alone. I haven't organized them properly, so it's quite chaotic...

**ConneR**<br>
A single person managing such a large research space? You look like you're in your early twenties...<br>
It seems A.R.C. has a knack for child geniuses. First Mr. Sagar, then Mr. Xenon, now you... I take back my previous views on "talent"...

**Rin**<br>
Ummm... I...

**ConneR**<br>
Ah, my apologies. It's very rude to ask a lady about her age. What's wrong with me?

**Rin**<br>
I don't mind...

**ConneR**<br>
Let me take a look at the data...<br>
I see... a very detailed analysis indeed. So many little things that I didn't notice. Just as good as they say. You really do know a lot about Node 03's culture. 

**Rin**<br>
T, Thank you.

**ConneR**<br>
Have you stayed at Node 03 before?

**Rin**<br>
Yes. Node 03 is my hometown. 

**ConneR**<br>
I've never been there. What kind of place is it?

**Rin**<br>
I haven't gone back in a long time... but from what I remember, it's a very beautiful place. The people are kind and passionate. The culture and the architectures are very different from here. It's a colorful and very lively city. 

**ConneR**<br>
Hm? From what I've heard, their administration bureau crumbled after "The Decommission". The entire city has been under the control of law\-breakers for more than a hundred years. How long ago was the Node 03 you stayed in?

**Rin**<br>
Umm... there are still places that are very pretty... I, I don't remember it too clearly. All things from a long time ago...Ah! 

*\[Cup Spills\]*

**ConneR**<br>
Yikes!

**Rin**<br>
Oh no, oh no, oh no... I'm so sorry. Are you injured!?

**ConneR**<br>
No, I'm fine. The tea is not hot anymore. Good thing it's not my right arm that got spilled on. Haha...

**Rin**<br>
Uguu... I'm sorry. I've always been a very clumsy person...

**ConneR**<br>
It's alright. Only a little bit of tea actually got me. I shall no longer disturb you. The analysis is very detailed and well\-done. Thank you. <br>
In a few days, there should be a new set of statistics sent here. I'll see you then. Goodbye. 

**Rin**<br>
U, Understood. I'll try my best!
