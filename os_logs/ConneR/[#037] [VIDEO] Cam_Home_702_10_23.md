**ConneR**<br>
Sagar, I didn't expect you to escort me home yourself. This isn't something a person of your level should do, isn't it?

**Sagar**<br>
Your father——Sir Colin is a figure I have great respect for as well. His contributions... as a member of the A.R.C. exploration team, I feel like I should be present here too...

**ConneR**<br>
Is that so? Then what a shame. It took A.R.C. so long to review my absence permission that neither of us was able to see him one last time...

**Sagar**<br>
I'm terribly sorry about that... I didn't act fast enough. You have my condolences.

**ConneR**<br>
No, you already exercise your authority to speed up the review process as much as possible, right? I can already imagine the loads of reports you are going to have to write for this.<br>
I owe you a favor again.

**Sagar**<br>
Ah, please don't say that...<br>
But to be honest... never thought that it would be this sudden...

**ConneR**<br>
This is nothing special. People are always convinced that they can see the threads of destiny, yet they can never imagine that they're just a mere pawn on the chessboard.<br>
Even if they reached the final row and become a queen, they are still locked inside the domain of a "chess move", with no escape in sight.

**ConneR**<br>
... Just playthings after all, we humans are.

**Sagar**<br>
Doctor...

**ConneR**<br>
Heard that the situation is still a bit chaotic inside. Would you mind letting me take a look at him first myself?<br>
You'll have to wait for me here for a while.

**Sagar**<br>
Of course.

**Grace**<br>
Master...! *\*Cries\**...

**ConneR**<br>
Don't cry, Grace...<br>
You mentioned in the letter, that father was doing some strange things in his room?

**Grace**<br>
Yes, master... I really... don't know how to describe it...

**ConneR**<br>
... Tell me about it to the best of your abilities.

**Grace**<br>
OK... I was in the kitchen at the time. I started running to Sir's room after I heard the alarm. On my way, I constantly heard the noise of things breaking and Sir screaming...

**ConneR**<br>
Screaming? Hasn't father been completely motionless for the past few years?

**Grace**<br>
Yes, that's why I was a little hopeful that maybe Sir recovered... However, when I opened the door, I discovered that Sir was screaming while breaking the furniture. He even broke the window, then grabbed the shards with his bare hand and started carving on the wall... Blood spewed everywhere...

**ConneR**<br>
!?

**Grace**<br>
Sir's expression... it's like he lost his mind. He was agitated with white foam coming out of his mouth... I was utterly shocked; I even forgot to stop Sir. I just stood there and watched as Sir carved up the entire wallpaper... I... *\*Cries\**...

**ConneR**<br>
It's not your fault, Grace... What happens next?

**Grace**<br>
Afterward... Sir stopped, and he looked at me...<br>
... It's not an illusion... Sir called my name.

**ConneR**<br>
......!

**Grace**<br>
*\*Sobs\**... I don't know how many years it has been since I last heard those words... "Grace, it's you"...<br>
Just as I regain my senses to answer... Sir... he just...

**ConneR**<br>
He just collapsed... didn't he.

**Grace**<br>
Yes...

**ConneR**<br>
If the doctors' diagnostics were correct and what father had was indeed neurodegenerative dementia, he shouldn't be able to regain consciousness or recognize you. Not to mention flipping over furniture and breaking items with his own self\-consciousness...

**Grace**<br>
I don't understand things that are too complicated... We're here, master. As you requested, I haven't moved anything in here. Please take a look...

*\[Door Opens\]*

**ConneR**<br>
This is...!

**ConneR**<br>
......

**Grace**<br>
Master...

**ConneR**<br>
... Grace, could you please leave me alone for a moment?

**Grace**<br>
Yes, master... I'll be waiting outside the door. If you need anything, call me.

**ConneR**<br>
Thank you.

*\[Door Opens\]*

**ConneR**<br>
......

**ConneR**<br>
Father... If you haven't gone completely insane... then you truly left me something incredible...
