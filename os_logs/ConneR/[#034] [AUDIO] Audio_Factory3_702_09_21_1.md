*\[Engines turned off\]*

**Xenon**<br>
We're here.

**ConneR**<br>
I'm impressed that you people even found this location. Even the admins have removed this location from their maps.

**Xenon**<br>
We were only able to reach here by following the coordinates... Hey, stop wandering around. Follow me closely.

**ConneR**<br>
Yes Sir\~

*[Signal Switches]*

*\[Walking Down The Stairs\]*

**A.R.C. Employee A**<br>
So you guys are here. We went ahead and started the recovery progress for some of the items. These are equipment that was previously stolen... but that's not all of it. Some of the items here don't even exist on the list of artifacts. We will directly send those to Library.

**Xenon**<br>
... Hey, where are the robot remains? Didn't I tell you guys to not touch the things on the floor for now?

**A.R.C. Employee B**<br>
Err... about that... When we got down here, we didn't see any remains on the floor. The equipment was all there was.

**Xenon**<br>
How's that possible? It's a robot that looks just like the one in this photo. How can something that big just disappear into thin air?

**A.R.C. Employee A**<br>
We really didn't see it.

**Xenon**<br>
... The admins immediately locked down the area around here. No one should be able to come into this room before you guys...

**ConneR**<br>
... Water is dripping from up there.

**Xenon**<br>
......?

**ConneR**<br>
However, the water marks are cut off right here. The shape of the cut\-off is exactly the same as what you showed me in the photo.

**Xenon**<br>
That's the position where it collapsed.

**ConneR**<br>
Which means it was here not too long ago...<br>
There are no dragging marks on the floor. Judging by how damaged it was in the photo, we should be able to exclude the possibility of it moving on its own first. <br>
Model OPCI Architects weight around 100 kilograms. If someone were to haul it away, that creaky staircase we just came down from would definitely not survive all that extra pressure.

**ConneR**<br>
This hole you are using to crane the equipment was just opened by you folks, right? Which means that the robot was moved using other methods... Of course, there's also the possibility that it was hidden away by you folks.

**A.R.C. Employee A**<br>
... And what benefit would we get from doing such a thing!?

**ConneR**<br>
Who knows? When it comes to information about the Architects, A.R.C. has always been trying their damnedest to hide them. It's as if there's some major secret that they are afraid to let the public learn about. If it's an order from your superiors, you folks have no choice but to obey them, don't you?

**A.R.C. Employee B**<br>
If you don't shut your damn mouth...!

**Xenon**<br>
Enough. They are just employees. It's pointless to have these arguments here.

**ConneR**<br>
Haha. I was just kidding. Come on guys, don't be so tense.

**Xenon**<br>
... What should we do now?

**ConneR**<br>
Use your A.I. It should be able to rewind any electronic trace that once existed here, right? Let's give it a try and see if we can find any useful information.

**Xenon**<br>
I can try... However, it functions by connecting to cyTus. The signal here is not very good, so I don't know how effective it is going to be.

**[Xenon A.I.]**<br>
*Rewind Starts*

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

**[Xenon A.I.]**<br>
*Rewind Complete*

**Xenon**<br>
... No good. All it got was signal fragments, nothing noteworthy.

**ConneR**<br>
... Mr. Xenon, it seems that your guess was spot\-on. This particular Architect is very likely to be nothing more than a mere puppet.

**Xenon**<br>
Hmm?

**ConneR**<br>
Zoom in on the area around the head. You can see some command codes, right? These are very basic commands that even crane game machines in the arcades can process. What this represents is that this thing has long lost its ability to function on its own. It only acts based on the command input.

**Xenon**<br>
True... You really do notice the tiniest of details.

**ConneR**<br>
So now, the problem comes down to this: who's the puppeteer? I still feel like A.R.C. is the primary culprit since it's so easy for them to play the victim and act as if they have nothing to do with all this. Collecting users' memories and information for some shady behind\-the\-scenes dealings, then dump all the criminal charges on a virtual idol they fabricated themselves...

**A.R.C. Employee A**<br>
F\*\*\* are you still talking about that crap?

**Xenon**<br>
Hey, shut up. Did you forget that I still have the switch to your cuffs? I can electrocute you anytime, you know.

**ConneR**<br>
Ohhhh\~ Scary\~

**Xenon**<br>
... Let's talk about this outside.
