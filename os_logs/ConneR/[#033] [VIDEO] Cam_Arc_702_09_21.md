**ConneR**<br>
It has been a while, Mr. Xenon. You've been on break for quite a long time. Tea?

*\[Drinks Tea\]*

**Xenon**<br>
I'm not here to chit\-chat. I have something to ask you.

**ConneR**<br>
About Æsir, I presume?

**Xenon**<br>
... How did you know?

*\[Drinks Tea\]*

**ConneR**<br>
*\*Chuckles\** Young man, you have to be more conscious of your words. You spill your secrets too easily.

**Xenon**<br>
......

**ConneR**<br>
I am personally quite interested in him as well. Therefore, I did some "investigation" on my own. That's how I knew you are investigating him as well. The recent incident with Miss Kittyears, it has something to do with this, isn't it?<br>
I figure that if you are actively seeking my advice, it's probably about this case. 

**Xenon**<br>
Investigation? You are using the company's equipment for private stuff again...

**ConneR**<br>
Young man, you can't blame me for that. Do you have any idea how easy it is to bypass the security system these days when you are not around? It's so easy that I almost fell asleep doing it.

**Xenon**<br>
... I'll let it slide. I want you to take a look at this photo.

**ConneR**<br>
......!

**Xenon**<br>
What do you think this object looks like?

**ConneR**<br>
Judging from the parts... it's a model OPCI "Architect". However, its appearance is not exactly the same... so this is the extent of how similar to humans they can get...?  These wretched monsters...<br>
... Where did you get this photo?

**Xenon**<br>
I tracked a signal source Æsir accessed last year. In the end, I found that it originated from an abandoned factory. We came across this thing in the factory and it attacked us.

**ConneR**<br>
Us?

**Xenon**<br>
... A fellow friend who was with me at the time.

**ConneR**<br>
Ah\~ the Miss Cherry who's on the news a lot these days?

**Xenon**<br>
......

**ConneR**<br>
No need for the scary face. I have no interest in gossip about your relationships. Then? Did you guys destroy it?

**Xenon**<br>
With a pulse pistol. It is no longer operational, but the core should still be intact.

**ConneR**<br>
What a shame... do you realize how precious still\-operational Architects are? Most of the ones we found are already piles of useless junk.

**Xenon**<br>
... However, it seems that it was already on the verge of falling apart before we attacked it. Its actions are really weird too. My guess is that it's a puppet of Æsir, yet I have no idea how he got his hands on this stuff.

**ConneR**<br>
*\*Chuckles\** Young man, if there's a will, there's a way. A.R.C. is not the only one capable of retrieving resources from the Ruins. Many so\-called "Gravediggers" like myself are still very much alive and well out there. Of course, I will not tell you any names.

**Xenon**<br>
... Whatever. I presume that you've come in contact with them before? The Architects, I mean.

**ConneR**<br>
As I said before, the things we found are all junk that had been broken for ages. The amount of information we can retrieve from them is very limited because of that. My only experience with still\-operating ones was the incident at the Ruins outside of Node 13. Due to that god\-forsaken incident, I can't feel the violin bow anymore. Damnit...

**Xenon**<br>
From what I heard, you were indeed assaulted.

**ConneR**<br>
But, I guess all those lies I told in the past have to come back and bite me someday. Nobody believed me... Worst of all, I caused the whole place to collapse. Not even Sagar and his team can recover any evidence.<br>
I mean, it's an entire group of functioning ones! What a waste... 

**Xenon**<br>
... Anyhow, if I take you to that factory now, will you be able to recover something from its core? I'm going back there again with company personnel to retrieve an A.R.C. analyzer and some other equipment left on\-site. They're probably all stolen by that guy.

**ConneR**<br>
I am indeed very interested... if you believe me to be trustworthy. I mean, it's not like there's a lack of options; plenty of folks to chose from in the research department.

*\[Drinks tea\]*

**Xenon**<br>
I don't trust you. However, right now I have even less trust in those who are affiliated with the Administration Bureau.

**ConneR**<br>
A wise decision. You made a smart choice, for once.

**Xenon**<br>
Put this on.

**ConneR**<br>
Hoho? A tri\-handcuff used by the admins. This is the version altered by the A.R.C., I presume? Even though it became a twisted pile of ugliness, it's much harder to crack now.

**Xenon**<br>
Your bail is granted under my application. If you do anything remotely suspicious, you will be electrocuted.

**ConneR**<br>
Yes\~, Yes\~, I get that.
