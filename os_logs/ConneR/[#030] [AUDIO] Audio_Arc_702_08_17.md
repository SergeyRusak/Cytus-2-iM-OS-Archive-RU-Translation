**Rin**<br>
EEK!?

**ConneR**<br>
Ah, apologies. Did I scare you again? I rang the doorbell several times, but nobody answered...

**Rin**<br>
Ah, hello, Dr. Neumann. Sorry about that; I was in the internet...<br>
Oh, about the data you sent in a few days ago, the analysis was just completed. I'll go get it.

**ConneR**<br>
Oh? Is it done already? That's unexpectedly quick; I thought it still needs several days.

**Rin**<br>
Uh? Aren't you here for the analysis report?

**ConneR**<br>
No. I might have left my watch here during my last visit. Have you seen it somewhere?

**Rin**<br>
Ah. I remember you taking it off when I spilled the tea. Let me see if I can find it...

**ConneR**<br>
It should be on the shelf way back there.

**Rin**<br>
U, understood. I'll go take a look.

**ConneR**<br>
......

*\[Extracting Data\]*

**ConneR**<br>
......

**Rin**<br>
Doctor, this is the watch, right?

**ConneR**<br>
Yes, Thank you.<br>
Since the analysis report is ready, I guess I'll have the pleasure of reading it now.

**Rin**<br>
Sure, unfortunately, the analysis this time is not quite positive...<br>
About your "artifact" I didn't find any related information that is worthy of further research...

**ConneR**<br>
Let me take a look... Hm, what a pity. The clues in Node 03 are the only ones I haven't done research. I thought bringing it here to you might enlighten some possibilities.

**Rin**<br>
I'm very sorry...

**ConneR**<br>
No worries; there are still plenty of analyses I can use as references. <br>
To be honest with you, I'm more curious about your personal opinion on this artifact.

**Rin**<br>
Uh? Mine?... This looks like some kind of... chip? I'm certain it uses ancient technology, but I've never seen an artifact quite like it... May I ask where did you obtain this? 

**ConneR**<br>
This? Well, I can tell you, but only if you promise me that you'll keep a secret. Can you do that?

**Rin**<br>
Huh? Um... s, sure...

**ConneR**<br>
This is a Neumann family treasure that has been passed down for generations, starting from our ancestors before "The Decommission". For two hundred years, no one really knew its meaning and purpose, until my father joined A.R.C. and started researching it. 

**Rin**<br>
Eh? Pre\-Decommission... how come an artifact of such importance is not part of A.R.C.'s listings...?

**ConneR**<br>
For some reason, father didn't hand this item to A.R.C.; instead, he chose to study it himself. However, even after all these years, he made little to no progress. Now a sickly old man, he passed it down to me. 

**Rin**<br>
My sincere condolences...

**ConneR**<br>
I believe this chip is the key to understanding ancient technology, which is everything that was left behind by the "Old Humans" for modern humans. It's also the key to allow humans to escape from this made\-up peace we are in right now. We no longer have to live in this deadly greenhouse. 

**Rin**<br>
D, deadly...?

**ConneR**<br>
Father had a terrifying experience of being assaulted while exploring the Ruins. To make matters worse, I also had a similar experience myself. My right arm and eye are in their current state because of that attack...

**Rin**<br>
......

**ConneR**<br>
It's common to be assaulted during exploration, be it wild creatures or even other explorers. That is what they've been telling me too...<br>
But no... if you ask me, those "things" are not creatures nor humans. They're more like... "Architects". Although it's hard to believe that Architects still exists after The Decommission, and even harder to believe that they will actually perform those actions.

**Rin**<br>
... I, is it possible that you made a mistake? It could be illusions or memory displacements caused by inhaling minor doses of the virus in the forbidden areas...

**ConneR**<br>
Miss Rin, I've been exploring by myself without support from A.R.C. for over a decade now. I know the difference between the effects of the virus and what I saw with my own eyes. <br>
If I don't get to the bottom of that "thing" that assaulted us, I have a feeling that in the future, this will be a worldwide catastrophe for the human race.

**Rin**<br>
......

**ConneR**<br>
My, my. Look what I've done. Yapping so long about such heavy topics...<br>
Don't know why, but I feel especially relaxed in this messy, laid\-back environment and in front of you. I don't usually say this much to other people. Apologies. 

**Rin**<br>
I, I don't mind. Thank you for willing to share these with me...

**ConneR**<br>
You won't spill the beans, right? I trust you. 

**Rin**<br>
Yes... of course, I won't!

**ConneR**<br>
Lunch break is about to end too. I'll go back to work. Goodbye.

**Rin**<br>
OK. Bye\-bye.
