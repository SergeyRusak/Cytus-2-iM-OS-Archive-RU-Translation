*Year J model student representative Zoe Watson, please come to the stage for your speech.*

*\[Applause\]*

**Student A**<br>
Of course it's Zoe!

**Zoe**<br>
Haha, I'll be right back.

**Zoe**<br>
Another year has passed. I am extremely blessed to be given the honor to deliever a speech as the model student representative again this year. I believe that everyone has encountered all kinds of difficulties on their path to knowledge...

**Student A**<br>
Zoe is so amazing. Every year her speech is so touching. I expect no less from "Miss Academy"!

**Zoe**<br>
Haha, what's that name? Don't call me that.

**Student B**<br>
It's true! You're already a top celebrity in the Academy! Just look at how the underclassmen look at you.

**Zoe**<br>
Oh, please... But giving a speech every year makes me really tired too. Writing a speech isn't easy and I'm always afraid that people will be bored.

**Student A**<br>
Not at all. If you keep at it, you'll be the model student representative next year as well.

**Zoe**<br>
Ah\*... Next year, I may not be here anymore.

**Student A**<br>
Wahh!?!? Why?

**Zoe**<br>
I got the recommendation, so I'm going to the Law Enforcement Academy.

**Student B**<br>
Eh!? Isn't that great? I told you your grades wouldn't be an issue!

**Student A**<br>
But we'll all be lonely without you here,...

**Zoe**<br>
Haha, it's not like we won't ever see each other. It's my dream, even though it's much earlier than I imagined...

**Student B**<br>
Do it! You have all of our blessings!

**Zoe**<br>
Wahh!!

*\[Falls down\]*

**Trainer**<br>
Watson! Keep up! You want to be last in the class again?

**Zoe**<br>
No sir! Sorry!

**Trainer**<br>
Don't think your grades mean anything here. If you get last place here, you're getting flunked the hell out of here!

**Zoe**<br>
*\*heavy breathing\*.......!*

**Zoe**<br>
Trainee S6870939, Zoe Watson reporting.

**Andrew**<br>
In just a few months, you've gotten full score on all the credits in physical training. I didn't make a mistake when I chose you.

**Zoe**<br>
Yes, sir! Captain taught me very well, sir!

**Andrew**<br>
Watson, You said you wanted to join my squad, right? Tell me why.

**Zoe**<br>
Yes. Captain Wood's Squad 3, despite the squad's relatively low ranking position, is the most effective and best\-performing Law Enforcement Squad. If I join the team, I believe the squad will be more dynamic and can climb to a higher position and put an end to even more crimes!

**Andrew**<br>
I see... You really have good eyes. It's been a long time since I saw such stellar performace from one of my trainees.

**Zoe**<br>
Thank you Captain for the compliment!

**Andrew**<br>
From now on, this conversation will not be recorded. Just we two will know. Watson, I'd like to give you a very special opportunity.

**Zoe**<br>
Opportunity...?

**Andrew**<br>
The current Administartion Bureau... Let's just say there's a lot of red tape involving various organizations. If this continues, no matter how hard we try to stop criminal activities on the surface, these organizations will simply yield greater and greater power in the shadows of society. That's why I initiated this plan. 

*\[File Projection\]*

**Zoe**<br>
"Infiltration Plan"...?

*[→File Switches: 689\_08\_06]*

**Zoe**<br>
Coral! Get up! Get up!

**Coral**<br>
He... hehe... saved by the last in the class. How embarassing.

**Zoe**<br>
This is our last time operation. We're going to wear our Enforcement Agent uniform together, right? Don't you dare die on me here!

**Coral**<br>
Ha... don't be silly... That bastard never had the intention to give us back our uniforms.

**Zoe**<br>
......

**Coral**<br>
You knew very well yourself, didn't you...? How many shots have we taken doing  these scumbag jobs... you... are you... Zoe? Or Sasha?

*\[Gunshots\]*

**Coral**<br>
Go... now... Go back... and tell Wood... for my sake... tell him...

**Zoe**<br>
Coral!!

**Coral**<br>
To go f\*\*\* himself...

**Zoe**<br>
Coral！！
