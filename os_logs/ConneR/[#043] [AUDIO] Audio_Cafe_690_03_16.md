... This seems like a pretty significant deal. Never thought it would be from such a young lad like you. 

**ConneR**<br>
I may look like this, but if it's about information and data, I know my stuff.

**Saxon**<br>
You seem quite confident... I'm already too old to understand the stuff you youngsters are up to these days... Despite that, I'd advise you to be careful. In this world, those who want to be the lion often end up on the wrong end of a bite.

**ConneR**<br>
Is that so... thank you for the advice. I will keep it in mind.

Ugh! Haa... Whew...

**ConneR**<br>
Woah!? Hey! You... are you alright!? You're bleeding really badly...

**???**<br>
Got busted! Pops... gimme a hand, will you...

**Saxon**<br>
... You got shot! Did the transaction fail?

**???**<br>
Hehe... what transaction fail? Did you not see these two cases...<br>
Ugh!

*\[Alarm\]*

**Saxon**<br>
Save that for later. The law enforcement agents are patrolling. Go hide in the basement, quick!<br>
Young lad! Accompany her downstairs and help treat her wounds. I'll take care of the things here.

**ConneR**<br>
Ah! ... Got it!
