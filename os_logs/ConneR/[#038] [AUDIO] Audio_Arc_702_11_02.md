**Sagar**<br>
Apologies for the interruption. Doctor...?

**ConneR**<br>
......

**Sagar**<br>
......?

**[TV]**<br>
*... discovered a large number of commands used by said A.I. to commit internet crimes, which even includes the infamous cyberterrorism incident during a live stream a few months ago. All this evidence are proof of Simon Jackson's highly possible association with Æsir. *

**Sagar**<br>
This is... the Æsir incident? Heard about it a while ago. It seems like it's a pretty serious issue...

**ConneR**<br>
Ah, Mr. Sagar. Apologies, I didn't notice you. So you don't know the details regarding this incident?

**Sagar**<br>
Sorry, I just returned from the outside and I'm leaving for the outside again very soon. Therefore, I don't really have time to pay attention to the news in the city... However, I have heard about the major cyberterrorism attack during a live stream. Didn't expect him to be the culprit.

**ConneR**<br>
This Simon, you guys count as colleagues as well, right? You don't seem to know him very well?

**Sagar**<br>
We met a few times. I'm not exactly knowledgeable about internet stuff, so I've asked for his assistance in the past when organizing the documents for the artifacts. Never thought that he was Æsir himself...... Such a key figure in the company turns out to be a criminal. I guarantee that the higher\-ups are in a chaotic state now.

**ConneR**<br>
Him, you, Miss Rin too... A.R.C. is truly full of all kinds of "amazing" people... I'm impressed.

**Sagar**<br>
Doctor, I don't know whether I should laugh or not about that comment...

**ConneR**<br>
Setting aside the criminal suspicions, all of you are elites who are far superior to your average person. This is a compliment through and through. Accept it with ease.

*\[Drinks tea\]*

**ConneR**<br>
Speaking of which, do you need something from me today, Mr. Sagar?

**Sagar**<br>
Oh, nothing major... It's just that last week when applying for your absence permission, I bypassed quite a few procedures. Now, the higher\-ups want me to provide the full report. I need doctor to confirm the report in person.

**ConneR**<br>
So you came to me for such a mundane reason...?<br>
Looks like even though it's filled with talented people, this place is still filled with ancient and obscure rules, as well as management who's brains have rotten to the core from the lack of usage.

**Sagar**<br>
... Doctor, every word of our conversation is being recorded, you know.

**ConneR**<br>
That's precisely why I said it. Give me the report.

**Sagar**<br>
No problem. I've sent the file. Doctor, please check it. If you have any problem, just point it out for me and I'll fix it immediately.

*\[Signature\]*

**Sagar**<br>
Eh? Doctor... You didn't even look at it...

**ConneR**<br>
I said before, I already owed you a favor. If I cause you any more trouble, it will be against the etiquette of the Neumann family. I will feel very terrible about it.<br>
This report, I have confirmed it. No problem at all.

**Sagar**<br>
Great! Doctor, you really help me. Thank you!

**ConneR**<br>
Very well. Allow me to say one more thing, Mr. Sagar. These wordy regulations do not suit you. The place where you can showcase your talents is the forbidden area. That expansive world filled with secrets, that is the place you should call home to.

**Sagar**<br>
Haha... Not like I want to do all this, but I can't help it. It's part of my responsibility as a captain...<br>
I shall not bother you any longer. I'll go finish the procedure first.

*\[Door Opens\]*

**ConneR**<br>
... Resume call.

**[System]**<br>
*Encrypted call reconnected. Resume in three seconds...... 2...... 1...... Call resumed.*

**ConneR**<br>
Sorry about the long wait.<br>
Like I just mentioned, I want information on the Æsir incident... as well as info about the arrest of that unlucky boy. The more detailed, the better.

**[???]**<br>
*Simon Jackson... is it?*

**ConneR**<br>
Rest assured. I am not related in any manner to said incident. I've been your customer for more than a dozen years. I believe I'm quite trustworthy, right?

**[???]**<br>
*...... Understood. What are your chips?*

**ConneR**<br>
Haha, the things I can provide, you should know them very well.

**[???]**<br>
*Just a usual question to make sure, Mr. R.<br>
I will find a seller for you. You will receive what you requested very soon. I'll make sure of that.*

**ConneR**<br>
I'll let you handle this, successor. As with this Martini, put it on the tab for now.
