**ConneR**<br>
Good afternoon sir. May I sit here?

**Xenon**<br>
... What do you want?

**ConneR**<br>
Don't be so hostile. This is a pretty nice place to have lunch, never realized that before.

**Xenon**<br>
I'm on my break now. If there's a problem, file a work request.

**ConneR**<br>
*\*Chuckles\** Don't worry I'm not asking you to work. Just want to chat with you a little. May I, Mr. Xenon?

**Xenon**<br>
...Don't call me that at work.

**ConneR**<br>
Apologies, but you aren't exactly keeping a low profile. I've had the pleasure of listening to your album.

**Xenon**<br>
Oh.

**ConneR**<br>
It's quite interesting. In terms of composing, there's plenty of digital mixing and post\-production edits. However, when it comes to the all\-important strings, you didn't abandon the traditional method of physical resonance. I admire that.

**Xenon**<br>
If the strings became digital as well, the guitar would have no life. It certainly wouldn't sound good.

**ConneR**<br>
Ohhh, not what I expect to hear from someone who works in such a lifeless environment. Lives among technology and machines every day, yet your music is still full of emotion. It seems that on this front, we have a consensus.

**Xenon**<br>
Don't speak like you know me so well...

**ConneR**<br>
*\*Chuckles\**  Maybe I know you a lot better than you think.<br>
Technology is the torch that lights the road for humans and we are the ones holding it. Our every action directly affects the future of the human race.

**Xenon**<br>
That only applies to you right? I'm not that great.

**ConneR**<br>
Don't underestimate yourself. It's a complete tragedy for a talent like you to be at the bottom. I look forward to the day you make your leap to the top.

**Xenon**<br>
... Thanks for the compliment.

**ConneR**<br>
This is my album. If you don't mind, give it a try and tell me what you think about it.

**Xenon**<br>
If I'm in the right mood.

**ConneR**<br>
*\*Chuckles\** quite indifferent are you. Then I shall take my leave. Enjoy your break, Mr. Xenon.

**Xenon**<br>
I would appreciate that.
