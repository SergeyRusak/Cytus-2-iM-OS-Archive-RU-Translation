        Father's dying message, "Kl√§nge des Herzens", is a phrase written in a language that has appeared multiple times on ancient Node 13 documents. It means "Sound of the Heart". However, even after deciphering the message, I am still completely lost. The flow of the words feels like some type of hidden code. 

        My instincts tell me, that in order to find out the direction this clue is taking me, a return to Node 13 is very much inevitable. 

        I am beginning to understand the reason why father chose to keep this a secret until he lost his mind: we're talking about the mystery of the whole world! My father and I have the same kind of blood flowing through us. When it comes to pursuing the truth, we are father and son; at the same time, we are also each other's closest enemy. Now, with father having passed away, the message on the wall and the research he left behind are the most valuable items I can ever inherit. They are the most precious "voices" that can lead me to my ultimate destination. 

        A while ago, the admins caused a major commotion when they broke into A.R.C. for the arrest. That gave me the opportunity to sneak into the Library. I was able to obtain the secrets hidden within, and let's just say that calling the things I discovered "significant" would be a severe understatement. However, with my current skills, I couldn't delve any further. In order to solve that lock at the deepest part of the puzzle, I would need to obtain more information. I would also need the assistance of some other people, including that unlucky guy who got arrested. 

        Next, I also need to do some preparations: excavation machinery, traveling permits to Node 13 and 03, a fake identity and a Mediator.

        The plan is about to progress into the next stage. I no longer need this specious cage in the sky. Although there are still interesting toys here like Mr. Sagar and Miss Rin, the phantom of the truth is wavering in front of me, like the Dance of the Seven Veils. I shall follow it into the depth of the abyss as well.

        The first bar of Salome has been sounded. It's time to move.
