How unfortunate. We could've enjoyed yesterday's meal together.

**???**<br>
If a particular wanted criminal didn't cause a huge ruckus in 08's restricted area while on the run, we indeed could've.

**ConneR**<br>
It has been a long time, Sasha.

**Sasha**<br>
You... really have gotten old.

**ConneR**<br>
And you're as beautiful as you always have been.

**Sasha**<br>
*\*Chuckles\** Thank you. Come on in.

*[â†’Signal Switches]*

**ConneR**<br>
This is your home?

**Sasha**<br>
This is a house my grandfather left me.

**ConneR**<br>
Very tasteful interior decoration.

**Sasha**<br>
He is a native Node 13 person after all.<br>
Alright, enough with the chitchat. We haven't been in contact for years, ever since that day... Why are you contacting me now?

**ConneR**<br>
You only recently returned to Node 13, right? Before that, I really had no idea where you were.<br>
I read some of the ancient civilization research papers you published in recent years. That's why I felt you might just be the person who can help me.

**Sasha**<br>
Those should've all been published anonymously... Well, since it's you, it certainly wouldn't be difficult for you to find out.

**ConneR**<br>
Haha, I've been following you since our Academy days after all. I can recognize your writing style in just one quick glance. Nonetheless... going from undercover Law Enforcement Agent to ancient civilization research scholar; do you plan to go back to your 2nd career option?

**Sasha**<br>
Pretty much. Never imagined that after discarding those boring ideas, doing this would turn out to be so surprisingly enjoyable.

**ConneR**<br>
Boring ideas? You mean pursuing justice in this world or something along that line?

**Sasha**<br>
Haha, stop it. Right now, I... no longer think like that anymore.

**ConneR**<br>
No, what you're doing now is likely going to bring you even closer to that objective, as long as you partner up with me again.

**Sasha**<br>
... What do you mean?

**ConneR**<br>
I didn't simply come back to chat with an old friend. Didn't I mention that you're the person who can help me?

**Sasha**<br>
That depends on what the thing it is. I owe you a favor for the peaceful life I have now. Although I don't care about the legality of what you're going to do, I have no intention to get myself in trouble again.

**ConneR**<br>
All in all, hear me out first. I'll tell you the information I gathered and my speculations. I believe you'll definitely be interested.<br>
First, your research regarding Node 13's regional dialect should be much thorough than mine, correct? There are some data I would like you to take a look at.
