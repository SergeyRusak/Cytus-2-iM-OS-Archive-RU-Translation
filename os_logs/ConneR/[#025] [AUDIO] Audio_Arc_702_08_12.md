*\[Alarm goes off\]*

**Mark**<br>
Dr. Neumann, we just received the record of a malicious program's attempt to tamper with the encryption key index of Library's central database. After doing some reverse tracking, one of the attacking IP addresses came from the sub terminal in your office. 

**ConneR**<br>
What? There must be some kind of misunderstanding. I am not operating the terminal. 

**Mark**<br>
It might also be a mistake by the alarm system...

**ConneR**<br>
So the situation right now is...?

**Mark**<br>
You might have to go through the safety protocols. We'll handle the checking remotely. 

**ConneR**<br>
What a bother. Right in the middle of my work too...

*\[Scanning Device\]*

**Mark**<br>
Did doctor recently use any software or devices that came from unidentified sources? Due to your unique identity, you might be using equipment that is not supplied by A.R.C.   

**ConneR**<br>
Hmm... not really "unidentified" per say, but some projects use devices that were imported directly from my old lab. They might not meet A.R.C. standards. Does that count?

**Mark**<br>
... For insurance purposes, can doctor label these devices? We will send someone to check on them in a minute just to make sure.

**ConneR**<br>
No problem.

**Mark**<br>
Full scan complete. Seems that Doctor's sub terminal was just another randomly selected decoy.

**ConneR**<br>
Glad to hear that. Hope you guys can find the person behind all this soon.

**Mark**<br>
Thank you for your cooperation.
