　Had a few drinks today. Feel like everything sucks. How many people in this bogus world can hold on to a principle like me. Pioneers are always the ones to suffer; it's a common theme across history. It feels just like the time when I left that home to find my own reason for existence many years ago. 

　If I can leave something for this world, please allow me to cheer from the bottom of my hear and celebrate the arrival of humanity's freedom.
