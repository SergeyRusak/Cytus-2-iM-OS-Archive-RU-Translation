**Man A**<br>
Riya, I'm sorry...

**Man B**<br>
Never imagined that this would happen to Luka...

**Riya**<br>
Thank you... *\*Sobs\**...

**Man A**<br>
This really is too abrupt. He left behind you and your son just like this...

**Riya**<br>
It's that kind of job after all. To be honest, we're all mentally prepared for this sort of thing already. It just... came way too early...

**Raymond**<br>
Riya.

*\[Footsteps\]*

**Man B**<br>
Ah, captain Raymond.

**Riya**<br>
Captain...

**Raymond**<br>
For such an incident to happen to the exploration team during my term...<br>
I am truly, truly sorry.

**Riya**<br>
It's not captain's fault... but what exactly happened? From what I heard, the entire Wolf\-01 squad pretty much got wiped out with only a few survivors...

**Raymond**<br>
We're still figuring out the situation too. Once we reach a conclusion, I will inform you right away.

**Riya**<br>
Yes... thank you, captain...

**Raymond**<br>
Don't say that. Luka is one of my most outstanding subordinates. There really isn't much I can do for him... I have to give you guys a proper answer.

**Man A**<br>
Speaking of which... Captain, where's Colin? Why didn't we see his family today?

**Raymond**<br>
......

**Man B**<br>
Did you not hear about it? After he came back, Colin's mental condition appeared to be in a total mess. The higher\-ups let him go home to rest up first

**Man A**<br>
Mental condition!?

**Man B**<br>
Yep. He just kept mumbling nonsense, unable to properly report the ins and outs of the incident.

**Riya**<br>
That Colin...?

**Man A**<br>
... Damnit, this is Colin we're talking about, a man among men... Just what the hell happened to Wolf\-01 out there?

**Raymond**<br>
We figure that Colin suffered from extreme shock, which resulted in his current mindless state.<br>
We'll let him rest at home for a while. His wife and son will take care of him... This is for the sake of Luka too.

**Man A**<br>
But still, not even coming to the funeral... Isn't that a bit odd? He did only suffer minor injuries, right? He's not missing a limb or anything...

**Man B**<br>
Hmm, that's a good point. Luka is his closest friend and greatest rival too...

**Riya**<br>
It's okay. He is definitely very sad too... *\*Sobs\**...

**Raymond**<br>
All in all, my sincere condolences, Riya... If there's anything you need, please contact me. The exploration team will try their absolute best to help.

**Raymond**<br>
... Stop hiding, you brat.

**Sagar**<br>
......

**Raymond**<br>
Looks like you still recognize me... It's been years since I last saw you, yet you haven't grown one bit. Luka's so tall that my head can barely touch his shoulders.

**Sagar**<br>
*\*Sobs\**

**Raymond**<br>
... Of all the tough men I know, your father was the one that most closely resembles a wolf. He's agile, powerful and has that spark of wild instinct in his eyes... Yet even a man like him ended up losing his life outside.<br>
That's how dangerous the forbidden areas are.

**Sagar**<br>
......

**Raymond**<br>
You don't have the eyes of a wolf. Considering the risk, I won't ask you to follow in your father's footsteps... You just need to live safely inside Node, study and take good care of your mother.

**Raymond**<br>
However, if you're determined to see what's "beyond" these skies... your mother should know how to find me.

**Sagar**<br>
......

**Raymond**<br>
Farewell... son of Luka.

*\[Footsteps\]*

**Sagar**<br>
......

**Sagar**<br>
... Beyond... the sky...
