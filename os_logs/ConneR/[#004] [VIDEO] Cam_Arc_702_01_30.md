**Sagar**<br>
Hello, Dr. Neumann. Didn't have the chance to introduce myself last time. I'm...

**ConneR**<br>
Mr. Sagar, A.R.C.'s top exploration team captain. I thought I'd never see you again.

**Sagar**<br>
Haha, you really do know everything. <br>
I've heard about the bureau's progress. Since you had no intention to cooperate during the interrogation, the judgment is not looking good... 

**ConneR**<br>
You mean those two young fowls? They call that "Interrogation"... My, my. Too young, too naive. 

**Sagar**<br>
Doctor, I'm not kidding. You might be sentenced to life in prison this time.

**ConneR**<br>
*\*Chuckles\** With their current level of technological understanding, if the admins really want to try and imprison me...

*\[Handcuffs Unlock\]*

**ConneR**<br>
they have to try harder.

**Sagar**<br>
My God! Doctor! What are you doing? There are cameras around here. Put it back!

**Sagar**<br>
How in the world did you...

**ConneR**<br>
These types of electronic cuffs was designed in the past for lightweight criminals in the slums. It works based on the bio waves emitted from the skin. Right now, my entire right arm is machine. All I did was mess with the cuffs on my left arm a little, and voil√†.<br>
Be it the admins or A.R.C., they are simply using technology while having no idea how it works. 

**Sagar**<br>
... Doctor, are you planning to break out of prison...?

**ConneR**<br>
I've said it before. We citizens have no obligation to follow any law that was established after humans took over as admins. I will not accept my arrest on such fabricated charges.

**Sagar**<br>
You really are a man of principles, just like the rumors said.<br>
To be honest with you, I came here to make you a deal. It may free you from your current criminal charges and punishments. 

**ConneR**<br>
I guessed as much. 

**Sagar**<br>
Huh?

**ConneR**<br>
*\*Chuckles\** I can crack this piece of junk handcuffs with my eyes closed. What makes you think that I willingly stayed in this dump for several days? You came to try and persuade me to join A.R.C.'s research, am I right?

**Sagar**<br>
Haha... you really did predict everything. I expect no less from the Doctor.<br>
Actually, the person who came up with this proposal was me. There are plenty of people at A.R.C. who have a deep level of respect for you; I am one of them. We feel that you don't deserve to be locked up like this. 

**ConneR**<br>
I won't be anyway.

**Sagar**<br>
Doctor, join us! As a representative of A.R.C., I officially invite you to join us as an advisor. With that position, you can participate in any project we have here. Be it research or exploration, there should be a place for you to display your talents. 

**ConneR**<br>
Sure.

**Sagar**<br>
Please give it a solid consideration... EH? Did you just say "Sure"?

**ConneR**<br>
Yes. Joining A.R.C. was part of my plans anyway. I'm very interested in that "thing" you guys built in the sky and what's stored in it. Never imagined that I would get my opportunity in this fashion though.

**Sagar**<br>
The higher\-ups told me "No f\*\*\*ing way", but I decided to give it a try nonetheless. I'm so glad that you agreed!<br>
With your academic knowledge and field experience, combined with the resources and talents at A.R.C. HQ, I believe you won't be disappointed.

**ConneR**<br>
*\*Chuckles\** I don't necessarily agree with the "talent" part, but we'll see about it. 

**Sagar**<br>
Anyway, thank you so much! Later today, we will have our agents deal with all the registration and documents. Tomorrow morning, someone will take you to the presentation center to listen to the newcomer's guide. <br>
Oh, and please put the handcuffs back on. You're putting me in a very awkward situation...
