**Raven**<br>
Colin Neumann Jr. We're from Node 08's Administration Bureau...

**ConneR**<br>
No need for introductions. Just tell me why you're here.

**Raven**<br>
I am Raven, law enforcement agent from Node 08 Administration Bureau. This is my partner, Hawk.

**Hawk**<br>
We always knew that you have been visiting the forbidden areas and conducting illegal explorations behind the bureau's back. Here's a record of the violations you were charged with by the bureau in the past decade...

**ConneR**<br>
Raven and Hawk... did your brain hurt figuring out those codenames...

**Hawk**<br>
You got a problem with our names!? You better watch your mouth...

**Raven**<br>
We would like to question you about the recent incident in Ruins N13A448. I hope you can comply. This conversation is being recorded.

**ConneR**<br>
I have to clarify my stance. We citizens have no obligation to follow any law that was established after A.R.C. and humans took over as admins. Therefore the term "illegal" is quite... inappropriate.  

**Raven**<br>
Are you finding an excuse for your various crimes? If you want a reminder, that includes illegal trespassing into the forbidden areas, encroachment of public property within Ruins and resisting arrest from Administration Bureau officers, among a long list of others.

**ConneR**<br>
No, I'm serious, boy. I have my rules when I operate and these rules are built on core beliefs. The only thing that bothers me is that you can't force others to accept your belief.

**Hawk**<br>
Easier said than done!

**ConneR**<br>
You have to believe me, young fowls. What I am doing is for the sake of you people.

**Hawk**<br>
What did you just say!?

**Raven**<br>
Hawk, calm down.<br>
Dr. Neumann, can we talk about what happened to your right arm?

**ConneR**<br>
Even though my memory is still a bit blurry, I told everything to the people that gave me emergency treatment back at the accident site. I believe the medical drones captured every single word I spoke. I don't want to repeat myself. 

*\[Drinks Tea\]*

**Hawk**<br>
Mr. Neumann! Right now you're a criminal with multiple serious charges! I advise that you watch your attitude!

*\[Cup Shatters\]*

**Raven**<br>
Hawk! Stand down! The hard way doesn't work with this guy.

**ConneR**<br>
You two have quite the teamwork. Are we doing the full good cop/bad cop routine now?

**Hawk**<br>
What the hell is a "cop"?

**Raven**<br>
It's what civilians called law enforcement agents in the past. This guy is a complete professional when it comes to things of the past.

**ConneR**<br>
All in all, I don't have anything new to tell you people. Everything is in the records. You guys can now go and report back to your superiors.

**Hawk**<br>
Your punishment will be issued very soon. We'll see then!

**Raven**<br>
I will report this to the bureau. It seems that you've run out of tricks this time. I'm sorry. 

**ConneR**<br>
Farewell, young fowls.
