**Sagar**<br>
Doctor, you're doing rehab?

**ConneR**<br>
Ah, Mr. Sagar. Good afternoon.

**Sagar**<br>
As expected from doctor. Writing is the most efficient way to improve the compatibility of a prosthetic arm. <br>
How does your body feel?

**ConneR**<br>
Still need some time to adjust. If possible, I would like to practice playing some instruments as well.

**Sagar**<br>
I know doctor lived in Node 13 for a while and left many personal items back there. If there is the need, I can file an application to get someone to move it here, including your instruments.

**ConneR**<br>
That would be great. You have my gratitude.

**Sagar**<br>
... Doctor, you are not as difficult as I imagine. From what I've heard, you're supposed to be unapproachable and bad\-tempered. In reality, you're a very kind and soft\-spoken gentleman.

**ConneR**<br>
What I loathe are the admins and the higher\-ups in the A.R.C. committee. What's the point of getting mad at you? As an exploration captain, you saved my life and made me a deal that spared me from imprisonment. I should be respectful and thankful to you.

**Sagar**<br>
Don't say that doctor. I really don't deserve such politeness from you.

**ConneR**<br>
Being well\-mannered is a proud tradition of the Neumann family. I'm more surprised by you. I'm technically a criminal to you people, yet you don't seem to show any distaste when you're around me.

**Sagar**<br>
Personally, I feel that doctor's contributions to archeology and exploration technology cannot be judged with traditional legal concepts. I originally wanted to pursue a career in archeology too, but I've always been a "brawn over brains" type of person. My physical ability is far superior to its intellectual counterpart, so doing exploration became my only option. People like Dr. Neumann, who are both physically and intellectually capable, are like gods to us!

**ConneR**<br>
Young fella, there are no "gods" in this world. There are plenty of "humans" pretending to be gods though, so I would prefer if you don't call me that.

**Sagar**<br>
Sorry. Just want to tell you that I really look up to you.

**ConneR**<br>
Thank you. <br>
By the way, I believe that A.R.C. and the admins can simultaneously see what my right eye sees. Am I right?

**Sagar**<br>
Heck no! Back then, we were working our asses off trying to save you. We don't have the spare time to perform such cheap tricks. I was there in person, trust me!

**ConneR**<br>
... Alright. Still, doesn't hide the fact that it makes me quite uncomfortable... can I cover it up?

**Sagar**<br>
Eh? It should be fine... but you're lucky to recover your sight. Are you just going to throw it away like that?

**ConneR**<br>
It's more of an issue of principle. I have my doubts about a world viewed through the eye of a machine. Therefore, I'd rather not use it.
