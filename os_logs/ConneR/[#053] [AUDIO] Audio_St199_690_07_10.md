**Member A**<br>
The goods?

**Sasha**<br>
They're here. Don't worry. The hacker is cracking the last set of serial numbers.

**Member B**<br>
I've heard about it. You guys got that "X" to do the job, right? We know his interests and origin, don't play tricks with us.

**Sasha**<br>
Ha, you offer this kind of money and you think that buys you the right to talk? If you're scared, I'll find somebody else to sell it to.

**Member C**<br>
What did you say!?

**Member A**<br>
Hey, forget it.

**Member C**<br>
Tch...

**ConneR**<br>
The final set of serial numbers has been decrypted. The data is all yours.

Got it.

R! Listen to me, you can escape through the small door in the front. No one should be there, you...!?

Damnit! It was you, wasn't it!? The one who shot the captain...

**Sasha**<br>

**Agent A**<br>
Don't believe her! She's the master deceiver Shark. It's not difficult for her to get her hands on this kind of info.

**Sasha**<br>
... Ugh!

**Agent C**<br>
Where's your partner?

**Sasha**<br>
......

**Agent C**<br>
What about the data? Did he take it?

**Sasha**<br>
... I don't know.

**Agent C**<br>
You don't want to talk? So you're with them after all? We'll have a lot more time to open your mouth back at the Bureau.
