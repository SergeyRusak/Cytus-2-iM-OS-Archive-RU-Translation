    Although it's because of a freak accident, I've been in A.R.C. HQ for over half a year now. Ironically, they are half the reason why I am still alive. But now, look at me; not only did I make a successful comeback on my first concert, garnering applause and praise, but I'm also using their resources to try to take down the order they are maintaining. No, more like trying to reveal the truth they are hiding. Should I congratulate myself for being such a great schemer, or should I say "Destiny brought me here"?

   From the real report I obtained from Rin, the chip father left me is a device that can fuse with the cranial nerves of humans. I've studied father's disease and the symptoms he is displaying right now; the two have no connections whatsoever. Can't rule out the possibility that father is in his current state due to using himself as a test subject. 

   If this chip really contains the important message that has been passed down through the Neumann family history, I have to find a way to extract the data from it.
