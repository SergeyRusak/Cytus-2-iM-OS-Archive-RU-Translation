**Colin**<br>
Wake up.

**ConneR**<br>
... Ugh...

**Colin**<br>
Wake up, son.

**ConneR**<br>
Five more minutes...

*\[Door Opens\]*

**ConneR**<br>
... Uhhh... Okay, I'm up...

**Colin**<br>
Finally awake? You overslept for five minutes.

**ConneR**<br>
... I'm sorry...

**Colin**<br>
Laziness corrupts the skills and weakens the mind. You are a member of the Neumann family. You are required to be in peak condition at all times... I will not allow you to bring shame upon our ancestors.

**ConneR**<br>
Yes. I won't commit the same mistake again, father.

**Colin**<br>
... Don't do it again. Go to the stables now. You have twenty\-five minutes to prepare for your morning practice.

**ConneR**<br>
I'll go right away!

*[»»» Fast Forward 2 hours»»»]*

**ConneR**<br>
Father, mother, good morning.

**Alyxia**<br>
You must be hungry, right? Here's your breakfast.

**ConneR**<br>
Yes, mother... Ah, thank you, Grace! It looks delicious!

**Grace**<br>
*\*Chuckles\** I'm flattered. Enjoy your meal, young master.<br>
Sir, Madam, do you want some more tea?

**Colin**<br>
I'm good. You can leave to take a break now.

**Grace**<br>
Understood. Thank you, sir.

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Colin**<br>
... Your table manners are not refined enough.

**ConneR**<br>
I, I'm sorry, father.

**Alyxia**<br>
It's not a big deal. It's not like we have any guests now.

**Colin**<br>
No good. One's everyday manners are a showcase of one's personality traits. Neglect is the beginning of all failures.

**Alyxia**<br>
Yeah, yeah... Speaking of which, it's a holiday. You should sleep until you wake up naturally. It's not a big deal to skip just one morning practice...

**Colin**<br>
Don't spoil him too much, Alyxia.

**ConneR**<br>
Mother, I'm fine! Some physical activity in the morning gives me more energy as well!

**Alyxia**<br>
Good boy. You really do work hard... Could it be, that you want to follow your father's footsteps and become a member of the exploration team?

**ConneR**<br>
Yes!... If I can...

**Colin**<br>
The exploration team consists of well\-rounded elites. Be it strength, knowledge, or intelligence, only the best of the best are allowed to join. With your performance right now, you won't even make it past the written test.

**ConneR**<br>
......

**Colin**<br>
If you truly want to be a member of the exploration team, you'll have to replace them, surpass yourself... You know very well what you should do, son.

**ConneR**<br>
Yes! I will work even harder... to become someone as outstanding as father!

**Colin**<br>
... Then prove it to me with your actions.

**ConneR**<br>
Understood! Mother, I'll be leaving first to study in my room!

**Alyxia**<br>
Is that really enough for you? Should I ask Grace to make you some more?

**ConneR**<br>
It's okay!<br>
I'm full!

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Alyxia**<br>
You... Sigh, why do you always have to be so strict?

**Colin**<br>
At his current level, he won't be able to join the exploration team. That's a fact. Sugarcoating the facts and giving him false consolation is not my style.

**Alyxia**<br>
But he is capable of doing it, right?

**Colin**<br>
... Which is why I try my absolute best to provide him with the best in everything.

**Alyxia**<br>
Just as I expected... But he's been working so hard, yet you don't even give him a single compliment. You just keep wanting him to be like you...

**Colin**<br>
You're wrong, Alyxia. I don't want him to be like me.

**Alyxia**<br>
Huh?

**Colin**<br>
Colin Neumann Jr. The person who inherited my name will definitely not stop here... The Neumann family fell from glory in the past. It was me who brought this name back to the ranks of the elite, and I believe that my son can do even better than me. I am absolutely certain that he will surpass my achievements.

**Colin**<br>
He is my hope... I earnestly look forward to the arrival of that day.

*[→Signal Switches]*

**ConneR**<br>
... I will, father.
