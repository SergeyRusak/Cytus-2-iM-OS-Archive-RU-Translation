## Log Content
**Nancy**<br>
Hello, Doc. Getting coffee by yourself again today?

**ConneR**<br>
As usual. One glass of Cold\-Brew Irish Coffee.

*\[Coffee Machine operating\]*

**Nancy**<br>
Here's your Irish Coffee. We switched to a different brand of whiskey this week. See if you can taste any notable difference.

**ConneR**<br>
Hmm... the alcohol tastes a bit stronger than before, but I like this taste.

**Shinshima**<br>
Hey man! Rare seeing yours truly grab a drink now. Aren't you busy with running analysis on the latest test statistics?

**ConneR**<br>
Professor Shinshima, the fact that I am running stat analysis is precisely the reason I have some time to sneak in here for a break.

**Nancy**<br>
Rare? You serious? Doc has been visiting us at this exact time for a whole week now!

**ConneR**<br>
A while ago, there was a batch of data that need the central database's calculating capabilities to do the analysis. That was a lot more tiring; had to make several trips myself.

**Shinshima**<br>
You should be hiring a few more assistants.

**ConneR**<br>
Haha. On a side note, Professor Shinshima. I recall you mentioning before that you came from Node 15, right?

**Shinshima**<br>
Correct. It's one of the few Nodes that was built on giant islands. It has scenery that you can never see here in Node 08.

**ConneR**<br>
Have you ever been to Node 13 after you began studying recreated technologies? I stayed there for quite some time. The unique culture and traditions make it a bit difficult for me to fully blend in, but I still really enjoyed my stay there.

**Shinshima**<br>
Unfortunately, I moved directly to Node 08 with my family after I was hired by A.R.C. I didn't have too much time to stay at other Nodes for an extensive time. As you may know, applying for cross\-node traveling is not exactly easy.

**ConneR**<br>
I see... what a pity. How about Node 03? When I was searching for data, I discovered that incidents of "Architects" attacking humans were once quite common there. Due to some personal reasons, I'm quite interested in things like this.

**Shinshima**<br>
I've been there a few times for vacation, but I have no ideas about the incidents you mentioned. Maybe you can try asking the locals?

**ConneR**<br>
None of my project team members are from Node 03. How about Professor Shinshima's team?

**Shinshima**<br>
Hmm... no one in my lab really comes to mind. I'm sorry. If I get the chance, I'll help you find someone.

**Nancy**<br>
If you are looking for someone who grew up in Node 03 and has a deep understanding of its history, I know a person who meets that criteria!

**ConneR**<br>
Oh? A regular here?

**Nancy**<br>
Not really... It's a shy female researcher. She specializes in the analysis of recreated technology. Doc should be familiar with her partner; it's Sagar from the exploration team.

**ConneR**<br>
Sagar? Never heard him mention such a person.

**Nancy**<br>
She usually comes here herself only when it's late night or early morning. Other times, she would ask us to deliver the order to her lab.

**ConneR**<br>
Her lab number is...?

**Nancy**<br>
Room C3101, in the central database area. That room is quite hard to find, so you may need to ask those who work there. The name's "Rin".

**Shinshima**<br>
You can also bring your data with you there while you're at it. 

**ConneR**<br>
Thank you so much. I really appreciate your help.
