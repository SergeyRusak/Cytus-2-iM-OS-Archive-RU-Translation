... I can do it myself. It's just a tiny wound...

**ConneR**<br>
You can't properly bandage yourself from this angle. Let me do it.

**???**<br>
Don't you dare use this chance to feel me up.

**ConneR**<br>
I won't do that! Well then... please excuse me.

**???**<br>
Ah! Ow.... ow...

![cos4401.png](./attachments/cos4401.png)

**ConneR**<br>
... Did... a law enforcement agent do this?

**???**<br>
Yep... I thought things were going smoothly. Was a really well\-concealed transaction too... Where exactly did the info leak? Damnit...

**ConneR**<br>
......

**???**<br>
... First time seeing a gunshot wound?

**ConneR**<br>
Umm... if it's from this distance... Yeah, it's a first.

**???**<br>
*\*Chuckles\**. If you want to survive in this business, you better be careful yourself too. Maybe one day this hole will be on you instead.

**ConneR**<br>
Eh...? No, I'm just a normal civilian...

**???**<br>
Hmph, don't play dumb. I saw the martini on the table. You're also one of "us", aren't you? You suck at lying, and that's a terrible weakness to have in this world.

**ConneR**<br>
......<br>
Your wounds are dressed. Please don't move around too much for now.

**???**<br>
Ho? You're quite clever with your hands. Thanks.<br>
The thing you hid just now, it's something from A.R.C., isn't it? Can you let me take a look?

**ConneR**<br>
......

**???**<br>
No need to be so cautious. Judging by how refined you look, you don't seem like a gunman or hitman... You're probably more of an information broker or a deceiver. I'm good at sizing people up. If that's really what you are, consider me your senior.

**ConneR**<br>
Deceive...

**???**<br>
Buyer? Seller? You look like a fawn who wandered into a pack of wolves without realizing it. I may be able to give you some advice. Show it to me. It's not like we can leave this place any time soon either.

**ConneR**<br>
I'm a seller... I don't mind showing it to you since I can't decrypt this data either. The buyer offered a good price, and I just so happen to have a way to obtain it.

*\[Load data\]*

**???**<br>
This serial number... how did you get your hands on this stuff!?

**ConneR**<br>
Ummm... trade secrets.

**???**<br>
Interesting... How much is the buyer paying?

**ConneR**<br>
... (Whispers)

**???**<br>
Hahahaha! And you call that a "good price"? Are you kidding me!?<br>
Lemme tell you... you got conned.

**ConneR**<br>
EH?

**???**<br>
This is a level 4 encryption of A.R.C. The undecrypted data alone can easily get you at least ten... no, twenty times the price if you sell it on the market.

**ConneR**<br>
For real!?

**???**<br>
You really are completely oblivious... How the hell did you get yourself into this business... <br>
Nevertheless, judging by the fact that you're able to obtain this piece of data, guess it's safe to conclude that you're somewhat capable.

**ConneR**<br>
This is just a small part of the whole thing too... I can't steal all the data at once. However, if it's one small package at a time...

**???**<br>
Stop right\~ there! <br>
Lesson 1: Never blurt out information without the other person asking first. Seriously, just how gullible are you?

**ConneR**<br>
......!<br>
Umm... I could be telling a lie...

**???**<br>
Lesson 2: Bluffing is utterly useless if you are not certain the amount of information the other person has.<br>
What you said is true. Area 09, right? I heard rumors about this stuff on the market. From the serial number and transfer protocol, I can easily tell that this baby here is the real deal.

**ConneR**<br>
......!

**???**<br>
According to the rumors, A.R.C. hid a ton of files in that server block. All stuff they don't want the public to see. <br>
Nobody knows what the actual content in those files is. Both the connection and physical security of that block are extremely tight. As of now, not a single soul has successfully infiltrated it. 

**???**<br>
Yet a pretty boy like you somehow managed to obtain a part of that data... Don't you find that intriguing?

**ConneR**<br>
......

**???**<br>
Excellent... I can smell the money.<br>
I'm "Sasha", a professional deceiver.<br>
What do you say? Wanna work together with me?

**ConneR**<br>
You certainly look very experienced... But with how messy you look right now, I presume you just failed a transaction? I find it hard to believe that...

**Sasha**<br>
Haha, what do you think is in these two cases? One of them contains the goods. The other one contains the money. Do you understand? In a busted transaction, I was able to get my hands on both and leave the other person with nothing. Although I did get shot a few times...

**ConneR**<br>
......

**Sasha**<br>
Abandon your original buyer. I can guarantee you that they offered you such a s\*\*\*\*\* price because they saw you as an idiot who knows nothing. Trust me. Setting aside how you get your hands on that data, I can get you more value for your abilities on the market hands down.<br>
You got into this business 'cause you need the money too, right?

**ConneR**<br>
... Alright. I will trust you, temporarily that is.

**Sasha**<br>
"Temporarily" eh... how cold. Ah, one more thing. I don't know your name yet.

**ConneR**<br>
... "Colin".

**Sasha**<br>
Colin... What a weird codename. I already have a basic concept of this plan in my mind.<br>
Come to this address at 3 P.M. tomorrow.

**ConneR**<br>
This place is...?

**Sasha**<br>
One of my "offices". We'll discuss the details there.<br>
I look forward to our partnership. Let's start from zero... Partners?

*\[High Five\]*

**ConneR**<br>
... Partners.
