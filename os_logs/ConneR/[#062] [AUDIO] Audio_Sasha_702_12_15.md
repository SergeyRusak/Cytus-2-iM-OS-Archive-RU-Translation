*\[Door Knock\]*

**Sasha**<br>
R? I'm coming in?

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Sasha**<br>
R......?

**ConneR**<br>
......zzZ

**Sasha**<br>
He fell asleep... Falling asleep while sitting on a chair, holding a violin... Is he a child or something...

*\[Covers\]*

**ConneR**<br>
... Sasha, you're here? Sorry...

**Sasha**<br>
... I don't use that name anymore.

**ConneR**<br>
It's the name I know you by. Please, let me call you that.

**Sasha**<br>
*\*Sigh\**... do as you wish. How about you take a quick break? You haven't slept in days.

**ConneR**<br>
Can't... there are still two tests running. How's the progress with the document restoration?

**Sasha**<br>
Even for someone like me, the 70% we have now is about as good as it can get. Give me some more time.

**ConneR**<br>
I've already tested all the combinations in 70% of the documents. Still couldn't read the content of the chip. If these last two sets fail as well...

**Sasha**<br>
I can kind of understand what your father felt now.

**ConneR**<br>
*\*Chuckles\** Don't be silly. Unlike father, I'm not going to be defeated by this setback. Besides, he spent his entire life on this research. I figured it's very unlikely that we get any major breakthrough in just a few days.

**Sasha**<br>
That being said, you certainly look very tired.

**ConneR**<br>
I feel much better after seeing you.

**Sasha**<br>
Oh, is that so?<br>
Ah, enough with the long face. I'm here to inform you of some good news. Although... well, it's not exactly total good news... it's about the investigation into the message on the wall.

**ConneR**<br>
"Sound of the Heart" is it?

**Sasha**<br>
Yep. While you were working your a\*\* off these past few days, I was busy with my own investigations, though I've only made limited progress... I was able to find it in the library in 13. This is very likely a secret code used by some sort of organization. The phrase before it is "Core of the Azure".

**Sasha**<br>
When my search went nowhere, I began to go through music books from that era. I accidentally came across several books of which Rald is credited as the author. Take a look; these books all have a hidden layer inside their cover.

**Sasha**<br>
Inside the layer is a piece of sheet music with just a single note. The note on this one is a half note with the tag "Core of the Azure". Then, you'd find another half note in another book and combine them to create a complete measure. The tag on that one would be "Sound of the Heart". Judging by the rest and the tags on the notes, these pieces of sheet music can all match into pairs.

**ConneR**<br>
"Core of the Azure; Sound of the Heart"... Still can't understand what it means...<br>


**Sasha**<br>
My instincts tell me... this is probably utilized by the organization as a way to confirm identities and conduct regular operations.

*\[Books falling\]*

**ConneR**<br>
Uhh, sorry... what an embarrassment.

**Sasha**<br>
I told you that you're very tired. Go get some slee... eh...?<br>
Wait a second. Don't pick them up yet.

**ConneR**<br>
......?<br>
What are you doing?

**Sasha**<br>
If we stack these books accordingly to their chapter numbers like this... the first letter of the titles...<br>
A, N, T, I, T, E, C, H...

**ConneR**<br>
"Anti\-tech"...? I see. This organization was an anti\-technology organization back then. And this is their secret code for their operations? However, what kind of operation would require such a rigorous hiding process...?

**Sasha**<br>
Does this also represent the fact that your ancestors were related to this organization...?<br>
R... When I was investigating this in the library, I discovered some bizarre things.

**ConneR**<br>
Bizarre?

**Sasha**<br>
In the library, almost every single document and book that was written around the time of The Decommission has clear signs of missing pages.

**ConneR**<br>
......<br>
I'm not surprised. Ever since The Decommission, Node 13 stopped using any and all technology products. Therefore, all data afterward was stored via paper documents, and that just so happened to be exactly what A.R.C. wanted. I'm quite certain that they're responsible for this...

**Sasha**<br>
So this is the extent they're willing to go to...? Not even the data and history of other Nodes are spared...<br>
Sorry, so far, this is all I could obtain.

**ConneR**<br>
No, you did a great job. Thanks for the hard work. The secrets of history are right within our grasp...<br>
Our first priority right now is still the content of the chip. Perhaps the answer lies within it...

**[Operating System]**<br>
*Analysis complete. Unable to read.*

**ConneR**<br>
Damn it... so even these last two sets don't work...?

**Sasha**<br>
I'll work hard on the remaining documents. You should...

**ConneR**<br>
Sasha, I'm entering the chip myself.

**Sasha**<br>
... Eh?

**ConneR**<br>
As with the method, I've already more or less completed the research on that. Let's proceed with it tomorrow.

**Sasha**<br>
......

**ConneR**<br>
Rest assured. I won't repeat the same mistakes as my father.

**Sasha**<br>
... Why are you so certain about that?

**ConneR**<br>
I found a few errors in father's algorithms when I looked through this data, and I resolved them. Despite that, it seems that machines made with the current technology level can't accept these new algorithms.

**ConneR**<br>
Father chose to use the virtual internet chip at the very end because the entire virtual internet is a cloned product of the technology A.R.C. excavated from inside Library. And inside Library...

**Sasha**<br>
......

**ConneR**<br>
By the time he conducted this experiment, his mental state was already an utter mess. In contrast, with the state I am in now... perhaps there's a chance.

**Sasha**<br>
R, the risk of this is way too high.

**ConneR**<br>
Indeed. Therefore, will you be willing to accompany me?

**Sasha**<br>
