**Grace**<br>
Hello, Neumann residence, how may I... Huh!? Master Colin!

**ConneR**<br>
Grace, it's been a while.

**Grace**<br>
Just a moment please. I'll open the gates for you right now!

*\[Gate Opens\]*

**Grace**<br>
Master! You finally came back!

**ConneR**<br>
The hugs can wait; let me put my stuff down first... Woah, why are you crying? Are you that touched?

**Grace**<br>
Apologies. I'll take your luggage to your room. Everything is pretty much in the place where you left them. 

**ConneR**<br>
Thank you. How's father doing?

**Grace**<br>
Sir is... he's fine, but I think you might have to take a look yourself.

**ConneR**<br>
What's the matter?

*[»»» Fast Forward »»»]*

**ConneR**<br>
... Father?

**Colin**<br>
......

**ConneR**<br>
... Just what in the world happened?

**Grace**<br>
After you left home, Sir began to lock himself in the workshop for days on end on a regular basis. At first, he still ate the food I placed in front of his door. Until one day, I discovered that the food hasn't been touched in a while. I broke into the room, only to find him collapsed among messy piles of data and pieces of equipment...

**ConneR**<br>
... And he has been in this state ever since?

**Grace**<br>
Yes... He still performs eating motions when I feed him, but that's it. He has no reaction to everything else. He just keeps staring into nothingness like he has no soul. The doctors can't identify what's wrong with him either...

**ConneR**<br>
... Father, it's me.

**Colin**<br>
......

**ConneR**<br>
Father!

**Grace**<br>
Apologies. I thought he would have some reaction after seeing you. Doesn't seem like it...<br>
Master! I'm so sorry. It's... *\*sniff\**... all my fault. If I had taken a better care of Sir, he wouldn't...

**ConneR**<br>
Don't apologize. I should have come back earlier. I was too obsessed with my own achievements... Looks like I don't even have the chance to show off to him anymore... 

**Grace**<br>
Master...

**ConneR**<br>
... I'm fine. Let me take a look at father's workshop...

*[»»» Fast Forward »»» ]*

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Grace**<br>
Apologies. I don't know where to start organizing all this complicated stuff.

**ConneR**<br>
Don't mind. Just keep it this way.

**Grace**<br>
Ah yes. Sir was holding this in his hand when I found him... There's also a letter on the desk; I believe it's addressed to you.

**ConneR**<br>
It's the Neumann family chip...
