**Sasha**<br>
... I remember now. That guy who was always right behind me and kept getting second place... Turns out that was you.

**ConneR**<br>
My, I was so young and naive back then. I originally thought that if I can beat you in a test, I can grab your attention. Yet when I finally got that 1st place, it was because you left.

**ConneR**<br>
Back then, when I was at my most helpless and despaired, when I was hiding in a dark corner, seeing you work so hard as the model student, seeing your determined eyes... I don't know why, but it gave my life undescribable courage and an objective to chase. It without a doubt pulled me out of the terrible state I was in. To you, who have never even met me in person, this is probably very difficult to understand.

**Sasha**<br>
... So that's why you wanted me to get my life back... and you even killed captain... Stop screwing around with me... Acting like some kind of savior for this reason... Do I look that pathetic in your eyes!?

**ConneR**<br>
First, I did not kill the captain. I would even go as far as to say that his death caught me by complete surprise... Second, even if he didn't die, you already knew what's going to happen, don't you? He's never going to return your identity as a Law Enforcement Agent, even after this mission concluded.

**Sasha**<br>
......

**ConneR**<br>
The Infiltration Plan and the ecosystem of the Administration Bureau, I believe you know them much better than me. Once you lose possession of this data, your only option is to rely on him, all the while being stuck in this incompetent system and barely staying afloat. You will be forced to watch helplessly as more and more comrades perish.

**Sasha**<br>
......

**ConneR**<br>
Amanda, Leon, Coral; these names won't be the end of this trail of blood. Perhaps the name Zoe will eventually join them at the end of this trail as well.

**Sasha**<br>
... Shut up...

**ConneR**<br>
When that time arrives, I will appear in front of you once again and ask you the same question: Is this really the life you want? Or have you been a deceiver for long that you ended up fooling yourself too?

**Sasha**<br>
...... Shut up!

**ConneR**<br>
If I don't give you a reason and excuse like this, you'll be fine with things staying as the status quo? If that's really the case, then yes, you are indeed pathetic.

*\[Loads Gun\]*

**Sasha**<br>
... ENOUGH! I told you to shut up! How dare you speak like you understand everything! You don't...

**ConneR**<br>
You're right. I don't understand. Nevertheless, you were without a doubt once a sublime figure in my mind; or perhaps that's just an image of you I created myself and hoped you could be. However, once I have a person I admire, I can't stand even one tiny bit of smudge on her. I won't allow her to selfishly ruin her place in my heart... Because to me, that is more painful than anything else.

**Sasha**<br>
......

**ConneR**<br>
If this is all my misunderstanding, please, go ahead and pull the trigger. Take back the data. Take back your own identity.

**ConneR**<br>
After all, I am well aware that what I am doing now is purely based on my wishful thinking. I am foolishly doing what I believe is the right thing to do in this s\*\*\*hole world where justice doesn't exist anywhere. That's all.

**Sasha**<br>
... Ugh...!

**ConneR**<br>
Dying at your hands... That's not too bad of an ending for me either.

**Sasha**<br>
......

*\[Retracts gun\]*

**ConneR**<br>
......

**Sasha**<br>
... Captain Wood... I know that he was only using me all this time. He's definitely not the model Law Enforcement Agent I envisioned too...  But even so, he still taught me a lot of things and helped me a great deal... At the very least, he is not someone who should've died for this.

**ConneR**<br>
I am very sorry to hear that. But you know very well yourself, don't you? No matter which side you're on...

**Sasha**<br>
The justice and peace I dream about are nowhere to be seen.

**Sasha**<br>
......

**ConneR**<br>
......

**Sasha**<br>
... Node 10... what kind of place is it?

**ConneR**<br>
"Deserted" and "Desolate" are words created to describe that place.
