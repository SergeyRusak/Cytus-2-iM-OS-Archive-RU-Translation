**ConneR**<br>
So? Any thoughts?

**Sasha**<br>
... Looks like the case you got involved in this time is truly a significant one, is it?

**ConneR**<br>
The use of the word "involved" is approximately 50% accurate in this situation.

**Sasha**<br>
How so?

**ConneR**<br>
At first, I started investigating this series of events out of personal interest. However, when I dug deeper and deeper, I discovered that the truth and I... no, and "us" were more and more connected to each other.

**Sasha**<br>
Us...? Does it have something to do with me?

**ConneR**<br>
No, not just the two of us... I was referring to all of us.

**Sasha**<br>
......?

**ConneR**<br>
Father and Co.—— the incident encountered by the last generation of exploration elites, the large\-scale internet terrorist attacks headlined by Æsir, the lies made up by A.R.C. out of desperation to hide the truth, "The Decommission"... They may bring about humanity's greatest catastrophe since then.

**Sasha**<br>
... Is that so? Based on the clues you currently have right now, this speculation is quite a bit of a stretch.

**ConneR**<br>
Indeed, which is why I would like to get your take on this. After all, your instincts have always been much more on point than mine. I believe you.

**Sasha**<br>
*\*Chuckles\** Man, your every word... I'm having trouble determining whether you're praising me or teasing me.

**ConneR**<br>
I say about half\-and\-half. So, any thoughts?

**Sasha**<br>
Sigh...For starters, let's organize everything. First, these are your father's research documents, all in paper documents... They're in pretty bad shape. Some of them even got burnt...

**ConneR**<br>
Yes, my father was in a really unstable mental state before his passing. Even though I really don't want to admit that those rumors outside were correct... by that time, he had, without a doubt, gone insane.

**Sasha**<br>
I'm sorry to hear that... There's also the phrase he left on the wall. According to a direct translation of Node 13's dialect —— "XXX; Sound of the Heart" is what it says.

**ConneR**<br>
Even someone of my level knows that much but knowing the words didn't bring me any closer to understanding what they mean.

**Sasha**<br>
It feels like some kind of secret code or phrase... I can look into it to see if any related organizations used these words.<br>
Next is this chip he left you. Any idea what it is? I've never seen this model...

**ConneR**<br>
So far, the only things I know are —— <br>
Number one, my father spent much of his life studying it. At first, it was for his own fame and glory. That was until he lost his teammates. Afterward, he became more and more obsessed with it. Regardless of all that, he was never able to find an answer before he passed away.

**ConneR**<br>
Number two, this item is a relic of technology from ancient civilization. It has been passed down from my ancestors —— from the era of Rald Neumann... In other words, this thing has been passed down from the time of "The Decommission".

**Sasha**<br>
That info I already know. Anything else?

**ConneR**<br>
Number three, this could be a technology created by the Architects, which is precisely one of the many truths A.R.C. has been trying diligently to hide all this time.

**Sasha**<br>
......!?<br>
Architects aren't supposed to do this kind of thing.

**ConneR**<br>
This is the lie A.R.C. wants to fabricate. How much do you know about Architects?

**Sasha**<br>
Umm... some things here and there; but judging by how much you've changed... perhaps not as much as you.

**ConneR**<br>
Before father died, he was diagnosed with a disease called "neurodegenerative dementia", which took away his ability to move and normal cognitive functions. My research into medicine barely scratches the surface, but I know that his symptoms are absolutely different than that disease.

**Sasha**<br>
......

**ConneR**<br>
The doctor who made the diagnosis was sent by A.R.C. and has been treating him ever since he "resigned" from the company. His trustworthiness is about as low as it gets.

**ConneR**<br>
Before he passed away, I received a letter handwritten by him. The content is mostly his apology to mother and I. It also mentioned the chip. It certainly is his handwriting but I know very well that the letter wasn't written by him. If I'm to make a guess, it's a counterfeit made by those bastards at A.R.C.

**Sasha**<br>
Why are you so sure?

**ConneR**<br>
With the mental and physical state father was in back then, it's hard to imagine that he ever had the ability and mood to write those words. The letter did indeed mention the chip, but it has one major error——father is someone who values his job and honor as much as his own life. There's no way he merely mentions his research on the chip amid all those mushy words.

**ConneR**<br>
If he truly wanted me to inherit the chip, he would've definitely handed over more detailed data and reports regarding his research. Yet what actually happened was that I had to painstakingly retrieve these documents from his messy lab all by myself.

**Sasha**<br>
But... if A.R.C. had the intention to hide all this, why did they let the chip still end up in your hands? They even went out of their way to write a fake letter.

**ConneR**<br>
There's one thing they don't know. Based on these fragmented data pieces, we can tell that father once connected this thing with his own virtual internet chip. Take a look; this is the scan data.

**Sasha**<br>
... There's even a date on it.

**ConneR**<br>
That's right, and that's exactly the point in time where his symptoms began to get significantly more severe.

**ConneR**<br>
The way I look at it, there's something hidden in this chip; something A.R.C. really wants yet is unable to get. They've been waiting all this time for father's research to produce results. However, he died before he ever did. And now, they plan to use me to solve this puzzle before retrieving it themselves.

**Sasha**<br>
Hoho? So it seems that you were let go on purpose... You're being underestimated.

**ConneR**<br>
I won't act that it doesn't bother me greatly. However, right now, our number one priority is still to restore these documents completely. We need to find the mistakes in father's research and in turn, obtain the content of the chip.

**Sasha**<br>
About that... I don't think my profession will be of much help.

**ConneR**<br>
It will. Back then, father treated this research as his own secret treasure and guarded it tightly. He insisted on completing all on his own. I think this was one of his flaws when conducting such a risky experiment. As with me... I have you by my side. Setting aside how much help you'll actually be, it at least makes me feel much more at ease

**Sasha**<br>
... Is that so? Then don't hate me for accidentally getting you killed.

**ConneR**<br>
*\*Chuckles\** Didn't I say before?<br>
Dying at your hands... That's not too bad of an ending for me either.

**Sasha**<br>
... Okay, okay\~ Let's get going.<br>
I'll handle the investigation of the message on the wall and the restoration of these documents. What about you?

**ConneR**<br>
I've got to first make a trip back to my previous home——the mansion of my ancestor Rald. Although the equipment has mostly been confiscated by A.R.C., I should be able to recreate a lab similar to the size of my father's.

**Sasha**<br>
How nostalgic, we're partners in crime again.

**ConneR**<br>
*\*Chuckles\** Partners.
