Entry\_1<br>
After a descent of around 50 minutes, I reached the bottom of the Ruins. Just like the drone scan, there is indeed a very large space down here. I'm walking along a straight passageway that should be heading towards the center of the structure. 

Entry\_2<br>
Movement at the pillar in the corner ahead of me. The thing seems to run towards the side passageway after discovering me. I'm pursuing it! [Detection: Sonar device activated]

Entry\_3<br>
Damnit! I lost it. I'm certain it ran this way... Wait a second, the sonar detected something... UGH! My eye! Bastard.... How is it possible? Why is that thing here?... <br>
