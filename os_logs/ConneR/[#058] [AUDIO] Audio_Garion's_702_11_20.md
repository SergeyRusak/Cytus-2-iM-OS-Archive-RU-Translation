*[Call Starts]*

**[Xenon]**<br>
*Hello?*

**ConneR**<br>
Mr. Jackson? I thought I called Miss Pauline's number.

**[Xenon]**<br>
*So what? Any progress with the investigation?*

**ConneR**<br>
Ooh, such a hostile attitude. Should I remind you who kept you two alive for an entire week not too long ago?

**[Xenon]**<br>
*Okay okay\~ Thanks\~<br>
You told me not to actively connect back to investigate the Æsir incident. That's why I'm waiting here in 03 like an idiot. If we don't get going soon...*

**ConneR**<br>
No need to rush. I just arrived in Node 13 not too long ago. It's quite difficult to find a place with a powerful enough signal here. It's definitely a lot more difficult than walking into a bar and ordering pork knuckles with a light beer, that much I can say for sure.

*\[Drinks wine\]*

**[Xenon]**<br>
*... And this is your investigation? Stop messing around. Now's not the time for you to be causally sightseeing.*

**ConneR**<br>
I'm kidding. I still have to eat. Can't do anything with an empty stomach, right?

**[Xenon]**<br>
*... I'm hanging up.*

*\[Drinks wine\]*

**ConneR**<br>
Haha, quite hot\-blooded, aren't you?<br>
Like I just said, I'm preparing to do some historical investigations and finish some research that was left unfinished from my previous stay here. My goal is to verify my speculations. This requires time, luck, preparation, and a little adventure.

**[Xenon]**<br>
*Don't forget about your right arm and right eye. The Exploration Team won't just happen to pass by there to save you every time.*

**ConneR**<br>
Thank you for being concerned about little old me, but no worries. I've always been pretty lucky.

**[Xenon]**<br>
*I'm concerned about the information you can provide. If you don't get any results on your side, we can't continue on our side, right?*

**ConneR**<br>
*\*Chuckles\** Rest assured. After the time I spent together with you guys, I've understood the importance of teamwork. I won't be a lone wolf and do everything by myself this time. Perhaps I'll find myself a trusty partner.

**[Xenon]**<br>
*Whatever you do. All in all, you better hurry.*

**ConneR**<br>
I know. About the next mission for you two to do in 03...

**[Xenon]**<br>
*"The Eye of Horus", right? I did a quick investigation according to the hints you provided. Such a person does indeed exist. This person has the ability to access digital information in the internet space, including ancient files that no one knows about anymore.*

**ConneR**<br>
... Now that's quite surprising. You already knew about this?

**[Xenon]**<br>
*This is all the info I can get. In 03, this seems to be a very well\-known urban legend among members of the underground society.<br>
Even though we can't confirm the authenticity of this... does someone like this really exist? It doesn't sound scientific at all.*

**ConneR**<br>
Aren't the most interesting parts of science the ones we know nothing about? Known science is one of the most boring things in this world.

**[Xenon]**<br>
*………*

**ConneR**<br>
Allow me to remind you once again. Your current situation is not a suitable one for you to conduct more investigations. Add to that the unstable nature of 03 and any careless action is a foolish one, not to mention something as idiotic as coming in direct contact with the gangs.

**[Xenon]**<br>
*Then do you have any advice, wilderness survival expert?*

**ConneR**<br>
*\*Chuckles\** I do. Listen carefully.<br>
"Wait for my next contact."

**[Xenon]**<br>
*………*

**ConneR**<br>
My food order is coming. Apologies, Mr. Jackson, but I have to go now.

**[Xenon]**<br>
*Are you for real? You're not taking this seriously...*

**ConneR**<br>
Ah, one more thing.

**[Xenon]**<br>
*？*

**ConneR**<br>
Your account got frozen, right? I'll send you one later. Feel free to use the money in there however you desire. With the garbage equipment you two have right now, I can't imagine that you'll be much of any help.
