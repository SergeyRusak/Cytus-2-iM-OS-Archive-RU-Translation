Huff... Puff...

**Sasha**<br>
Hey! Stand up!

**A.R.C. Security Guard**<br>
This is Area 09! Intruders! Data got stolen! Request support!<br>
Where did they go? You, go look that way!

**ConneR**<br>
Haha... You take the data and get out of here. I'll stay here...

**Sasha**<br>
What are you talking about? Here! We gotta go!

**ConneR**<br>
No... They didn't see my face. All the folks here know that I'm Colin's son. As long as I said that this injury is caused by the thief, I should be able to more or less fool them... This wound... it's best if I get treatment here too, since it's the fastest. Or else, I might die from excessive bleeding... go, now.

**Sasha**<br>
Idiot! You got hit with their bullet. The moment they dug it out, your cover will be blown! Grab on to me! I won't let you die, and I won't let you get captured either!

**Sasha**<br>
Are you ready?

**ConneR**<br>
Sasha, I still feel like we should think this plan out more carefully.

**Sasha**<br>
This is a once\-in\-a\-lifetime opportunity. If we miss this chance, we may have to give up on this money forever.

**ConneR**<br>
But... a physical infiltration and theft... I'm not exactly confident.

**Sasha**<br>
Due to a sudden change in Area 09's firewall coding, we won't be able to obtain the remaining data unless we do a physical break\-in... Aren't you the one who said that?

**ConneR**<br>
This is my responsibility... Getting found out is my problem. Therefore, we should also wait for me to crack the new firewall as well. That way, we can continue to follow our original plan.

**Sasha**<br>
Listen up. The files' encryption itself is one thing. The Area 09 firewall is a totally different matter. To our knowledge, A.R.C. doesn't have a more advanced security system than this. In other words, they didn't change the coding; they just switched to a set of logic you can't crack.

**ConneR**<br>
......

**Sasha**<br>
If that's the case, we can't guarantee that other hackers won't use this chance to try to get their share, especially with this info being more and more widespread on the market. We're already running out of time...

**ConneR**<br>
I've always wanted to ask you this... you seemed very persistent about time. Is there some sort of desperate need on your side? If possible, I'd still prefer to do it slowly and steadily...

**Sasha**<br>
No, we have to destroy that data. We cannot let other people obtain it.

**ConneR**<br>
... You don't sound as calm and collected as you usually are.

**Sasha**<br>
... Sorry... perhaps you're right. You can say that I'm doing this for my own reasons. Just trust me this one time.

**ConneR**<br>
Sure.

**Sasha**<br>
I know it's hard to believe, but... Eh? What did you say?

**ConneR**<br>
I said sure. I trust you.

**Sasha**<br>
... That straightforward personality of yours... I really don't know whether I should be happy or worried about it.

**ConneR**<br>
No, I didn't forget your teaching that I should always be cautious towards people. However, right now, I'm trusting you simply because I want to.

**Sasha**<br>
......

**ConneR**<br>
After all, Sasha never asked anything about my private life either. Naturally, as your apprentice, I don't have the right to point any fingers at your motives either. Our collaboration for these past few months has been going very smoothly according to your plan. I feel like there's this special understanding between us. If anything, I was merely worried about you getting injured.

**Sasha**<br>
... Don't be full of yourself, rookie. Compare to me, you should worry about your own a\*\* first.

**Sasha**<br>
You're awake?

**ConneR**<br>
... I thought I saw an angel. Turns out I'm still alive.

**Sasha**<br>
Enough with the snappy remarks. Drink this. It'll help your wounds heal faster.

**ConneR**<br>
... What about the data?

**Sasha**<br>
Right here. I expected no less from me. Got both the man and the goods despite a busted transaction.

**ConneR**<br>
Even though you got me shot a few times... right? Haha... ow...

**Sasha**<br>
I also said that maybe one day these holes will be on you, right? Stop complaining. Take that as a price for this lesson.

**ConneR**<br>
Yes yes\~ I get it, my dear teacher.

**Sasha**<br>
... Although you held me back, for your first ever theft operation, you worked your butt off. It was a commendable effort by you.

**ConneR**<br>
... I... am doing these things for an ideal I believe is correct. Therefore, I figure that you're probably the same too...right? <br>
When that thought popped into my mind, my body just inadvertently sprung into action...

**Sasha**<br>
......

**ConneR**<br>
Although I said something that sounded really cool, in reality, I ended up looking like a total mess. It seems... that I still have... much to...<br>
......Zzz......

**Sasha**<br>
You lost too much blood. Take a rest.

**Sasha**<br>
......

**Sasha**<br>
... Thank you. You were really cool back there.
