**Sasha**<br>
Not everyone can score a reservation at this restaurant, so enjoy yourself.

**ConneR**<br>
*\*Chuckles\** What's with all this? I didn't expect you to ask me out in private for something that's not related to the operation. Safe to say I'm quite surprised.

**Sasha**<br>
I'm also quite surprised myself... the fact that you're willing to let me treat you. As a young master of a noble family, I thought you'de be against the idea of a female treating you.

**ConneR**<br>
Masculism is not part of the Neumann family's teachings. Moreover, not accepting the invitation and treat of a lady is what truly counts as an insult and an act of disdain towards the lady. I feel like that's a message worth living by, don't you think?

**Sasha**<br>
Haha, couldn't have said it any better myself.<br>
Here, order anything you want. I trust your taste in food.

**ConneR**<br>
Then I shall proceed with my orders. Waiter, please...

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

**Sasha**<br>
This is delicious! I've been here so many times, yet I never thought of this combination. I expect no less from you.

**ConneR**<br>
I'm flattered. Then, as the ending to this meal, this 90\-year aged fine red wine, I believe you'd be very satisfied with it as well.

*\[Glass clinks\]*

**Sasha**<br>
......! Amazing... It tastes completely different after having the main course just now. On top of that, the impression left on the taste buds by the aperitif... I had this wine before, but it's nothing like this.

**ConneR**<br>
I'm glad to see you like it. Then, it's about time you tell me the true purpose of this meal, isn't it?

**Sasha**<br>
Tomorrow is the last transaction. It also marks the end of our partnership. I just want to celebrate this occasion a little bit.

**ConneR**<br>
Haha, doesn't feel like something you would do. Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed it.

**Sasha**<br>
I'm not a heartless person. You just don't understand the other, non\-work side of me well enough.

**ConneR**<br>
Indeed. However, after this meal, I learned quite a few things.

**Sasha**<br>
Ho? For example?

**ConneR**<br>
Although Sasha constantly mentioned that you grew up in a "s\*\*\*hole" environment, your table manners are uncharacteristically on point, not something that can be achieved with just a night of practice.  Many details and small habits feel very natural, like you've learned them since childhood. In some instances, your manners are even more on\-point than mine.

**Sasha**<br>
*\*Chuckles\**... You're truly... truly an interesting guy. Maybe you're right? Maybe you're not? Maybe everything I told you was a total lie. If I don't do that, how am I going to fool other people?

**ConneR**<br>
Haha, you have a point. However, I've spent my whole life figuring out other people's lies and truths, and I'm already tired of it. At the very least, I really like who you are right now. That's a truth for me.

**Sasha**<br>
Fufufu... you drank too much.

*[→Signal Switches]*

**ConneR**<br>
Ugh... cough cough...

**Sasha**<br>
Oioi... You really drank too much. Here, hold on to me.

**ConneR**<br>
Apologies... What a shameful display... Where is this?

**Sasha**<br>
A hotel room upstairs. With you as wasted as you are, I can't just leave you on the side of the road, can I?

**ConneR**<br>
Thank you...

**Sasha**<br>
Here, lie down. We still need to do a transaction tomorrow...

**ConneR**<br>
...... (Kiss)

**Sasha**<br>
......!

**ConneR**<br>
......<br>
Ah...! I'm so sorry! What the hell is wrong with me... Please forget it. I'm drunk...

**Sasha**<br>
......

**ConneR**<br>
......!

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

**ConneR**<br>
... Can't fall asleep?

**Sasha**<br>
Yes. Did I wake you from your sleep? Sorry.

**ConneR**<br>
Not at all. Put on some clothes. You'll catch a cold.

**Sasha**<br>
......

**ConneR**<br>
... "What are these people so busy about?"... When I was little, that's the thought that always popped into my mind when I looked at those twinkling dots of light in this night view. This city which I once thought to be so fake, only to turn around and discover its beauty to be so real. How ironic...

**Sasha**<br>
Is that so...? As with me, I've completely lost sight of the real side already. I don't know when it began. However, to me, it has been covered by something for a very long time.

**ConneR**<br>
... My father once said, "Humans are a creature that fears the truth. Because of our total ignorance, we choose to cover our cowardness with a layer of lies and refuse to move forward."

**Sasha**<br>
I thought you left home because you have a terrible relationship with your father, but you really do like to quote him.

**ConneR**<br>
My respect for him has never changed. Even though he is also engulfed by fear right now, the part of him that's worthy of respect still very much remains in my heart.

**Sasha**<br>
... You truly are loyal to the human heart.

**ConneR**<br>
Yes... Loyal to the point where you can consider it sickening. Once I have a person I admire, I can't stand even one tiny bit of smudge on him. I won't allow him to selfishly ruin his place in my heart...

**ConneR**<br>
I will definitely... use my own strength to solve the mystery that not even father could solve. I will prove to everyone that he's not a mad man... and prove myself to him.

**Sasha**<br>
......

**ConneR**<br>
We may not see each other ever again after tomorrow. No matter what happens, I want to tell you, that I am extremely blessed to have you come into my life.

**Sasha**<br>
......<br>
... Colin, I...

**ConneR**<br>
What's the matter?

**Sasha**<br>
... Nothing. After all, this is a s\*\*\*hole world where justice doesn't exist anywhere... We can only do what we each believe is the right thing to do.
