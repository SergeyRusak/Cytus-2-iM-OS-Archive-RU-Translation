**Colin**<br>
BASTARD! This guy too, that guy too... none of these bastards believe me!

*\[Things breaking\]*

**Colin**<br>
For the past few decades, all the things I have done for you people, all the items I had excavated... and this is how you repay me!? A suspension!? "Honorable employee"... What the goddamn f\*\*\* is this garbage bulls\*\*\*!

**ConneR**<br>
......

*\[Door Closes\]*

**Colin**<br>
You sons of b\*\*\*\*\*\*! If you don't believe me, then open my brain! Dissect it all you want! You'll get to see the sight of those damn Architects attacking us...

**ConneR**<br>
Sighs...

*\[Door Knock\]*

**ConneR**<br>
... Father?

**Alyxia**<br>
Colin, it's me.

*\[Door Opens\]*

**ConneR**<br>
What's the matter, mothe... Yikes! Your face...

**Alyxia**<br>
It's okay... I'm fine.

**ConneR**<br>
The first\-aid kit is downstairs. I'll go get it...

**Alyxia**<br>
No, he has fallen asleep. Don't disturb him... I have something to tell you.

**ConneR**<br>
Tell me...?

**Alyxia**<br>
Colin... let's leave this home.

*\[Things crashing\]*

**ConneR**<br>
L, leave?

**Alyxia**<br>
I know you are very surprised. But we've been working so hard, yet he just couldn't come out of it. He just kept thinking that A.R.C. doesn't believe him... then venting all his anger on us...

**ConneR**<br>
......

**Alyxia**<br>
You should understand, right? The dignified and prideful Colin has already disappeared in the forbidden areas. He will never come back again. Right now, he is nothing more than a violent drunkard...

**ConneR**<br>
Mother... I...

**Alyxia**<br>
I know... I also hope he can recover and return to his previous self again. In my mind, he is still my husband... but for the past year, I feel like... I just can't take it anymore... *\*Sobs\**...

**ConneR**<br>
......

**Alyxia**<br>
I've already contacted my household. We'll be leaving soon... Colin, come with me. If you keep staying here, your life will be ruined by him as well. You're just sixteen. You can't...

**ConneR**<br>
... Sorry, mother. I... I can't go with you.

**Alyxia**<br>
W, why?

**ConneR**<br>
Mother... I know how tough things have been for you this past year. That's why I understand your decision to leave... but if I leave him as well, father will truly lose everything. He'll never, ever return to normal again... It's like I abandoned my own father and left him to die all alone.

**ConneR**<br>
As his son... I just can't let that happen. I can't do that.

**Alyxia**<br>
Colin...

**ConneR**<br>
I'm sorry, mother... I will figure out a way to keep father here. If the situation calls for it, I'll ask Grace to help too. You should leave for a safe place as soon as possible.

**Alyxia**<br>
Then what about you?

**ConneR**<br>
I'll continue to work hard... No, work even harder than I did before. I'll let father know, that I achieved his expectations for me. Then, he'll wake up from his nightmare too. We can finally get together as a family again.

**Alyxia**<br>
*... \*Sobs\*...*

**ConneR**<br>
Mother?

**Alyxia**<br>
... In mother's mind, you're always that little boy who fell off a horse and sat there with a beaming smile... But when I didn't notice, you've grown up already. You're now a man capable of making this kind of decision yourself.

**ConneR**<br>
......

*\[Things breaking\]*

**ConneR**<br>
Huh! He's awake... Mother, go! Now!

**Alyxia**<br>
Okay... Colin, no matter what, mother will always be proud of you. I'm really sorry, but I'll leave your father to you, okay?

**ConneR**<br>
Yes. I'll take care of father. Here, leave from the side gate.

**Alyxia**<br>
I love you, my son...

**ConneR**<br>
I love you too... mom.

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Colin**<br>
Booze? Where is my Booze?<br>
Gimme the Booze...

**Colin**<br>
Alyxia! Grace! Get the f\*\*\* over here!

**ConneR**<br>
Father's... hope...
