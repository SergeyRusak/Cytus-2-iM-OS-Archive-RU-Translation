Dear guest,

Thank you for accepting the position as head of the project. The institute will be holding an open conference at the A.R.C. HQ's main lobby in three days. We will be announcing at the conference: the outline of the project, the main members and how the resources will be distributed. 

To ensure academic exchange and the objective of delivering a positive image, we have invited the media, industry people and executives of the administration bureau to participate in this conference. We would like you to attend as well.

Best regards.<br>
A.R.C. Supreme Committee
