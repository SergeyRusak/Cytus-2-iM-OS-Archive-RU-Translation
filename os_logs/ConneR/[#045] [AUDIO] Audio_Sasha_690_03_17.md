**Sasha**<br>
As expected, the news is all over the market now. Area 09 is no longer just an urban legend on the dark web.

**ConneR**<br>
Looks like there are more and more people scrambling to get in on the action...

**Sasha**<br>
Not just that. Check this out, the decryption maniacs among hackers are also looking to buy this data. They all want a shot at cracking this encryption.

**ConneR**<br>
What a frenzy...

**Sasha**<br>
If we want to know the content inside these storage units, we'd have to rely on these experts... but we can't let whoever we ask obtain the decrypted data either...

**ConneR**<br>
If the data is spread on the market, it loses its value... correct?

**Sasha**<br>
Exactly... Of these hackers, there's this one guy that kind of caught my interest. It's a guy that goes by the name "X"...

**ConneR**<br>
X?

**Sasha**<br>
It's a guy that has made a bit of name for himself on the dark web these days. He's nicknamed "Hacker of Private Law". He uses his hacking skills to resolve all sorts of injustices, yet he never seeks to earn any profit from his actions. Many people in my organization got screwed over by him before too.

**ConneR**<br>
... So people like that still exist? Interesting.

**Sasha**<br>
Yeah. However, from my perspective, he is nothing more than a naive kid who is presumingly roleplaying as a hero of justice. If justice truly does exist somewhere in this world, it would definitely not be in a s\*\*\*hole like this.

**ConneR**<br>
......

**Sasha**<br>
Despite all that, there is no doubt about his skills as a hacker. As of now, no one is able to track him down or find out his real identity. He also has yet to fail an operation. Since it appears that he has little to no personal desires, maybe we can put him to our use. 

**ConneR**<br>
In other words, since he won't try to make a profit with the decrypted data, we get to maintain the market value of the data while getting its content decrypted. 

**Sasha**<br>
Yes... The only problem is that this guy only helps those who are "the good guys".

**ConneR**<br>
No matter how you look at it, I don't think we can be considered "the good guys"...

**Sasha**<br>
I said before; when dealing with arrogant brats like this who measured the righteousness of things with that utterly crooked ruler in their hearts, we just need to make him "think" that we are on his side. 

**ConneR**<br>
......!

**Sasha**<br>
The fact that A.R.C. has a server block like this and its existence is unbeknownst to the admins; that alone is already illegal. Something's definitely fishy. <br>
If we approach him from that angle, I believe he'll at least be somewhat interested in our case.

**ConneR**<br>
I see.

**Sasha**<br>
In short, I'll handle this. However, this still isn't quite enough. It's about time you tell me the method you used to obtain this data too, isn't it?

**ConneR**<br>
......

**Sasha**<br>
If your method can be duplicated, we cannot guarantee that our plan will succeed. At the very least, we have to ensure that other people won't be able to get their hands on our prize.

**ConneR**<br>
That is extremely unlikely. The name I told you yesterday... Colin, that's actually not a codename. My name is Colin Neumann Jr. I am the son of Colin Neumann.

**Sasha**<br>
......! A.R.C.'s......<br>
Sigh... I knew it. You look nothing like someone who actually grew up in these s\*\*\*holes. 

**ConneR**<br>
Even though father has been suspended by the company and is currently resting at home, his contributions to A.R.C. allowed him to keep his role as an honorable employee. As long as his information and privileges are still there in the database, I can use some small tricks and download the data of Area 09 without leaving any trace at all. That's pretty much the gist of it. 

**Sasha**<br>
But there's a data flow limit for each download. If you overdo it, you'll get busted, right?

**ConneR**<br>
Indeed, you're right on point. The time intervals between each download can't be too short either. On average, the amount of data I can download a month is the amount we have on our hands right now.

**Sasha**<br>
... I think that should be enough. Maybe we can download the entire piece within half\-a\-year...  Then I'll handle the decryption. You'll continue to do what you should do until you empty out Area 09.

**ConneR**<br>
Empty out!?

**Sasha**<br>
Yes. You'll do it on the last time you download the data. We still don't know what A.R.C. stored in there, nor do we know who did all this. Nevertheless, I can make a safe guess that whoever did this also plan to profit privately from it. If they hit the market earlier than us, we're gonna be completely screwed. 

**ConneR**<br>
Understood.

**Sasha**<br>
One more thing, an extra lesson 3: Don't ever use that real name for any activity again. How retarded do you have to be to use your real name for stuff like this? You're now part of this world too, so you must always be in a cautious state, understood?

**ConneR**<br>
... I'm very sorry.

**Sasha**<br>
Whatever... Starting today, you'll be "R". You can call me "Shark". That's my codename on the dark web. Sasha is not my real name either, obviously.

**ConneR**<br>
R...

**Sasha**<br>
What? You don't like it?

**ConneR**<br>
No, it's just that the sight of you lecturing me reminds me of my father during my childhood years.

**Sasha**<br>
Yikes... Do I really speak that much like an old man?

**ConneR**<br>
No... that's not what I meant. Don't mind me. Shark... I think I'll just keep calling you Sasha.

**Sasha**<br>
Whatever you prefer.
