**Sasha**<br>
Ughhh... huh?

**ConneR**<br>
Are you awake?

**Sasha**<br>
Is this... where is this? What happened...?

**ConneR**<br>
Don't move. You're injured.

**Sasha**<br>
......

**ConneR**<br>
Is your mind clearer now? Do you know what happened?

**Sasha**<br>
... I was arrested. Captain Wood... died. On the way back... right, the car malfunctioned. It was you...

**ConneR**<br>
Not just me. I borrowed a bit of help from X in order to get you out. Though I had to pull some tricks before he was willing to help... he really is quite the interesting character.

**Sasha**<br>
I didn't think you could escape... Did you already know? That I was a spy...

**ConneR**<br>
Yeah. I thought you'd notice it too. However, whether you noticed or not doesn't really matter to me anyway.

**Sasha**<br>
Ha... being played by my own disciple... When did you start suspecting me?

**ConneR**<br>
Suspecting? Ah, I see. That's what you think. As a deceiver, you failed spectacularly.

**Sasha**<br>
... Thanks to that hypnotizing bomb you threw at me back there, I'm really dizzy right now. I'm too lazy to think anymore. Explain it to me.

**ConneR**<br>
I'll give you a clue. That busted transcation that resulted in you escaping to Saxon's place, have you ever wondered why it got busted to begin with?

**Sasha**<br>
......!

**ConneR**<br>
That's right. From our little encounter there, to all the time we spent together these past couple months, it was all part of my plan.

**Sasha**<br>
......

**ConneR**<br>
I knew very early on what kind of data was stored in Area 09, because it wasn't encrypted at all in the first place. I imitated A.R.C.'s encryption methods and added the encryption myself.

**ConneR**<br>
I knew that you were sending the decrypted data back to the Administration Bureau. X was only willing to work with you because Captain Wood directly talked to him, right?

**ConneR**<br>
And all the money given to me after each transaction, they were going to be taken back by the Bureau when I was captured anyway. Not a bad idea.

**ConneR**<br>
But unfortunately for you, the data you folks archived was one that was swapped out by me. The real data has been with me all this time, in the storage unit right behind me.

*\[Data Projection\]*

**ConneR**<br>
This is your deleted Law Enforcement Agent profile, right? Zoe Watson.

**Sasha**<br>
So you knew my identity all along... Do you know me?

**ConneR**<br>
*\*Chuckles\**  Know isn't exactly the right word. We're merely students of the same graduation class. You left to study at the Law Enforcement Academy. When I read through these profiles, I noticed your name right away, which is how I learned of your identity.

**Sasha**<br>
... You used me and the Administration Bureau to get huge amounts of resources and money. All the data is in your hands. The people from the organization and Bureau were all played by you like a fiddle. Both seriously injured as a result...

**Sasha**<br>
So even your feelings for me are fake... A, haha, so that's how it is?

**Sasha**<br>
I've got to applaud you. I nearly thought you were serious...

**ConneR**<br>
......

**Sasha**<br>
Well, then what is all this about? Your plan should've ended once I got captured, right?

**ConneR**<br>
Originally, yes. But the plan has been slightly altered.

**Sasha**<br>
... So where are you going to take me now?

**ConneR**<br>
Is this really the life you want? Andrew Wood is dead. The data that can prove your identity is in my hands. There's nowhere in Node 08 for you to go.

**Sasha**<br>
......

**ConneR**<br>
Go to another Node and start a new life. The nearest I can take you to is Node 10. Even though that place has not been functioning since "The Decomission", it's still works as a temporary shelter. For you, surviving there shouldn't be an issue.

**ConneR**<br>
Your family is in Node 13, just like me. Although you no longer have family there, going back may not a bad idea either. I really like it there.

**Sasha**<br>
... Is caring about my life part of your plan as well? I don't see this bringing you any benefits.

**ConneR**<br>
Indeed. It's a thankless and boring task, and I don't get anything out of it.

**Sasha**<br>
Then why...

**ConneR**<br>
Didn't I already tell you? I really like who you are right now. That's a truth for me.

**Sasha**<br>
......

**ConneR**<br>
"No... not just now... It was long before all this... How do I put it? In my mind, I believe I owed you a massive favor, and I've always wanted to repay that favor.

**Sasha**<br>
......?

**ConneR**<br>
When I first saw your profile, I had already completely forgotten that feeling. I was only thinking about how I was going to use you to achieve my goals.

**ConneR**<br>
But I guess I'm not as rational as I consider myself to be. After spending some time together with you, that truth has become more obvious it than ever was. 

**Sasha**<br>
......

**ConneR**<br>
It was when we were both students...
