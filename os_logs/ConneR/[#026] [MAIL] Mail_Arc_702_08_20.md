Dear Sensei,

Right now we can barely contain our excitement. Please allow me and the team to pay you the highest respect we can give. The concert worked much better than any of us ever imagined. It also completely changed our views on the impact and emotions a physical concert can give. <br>
Sensei's performance not only touched the audience; the owner of the Central Music Hall came to us and told us that if Sensei ever wants to perform again, Central Music Hall will give Sensei the no.1 priority to pick any venue you desire. <br>
We look forward to working with you again.

Sincerely,

The entire SkyEkho team
