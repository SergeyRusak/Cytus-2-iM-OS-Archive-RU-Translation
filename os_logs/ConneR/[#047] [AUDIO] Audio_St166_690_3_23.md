*[Call Starts]*

**[Sasha]**<br>
*R? Check your account.*

**ConneR**<br>
......!? So much money...

**[Sasha]**<br>
*I let X think that I'm someone from the Administration Bureau. He's willing to cooperate with me.*

**ConneR**<br>
......

**[Sasha]**<br>
*In short, I'll skip straight to the conclusion. After the first batch of data was decrypted, I immediately found a buyer. Spent some time talking to squeeze more cash out of him. What you see is your share, 50/50 between us. *

**ConneR**<br>
It's much, much more than I ever imagined. Thank you. You have my sincere gratitude.

**[Sasha]**<br>
*Aren't you curious about the content of the data?*

**ConneR**<br>
Oh, right. What's inside?

**[Sasha]**<br>
*Detailed personal information of Node 08 citizens.*

**ConneR**<br>
Only personal information?

**[Sasha]**<br>
*No, not just civilians with regular identities. So far, we've seen personal information of the Administration Bureau's law enforcement agents, both in\-service and retired ones. There's also info on people in the organization. On top of that, it even has info that has already been deleted from the civilian database. *

**ConneR**<br>
... I remember now. A.R.C. once helped the Administration Bureau recreated the identity recognition system. It recorded the ID of every civilian. A few years ago, when they updated the hardware equipment... I see. Back then, someone kept these data stored somewhere to one day profit from it. 

**[Sasha]**<br>
*Afraid so. I don't think this is the act of an entire company. Even so, judging by the scale of this plan, it's safe to assume that there was at least a group of people doing this behind the company's back. If that's the case, others who are trying to steal this data will certainly run into a lot of obstacles. Fortunately, we have you. *

**ConneR**<br>
I'm humbled. Sidenote, is the buyer this time someone from the organization?

**[Sasha]**<br>
*Yes, a family call Ando. I believe you've heard that name before. They want to use this data to find the snitches that have been placed within their organization by the admins. In other words, spies.*

**ConneR**<br>
......

**[Sasha]**<br>
*All in all, we'll let them dig through the list. If the organization gets stronger, it's beneficial to information brokers like us too.<br>
How are things going on your side?*

**ConneR**<br>
Ah, I can perform the second download in a few days. I altered the logic of the program. I should be able to download even more data than I did last time.

**[Sasha]**<br>
*Good. Keep at it. If we can do this a couple more times, we'll both be a lot richer after the dust settles.*

**ConneR**<br>
Shark... Sasha, I'm thinking... In our next transaction, can we lock onto an organization call "Splice"? I think they are a sub\-org of the Baro gang.

**[Sasha]**<br>
*...? Is there something special to them?*

**ConneR**<br>
Some personal reasons. Besides getting their money, I also want to reduce their influences so things can be a bit easier for my future activities. If you can negotiate a good price with them, shoot me a message before the transaction. I have an idea.

**[Sasha]**<br>
*If I recall correctly, they're just a bunch of gravediggers, right? They don't have the technical capabilities of A.R.C., so they mostly just do boring antique trading. What's the point of picking a fight with an org like that?*

**ConneR**<br>
It's precisely because they only do boring antique trades... Excavation should be a much more meaningful activity, whether it's surface or underground. I just had enough of them occupying all the good spots and goofing around like monkeys.

**[Sasha]**<br>
*... You sound more and more like a pro in this business.*

**ConneR**<br>
Well, I have an excellent teacher after all.

**[Sasha]**<br>
*\*Chuckles\* Oh, spare me that stuff, you smartmouth. In short, I'll slightly alter the way we approach them to put you at a more advantageous position. Your plan sounds quite interesting, so count me in too, will ya?*

**ConneR**<br>
Of course, partner. Thanks.
