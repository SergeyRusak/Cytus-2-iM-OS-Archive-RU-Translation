**Mark**<br>
Hello Dr. Neumann. My colleague told me that you're looking for me?

**ConneR**<br>
Ah yes, Mr. Mark. You see, I know you helped me with the system access level two weeks ago, but there are still some things I would like to confirm.

**Mark**<br>
May I ask what would you like to confirm?

**ConneR**<br>
The data I can access is up to security Level 4, am I right?

**Mark**<br>
I'll take a look, please wait.

**ConneR**<br>
......

**Mark**<br>
Yes, it's indeed Level 4.

**ConneR**<br>
But last night I took some time to look through them. Turns out that I don't have 100% access to the Library's central database and the virtual connection's firewall files.

**Mark**<br>
Hmm... It's because of Dr. Neumann's unique identity and position. Therefore, despite the higher\-ups granting you Level 4 access, each department has their own independent review system to determine whether or not to grant you access. That process may take a while.

**ConneR**<br>
Is that so.... It seems like the title of "advisor" is not as convenient as I thought it would be?

**Mark**<br>
... Yes.

**ConneR**<br>
On a side note, do you know who has access to the physical central database in A.R.C.?

**Mark**<br>
Ah... that... I'm sorry, that is beyond my security level. If Dr. Neumann has any more questions, you can contact the committee directly

**ConneR**<br>
Understood. Thank you.
