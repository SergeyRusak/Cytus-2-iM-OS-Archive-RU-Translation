Record:<br>
Entry\_1<br>
Target Artifact has appearance of some kind of circuit chip. Consists of two major components: the chip itself and the specialized port. The chip itself is produced with unparalleled precision. Even if we gather A.R.C.'s most elite teams, it's still nearly impossible to reach this level of precision. Estimated production date is 250 years ago, around 50 years before "The Decommission".

Entry\_2<br>
Performed a simple power transfer simulation to target chip. Was able to understand the majority of its inner workings through that. Besides its precision in production, has no notable difference to regular memory cells. The only exception is the specialized port part. Can't access the port directly. Preparing environment simulation test to search for possible ways to access said port. 

Entry\_3<br>
After 154,684 simulations, can conclude that target chip has functions that can only be activated when it is planted into the human brain via invasive methods. If unable to identify target to be human DNA, will trigger no reactions. Even when simulating human brain data with environment simulation, target chip saw through the simulation almost instantly and denied access. Risk is still under evaluation. Using actual human brain for direct experiments is strictly forbidden. 

Entry\_4<br>
During environment simulation test, had an extremely rare instance of bypassing the chip's defense mechanisms. During said bypass, instruments captured fragments of data. It's a message consisting of sound and imagery, like part of someone's memory. Besides that, mostly contains a data type that can't be analyzed by modern instruments. 

Judgement:<br>
Target chip's origin and usage highly suspectable. Suggest not reporting actual analysis results to Dr. Neumann. Discuss with Sagar to see if any special precautions are required.
