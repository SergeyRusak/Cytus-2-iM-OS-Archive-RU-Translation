**Medical Staff**<br>
Yikes!

**Sagar**<br>
He's awake!

**ConneR**<br>
Where am I? Let go of me!

**Medical Drone**<br>
Detection: Patient emotion unstable.<br>
Treatment: Sedative injection. Dosage: 15%

**ConneR**<br>
......!

**Sagar**<br>
Please calm down, Dr. Neumann. This is A.R.C.'s medical department in Node 08.<br>
28 hours ago, we found you unconscious and badly injured in Node 13's forbidden area. After giving you emergency medical treatment, a transport aircraft flew you here for a complete operation.

**ConneR**<br>
My right arm... what... have you people... done to me!?

**Sagar**<br>
When we found you, you had an inoperable comminuted fracture of your entire right arm, a badly damaged right eye and extreme blood loss. The doctors decided it was impossible to reconsruct your arm, so we installed a biomechanical prosthetic and an electronic eye. Right now, we are still in the process of reconstructing the nervous system. Please lie down and try to relax your muscles.

**ConneR**<br>
... Get this... disgusting piece of junk... off me...

**Medical Staff**<br>
Mister! Please don't do this! You guys, hold him down!

**Medical Drone**<br>
Detection: Patient attempts to interrupt reconstruction of nervous connection.<br>
Treatment: Sedative injection. Dosage: 35%

**Sagar**<br>
Alright, let him take a little nap.<br>
He may still have severe emotional reactions. Turn up the sensibility on the medical drones. I'll have two groups guarding the door in turns.
