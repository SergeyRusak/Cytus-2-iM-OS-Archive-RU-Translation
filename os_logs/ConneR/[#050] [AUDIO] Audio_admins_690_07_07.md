Captain Andrew.

**Andrew**<br>
You're here. Report.

**???**<br>
Yes. Reporting on the operation regarding the Area 09 incident.

**???**<br>
Current designated target Colin Neumann Jr.; last week, he had already successfully stolen all the data stored inside Area 09.

**Andrew**<br>
Very good. Then everything will return to the previous plan, right?

**???**<br>
Yes, sir. As of now, the final transaction target has been determined. It's "Splice".

**Andrew**<br>
The grave robbing group under the "Baro" gang? Although I don't have much interest in them...

**???**<br>
I understand that they aren't one of our primary targets right now. However, after my own investigation, I can say that they certainly do create a notable profit for Baro.

**Andrew**<br>
Hmmm...

**???**<br>
If we can utilize this operation to eliminate them, I believe it would cause pretty significant damage to Baro as well.

**Andrew**<br>
That does indeed sound like a good move. However, there are also quite a few of our comrades from the "Infiltration Plan" still inside Baro.

**???**<br>
... Captain, with all due respect, after that operation last year, we barely have any comrades in there now. As of now, we should focus more on the plan at hand.

**Andrew**<br>
......

**???**<br>
Colin's target also happens to be Splice. This is a plan that not only allows us to obtain the data but also deals a massive blow to the organization.

**Andrew**<br>
Kill two birds with one stone. You've always been excellent at that.

**???**<br>
Captain, you said so yourself. As long as we get our hands on the Area 09 data, the name list for the Infiltration Plan won't be leaked and everyone's safety can be guaranteed too.

**Andrew**<br>
Certainly. You plan is very ideal. Right now, our most important goals remain the same: cut off any possible routes the gangs may use to obtain this data, recover and archive this data, and finally, arrest the deceiver.

**???**<br>
......

**Andrew**<br>
What's the matter?

**???**<br>
... No, nothing. Then the plan is settled. For the detailed time and location of the transaction, I'll contact you again...

**Andrew**<br>
You've been serving under me for years. You know you can't hide things from me. Go ahead.

**???**<br>
... I was thinking... about Colin. He has way too much talent for this sort of thing. An arrest is perhaps not the best way for him to go...

**Andrew**<br>
You want to make him a member of the Infiltration Plan...?

**???**<br>
Not to that extent... But if we could further utilize him...

**Andrew**<br>
Negative. I know his background. In terms of his motives, he is way too difficult to control. We cannot add any more unstable pieces to the plan.

**???**<br>
......

**Andrew**<br>
This plan was originally going to be scrapped anyway. In the years it has operated in secret, it helped us admins solve a lot of cases on the surface, no doubt. It's also why I was able to climb all the way to where I am now. However, as an exchange, I'm now the only person that can keep you guys alive.

**???**<br>
......

**Andrew**<br>
You've always said that the plan is your first priority. Nevertheless, in reality, you desire to leave this kind of life as soon as possible too, right?

**???**<br>
... I...

**Andrew**<br>
I can safely say the operation this time resolved most of my concerns. You've performed exceptionally. If you can accomplish the mission, I will immediately give you back your law enforcement agent identity. You'll be able to put on your uniform once again.

**???**<br>
Captain... I hear those words from you at least once every year...

**Andrew**<br>
No. This incident, along with the operation last year, has already made it painfully clear to me. This plan simply cannot keep going on... Maybe the Infiltration Plan will be continued. However, it'd have to be done in a more efficient manner.

**???**<br>
......

**Andrew**<br>
You don't want to see more comrades die as well, right? Be it the ones on the surface... or the ones under it.

**???**<br>
......! No, I...

**Andrew**<br>
Calm down. I'm not blaming you for developing emotions for people on "that" side. You've been in that environment for so many years. You can't fool those people without having some feelings towards them. Nonetheless, this kind of lifestyle is just way too brutal for you. Someone as talented as you deserve a better life.

**???**<br>
......

**Andrew**<br>
In short, this case will be entering its final stages. Once we get our hands on the data, the deceiver and the grave robbing group, I will give you back your uniform.

**???**<br>
Understood...

**Andrew**<br>
I'll leave it to you, Sasha.

**Sasha**<br>
Yes. Then I'll be taking my leave.
