**Sagar**<br>
Frequency 107.83, Captain Sagar. Please identify yourself.

**Rin**<br>
Hello, Sagar, it's me...

**Sagar**<br>
Rin?

**Rin**<br>
Yes. Are you alright?

**Sagar**<br>
I'm fine? It's quite rare that you decided to call me on the radio. We're about to enter the Ruins. The signal might get lost all of a sudden.

**Rin**<br>
Umm... I have something I want to ask you; it's about work...

**Sagar**<br>
Hm? Sure, go ahead. 

**Rin**<br>
Dr. Neumann from Library sent in the data of an "artifact" for me to analyze. I find it a bit odd. 

**Sagar**<br>
You met with him!? Did he do anything weird to you?

**Rin**<br>
Um, no. Actually, he's pretty nice to me. 

**Sagar**<br>
Good. Pay extra attention to that person. He's very sharp. I don't want him to know about that incident. 

**Rin**<br>
Yeah...

**Sagar**<br>
What's wrong with the artifact data he sent in?

**Rin**<br>
Yeah... according to analysis, this artifact should be classified as grade S, but there are no records of it in A.R.C.'s listings...

**Sagar**<br>
What kind of artifact is it?

**Rin**<br>
He didn't give me the actual item, but judging from the holo\-simulation and the data he gave me, it looks like some kind of chip. The circuit part is ancient technology; I can analyze that no problem. However, both ports on the top are models I've never seen before. I can't find the communication protocols in the database either...

**Sagar**<br>
I expect no less from Doc... I've been in this exploration thing with my dad for years; never discovered an artifact of this type...<br>
But I'm not surprised. He has such an experience trespassing into the forbidden areas and Ruins. Naturally, it makes sense that he secretly owns several grade S artifacts or has information on them. 

**Rin**<br>
... Is this legal?

**Sagar**<br>
Of course it's illegal! However, he's indeed a very special figure. As a matter of fact, his hiring at A.R.C. itself is something that is way outside the system...<br>
Regardless, complete the report first; but don't report it to the higher\-ups. Wait until I get back, then we'll deal with it together. OK?

**Rin**<br>
How about the report for doctor?

**Sagar**<br>
Umm, let me think... just give him a fake one with minimum analysis, for now at least. 

**Rin**<br>
Huh? C, Can we do that?

**Sagar**<br>
In theory, no; but like I just said, he is someone who operates outside the system. Can't go wrong by being more careful when dealing with him.<br>
Also, I'm pretty certain that he didn't go through the proper procedures when filing this analysis request. In that case, you don't have to follow the rules either.

**Rin**<br>
OK...

**Sagar**<br>
If anything comes up, contact me immediately. I won't let anything harm you. 

**Rin**<br>
Thank you... By the way, this artifact actually allowed me to remember some things...

**Sagar**<br>
Oh? About your past? That's great! What did you remember?

**Rin**<br>
Umm... N, not much actually, just some broken pieces of imagery. I can't really describe it... but I feel a sense of fear in them...

**Sagar**<br>
Hey, no worries. Don't think about it. <br>
I said before: I won't force you to remember your forgotten past. Instead, I want you to focus on living your current life, OK?

**Rin**<br>
... Yes. I'm sorry. There isn't much I can help with...

**Sagar**<br>
Don't be too hard on yourself. You've been plenty of help to me already. <br>
The job this time is near Node 15. There are tons of exotic plants and flowers in the lower levels of this area. Run some analysis yourself. If there are any particular ones that interest you, tell me. I'll bring them back for you. 

**Rin**<br>
Really? That's awesome!<br>
Let's see... There should be a fern plant that can change its color at the coordinates \-2247.5, 2166.3, \-330.1. Haven't come up with an actual name yet. Also, above that location, there is a small plain. A flower known as Iris exists there. Oh, there's more! The daisies you brought back last time, there should be some on the lower levels as well. The different environment may cause them to grow a bit differently...

**Sagar**<br>
My god, slow down there miss... No way in hell I can remember all this if you just dump them to me through the radio! Organize a list and send it to me. Once we get to a place where we can access the internet, I'll get it. Then I'll try and find everything you want. Understand?

**Rin**<br>
AH! S, sorry. I was too excited...

**Sagar**<br>
Haha... it's ok. 

**Sagar**<br>
... Oh, right. After I come back from this exploration...

**Rin**<br>
Hmm?

**Sagar**<br>
Umm... nothing! We are about to enter a place where the signals can't reach, so let's stop here!<br>
Remember to contact me if something happens with Doc's request; don't take any action before discussing it with me, ok? See ya!

**Rin**<br>
OK, I get it...

*[Signal Lost]*

**Rin**<br>
... I'll be waiting for you.
