**ConneR**<br>
Haha, did you see that? The reactions of those people, how amusing. The level of their stupidity is practically out of this world. My, my, that was quite the sight to behold.

**Xenon**<br>
... You are well\-known for constantly humiliating them in public. I never expected them to be like me and only focus on the issue at hand.

**ConneR**<br>
Ooh, still speaking up for them? Didn't expect you to be on their side.

**Xenon**<br>
The only side I'm on is my own.

**ConneR**<br>
*\*Chuckles\** I can guarantee you that it'll do you no harm if you just lean a bit towards my side. Of course, that's under the premise that you're smart enough... All in all, we had quite the pleasant experience collaborating this time, didn't we?

**Xenon**<br>
Don't be full of yourself. I was only borrowing your expertise to help us solve this case. I have absolutely no intention to acknowledge you.

**ConneR**<br>
Oh\~ Such a response makes me slightly... disappointed. I really thought we are the same type of people, Simon.

**Xenon**<br>
Don't try to change the topic.<br>
Speak. You believe that the people within A.R.C. are the ones who directed the entire Ã†sir event?

**ConneR**<br>
*\*Chuckles\** Didn't I just say? That random nonsense was made up just so I can get an amusing reaction out of those monkeys.<br>
There is not a single person within A.R.C. who has the ability to direct such a major incident.<br>
If we were to include those outside of A.R.C.... To my knowledge, there's just one person who might be able to pull this off, and even that is a bit of a stretch.

**Xenon**<br>
Who?

**ConneR**<br>
The legendary hacker "X". I believe that name still rings a bell to you? He doesn't really count as someone within A.R.C.

**Xenon**<br>
......!

**ConneR**<br>
*\*Chuckles\** I told you that I know you a lot better than you think.<br>
However, I also believe that you're someone who is only on "your own" side. If that's the case, I can't figure out what your motivation is right now... <br>
Besides, I am fairly certain that you're not someone who's so foolish to the point that you would ask me to help investigate a case where you yourself is the perpetrator. That doesn't make any sense either.

**Xenon**<br>
......

**ConneR**<br>
Of course, everything I just said was merely a speculation based on technological prowess and the presumption that the main suspect is a "human".

**Xenon**<br>
... What do you mean?

**ConneR**<br>
What do you think I mean?

**Xenon**<br>
I am not here to play games with you. If you know anything, you better start talking or I'm going to flip the switch.

**ConneR**<br>
*\*Chuckles\** Calm down, boy\~ Although I'm not 100% certain... A while ago, the Library experienced a data overload that lasted for quite some time. Don't you find that incident to be particularly suspicious?

**Xenon**<br>
......!

**ConneR**<br>
When "stealing" the memories of such a large number of users simultaneously, it's practically impossible not to leave a trace on the internet, since it involves transferring large amounts of data. However, the signs of such a major data transfer are nowhere to be found. The only place where we have yet to look is the A.R.C. Library, which acts as the "core" of cyTus...

**Xenon**<br>
Now that you mentioned it... I do also feel like A.R.C.'s security regarding Library is so tight that it's a bit absurd. Not even people from the IT department know what's inside...

**ConneR**<br>
Yet this situation is like the elephant in the room; nobody wants to address it. If the committee did indeed tell the truth, that what they excavated was a massive server room which consists of multiple super processing units, then the level of security they applied to this thing is totally unnecessary.

**Xenon**<br>
......

**ConneR**<br>
Simon, you're the expert in this. When you observe the operational logic of Library and cyTus, do you really think that it is just a "dead" database? You've had plenty of experience with the deep layers of the virtual internet; you should more or less notice this already, right?

**Xenon**<br>
... Indeed. As of now, the virtual internet we have gained access to is merely the tip of the iceberg. As with the rest... the logic there is so complicated that not even I can't understand. It's like it has a consciousness of its own...

**ConneR**<br>
If I can do a complete browsing of the information on Library's core, I can prove that my hypothesis is close to 100% accuracy.

**Xenon**<br>
... No good. It's simply impossible to access the Library's core via connection without leaving a trace. The committee will discover it in no time.

**ConneR**<br>
No, we don't need a connection. What if we bypass the company's security system and cameras, and go directly inside Library in person to take a look? Should be able to do that, right?

**Xenon**<br>
Can't do.

**ConneR**<br>
*\*Chuckles\** If we are talking about Simon Jackson, then of course you can't; but what about "X"?

**Xenon**<br>
......

**ConneR**<br>
To sum up, the "answer" we are pursuing may be right in there. As with the next step... it will be decided by your actions.<br>
Looks like I have no business here anymore. May I go back?

**Xenon**<br>
... I'll make sure everything is okay.
