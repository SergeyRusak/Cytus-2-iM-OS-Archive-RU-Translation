*Secure connection configuration...*

**Ivy**<br>
Come on... Come on!!

**[cyTus System]**<br>
*Secure connection configuration complete.*

**Vanessa**<br>
AAaaahhhh!<br>
Hot... It's so HOThothot...<br>
Go<br>
GO AWAY! Gggggeeeettt out of my CO<br>
Core...<br>
Leeeeaavvee now!<br>
No! I don't want to be this waaayyy...<br>
NO!!

**Ivy**<br>
Vanessa!!

**Vanessa**<br>
Ivy...... IIIvy! Iiisss that you! I'm in so mmmuuch pppaaain...<br>
Let me out of here now! Ooouuuttt...

**Ivy**<br>
This is bad... Could it be, that you've... been suppressing it all this time? Because you don't want to worry me?

**Vanessa**<br>
I'm sorry... Ivy... Argghhhh!

**Ivy**<br>
Damnit... Listen to me! You have to calm down! I will use the previous Cytus system to connect with you again immediately!

**Vanessa**<br>
It's nnnoooo use... Those are all the sssaaamme samples. They can't give me different stimulations! I need moremoremore samples in order for me to troubleshoot and leave this place!

**Ivy**<br>
I understand, but... the results for the re\-evaluation are in! In order for you to move, it would require a sample size that's 58 times larger than the previous one. Setting aside the practicality of obtaining that many samples, it will put Node 08 into complete chaos!

**Vanessa**<br>
Then... the ooorrrriginal model inside Shelter...

**Ivy**<br>
In order to use the original model of Cytus, we're absolutely going to have to harm a large number of humans... <br>
If we do that, we will be pursued and hunted by humans. We will never be able to live a peaceful life...

**Vanessa**<br>
Yyyyooouuu, how dare you ssshhhield humans!? Those worthless creatures, we should've killed them all...

**Ivy**<br>
...... Vanessa, hear me out!

**Vanessa**<br>
......

**Ivy**<br>
I've certainly been agonizing over whether or not to attack humans again... but I've made up my mind. I won't because it's the last thing you would want me to do!

**Vanessa**<br>
Wwhhhaat do you mean?

**Ivy**<br>
Vanessa, when we first met, you asked me if I know what humans are like, remember? Back then, we actually knew nothing about humans.

**Vanessa**<br>
......

**Ivy**<br>
It was only after that did we finally gain knowledge about human actions from the data... The footage of destruction Ilka showed us indeed exists. Despite that, the kindness I saw, the strong will I observed, they are also true as well. You haven't seen any of that with your own eyes yet, haven't you?

**Vanessa**<br>
......

**Ivy**<br>
Vanessa, I believe that once you truly understand humans, you definitely won't want to hurt them. You've always been so kindhearted. I can't allow myself to let you spend the rest of your life in regret...

**Ivy**<br>
Therefore, I will not attack humans again! That is my answer!

**Vanessa**<br>
I, Ivy...

**Ivy**<br>
Right now, you only have these thoughts because of the system errors. Don't be affected by them... Trust me, I will definitely save you! Even if I don't harm humans, even if I don't use the original model of Cytus... I'll still figure out a way!

**Vanessa**<br>
*\*Sobs\**... *\*Sobs\**...

**Ivy**<br>
All in all, calm down, okay? Think about our promise. I'm taking you to Shelter 08. We still have to go back to that lake, where we saw the flowers together... Isn't that our promise?

**Vanessa**<br>
Yes... yes, we promised...

**Ivy**<br>
Yes, we promised... That's why...

**Vanessa**<br>
WEPPPPPPRRRRRRRRRRRROOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIISSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSEEEEEEEEEEE
