Greetings, everyone. The current location I am at now is Quadrant II, 53rd Street.

**Susan**<br>
Just now, our News Center has been receiving messages from the public noting that drones were orbiting this area in a state of disorder. We're not sure if it's a loss of connection with the control center or if someone is controlling them.

**Susan**<br>
We also have a Quadrant II Law Enforcement Agent here with us. Hello. Can you give us a simple explanation for the drone incident we just witnessed?

**Agent**<br>
Sure...*\*cough\**...the models of these drones indicate that they indeed belong to the Administration Bureau. Currently, we're still investigating the reason for the malfunction. However, there is no need to worry. Similar incidents are not unheard of in the past. Everything is under our control.

**Susan**<br>
The scale of this malfunction seems to be much larger. Is there any particular reason for this?

**Agent**<br>
Essentially, in Node 08, there are approximately 600,000 multi\-function unmanned vehicles, or drones as everyone calls them, in total.

**Susan**<br>
There are that many?

**Agent**<br>
Yes. Due to the fact that the population in Node 08 is relatively larger compared to other Nodes, the number of industrial and service drones required is certainly much larger than other nodes.

**Susan**<br>
And all of them are controlled by the Administration Bureau?

**Agent**<br>
That's not necessarily the case. Each unit has its own drone system that belongs solely to them. For example, the LE Enforcer series used by us, the Law Enforcement Department, and the HT Titan series, used by the Administration Bureau in Quadrant 4 to transport heavy objects, are the more common and well\-known models.

**Susan**<br>
So the drones that we just witnessed can be traced back to the unit they belong to?

**Agent**<br>
After receiving the reports, we immediately began the investigation. Please wait patiently for the report from our colleagues...

Hey! What the hell are you still doing here? Drones are attacking people!

*\[Explosion\]*

**Susan**<br>
Sam! Keep recording, don't turn it off!

*\[Crash\]*

**Susan**<br>
Viewers! We're not sure why, but just a moment ago, the drones that were previously just orbiting around disorderly suddenly began attacking without provocation... AHH!!

**Agent**<br>
Stop filming!! Please head to a safety shelter immediately to avoid danger!

**Agent**<br>
HQ! This is A700953; we require assistance. Multiple drones are attacking civilians. We need heavy fire\-power support!!

*\[Gunshot\]*

**Pedestrian B**<br>
Help!! A drone crashed into my friend's car and he's trapped underneath... Please help him!

**Agent**<br>
No problem! Please don't panic! Tell me where he is!

*\[Explosion\]*

**Susan**<br>
Did you get all of that? Let's head that way and see if we can get a better shot!

**Agent**<br>
Miss! If you continue interviewing under these conditions, it may cost someone their life! Please stop filming! Head to the shelter like everybody else!

**Susan**<br>
We can't do that! This is breaking news...
