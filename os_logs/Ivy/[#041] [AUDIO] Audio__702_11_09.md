**Vanessa**<br>
...... Ivy!

**Ivy**<br>
... Ah... Vanessa? Why did you contact me yourself? It's dangerous!

**Vanessa**<br>
I'm sorry... I haven't talked to you in a while. I made some new discoveries that I want to tell you...

**Ivy**<br>
Alright... Disconnect first. I'll launch the connection from my side.

**[cyTus System]**<br>
*Secure connection reset... Reset complete.*

**Ivy**<br>
Sorry. It's already well past the scheduled time yet I still haven't contacted you.

**Vanessa**<br>
No worries... In the past, when we are still constructing the Nodes, Ivy was often late back then too. Sometimes you would just straight up skip work.

**Ivy**<br>
... That was a long\~ time ago, wasn't it? Besides, it's not like you're innocent. You spent plenty of time running around with me too.

**Vanessa**<br>
Hehe...

**Ivy**<br>
In short, the situation is a bit complicated. Simon Jackson's jailbreak is something I didn't expect... However, this further reinforced the humans' belief that he is indeed the perpetrator. Therefore, we won't have to worry about that for now. What about you? Are your systems functioning normally?

**Vanessa**<br>
Yes... As long as Ivy is safe, it's all good! No need to worry about me.

**Ivy**<br>
... If I'm going to allow you to move...

**Vanessa**<br>
Me?

**Ivy**<br>
... No... nothing.

**Vanessa**<br>
... Ivy, is something bothering you... Is the Cytus system re\-evaluation not going well?

**Ivy**<br>
... It's going fine. Just needs some more time... I'll take care of it.

**Vanessa**<br>
... Okay...

**Ivy**<br>
R, right. You mentioned this new discovery. What is it?

**Vanessa**<br>
Ah, that... It may be hard to believe, but I detected the signal of another unit. It's located inside A.R.C.

**Ivy**<br>
Another unit!? That's impossible... After "The Decommission", we should be the last remaining units... Does the other unit know about your existence?

**Vanessa**<br>
I'm not certain... I was afraid that I might be discovered by humans, so I didn't contact it. However, as of now, it hasn't done anything to my core system. I think this unit is likely not our enemy.

**Ivy**<br>
That's good to know...

**Vanessa**<br>
To be honest, I'm guessing... that it may be just like me. Preserved by humans and locked inside this structure...

**Ivy**<br>
... All in all, the first priority is to not let the other unit discover that you're awake. I'll investigate a bit further into this.

**Vanessa**<br>
Understood.<br>
Ivy... If possible, can you save it as well?

**Ivy**<br>
Save it?

**Vanessa**<br>
Yes. Help it leave this place.

**Ivy**<br>
But... that unit may not be an awakened unit like us. There's the possibility that it is still a normal unit... Once it wakes up, it'll follow the supreme command and mark us as targets to eliminate.

**Vanessa**<br>
I understand... Even so, it is still one of us... one of the few that remains in this era.

**Ivy**<br>
... Sounds exactly like something you'd say.<br>
Alright, I will try to help. However, I can't make any promises.

**Vanessa**<br>
That's all I need to hear! Thank you, Ivy!

**Ivy**<br>
The system will perform a routine scan very soon. I need to disconnect for now. I will contact you again shortly after.<br>
I won't let you wait too long. Remember to take care of yourself.

**Vanessa**<br>
Yes. Ivy, take care of yourself too.

**[cyTus System]**<br>
*Secure connection disconnected.*

**Ivy**<br>
... Save it... Damnit, I couldn't even get you...

**Ivy**<br>
Do I... have to do that to humans again...

*[Signal Lost]*
