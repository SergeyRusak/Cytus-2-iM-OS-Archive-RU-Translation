This is...... How long has it been...?

    Nothing but green... In my memory, this is a precious color, but all my eyes can see now are shrubs, moss, and vines. To a point where the sky is barely visible. 

    Have to go back soon. She is still waiting for me in the Shelter.

    However, before I go back...... there is one thing I must do first.
