**Agent A**<br>
Mr. Sagar, thanks for the hard work. Brought something interesting back again this time? 

*\[Animal Chirp\]*

**Agent B**<br>
Woah!? What is this!?

**Bruno**<br>
Hey, keep your distance, people.

**Agent B**<br>
Mr. Bruno... are you injured? Is it alright?

**Bruno**<br>
Yes, broke a few bones. However, nothing particularly serious.

**Sagar**<br>
This little guy seems to be a new species of "rock dove". We discover it on the way. It was wounded by a poacher's animal trap.

**Agent A**<br>
A new species, eh... that's incredible.

**Agent C**<br>
Scan complete. All clear. Please proceed to the next checkpoint. Mr. Sagar, please sign here.

**Sagar**<br>
Thank you.

**Bruno**<br>
Wait a second. Isn't the weight number off?

**Agent A**<br>
Is anything wrong with it? This is the weight recorded at the weigh station.

**Sagar**<br>
Bruno has a point. Our weight is 100 plus kilograms more than what we declared.

**Agent B**<br>
You're right... Apologies; I did not notice that.

**Alex**<br>
Did Lucy get off the car when we were going through the weigh station?

**Lucy**<br>
Die.

**Alex**<br>
OWWW! That really hurt!

**Sagar**<br>
Hey, don't mess around now\~ Excuse me, can you guys weigh us again?

*\[Weight scanning\]*

**Agent A**<br>
Eh? 102.5 kg less than the previous number...

**Sagar**<br>
......

**Bruno**<br>
What is going on?

**Sagar**<br>
Investigate the nearby area.

**Alex**<br>
Oyoy, are you implying that someone got inside here by following us?

**Sagar**<br>
Possibly. The additional weight also seems to match up as the weight of one person plus equipment.

**Lucy**<br>
If someone's hiding in the car, we wouldn't clear the scan in the first place, would we...

**Sagar**<br>
... A lot of weird things happened on the return trip. I have a bad feeling about this.<br>
Anyhow, turn on the alarm first.

*\[Alarm\]*

**[Security System]**<br>
*Report: Error detected. Please stay at your current position for now as we conduct the search and scan.*

**Alex**<br>
Seriously...?

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

**Agent A**<br>
Everything's normal. We weren't able to find anything odd...

**Bruno**<br>
Is it an issue with the weighing system?

**Alex**<br>
It is a pretty ancient system after all.

**Sagar**<br>
Well, I guess no news is good news... Sorry for wasting everyone's time.

*\[Animal Chirp\]*

**Sagar**<br>
Let's go back to A.R.C. Bruno and this little guy are both injured. They need to get treatment as soon as possible.
