**OPCI_2501_V**<br>
...... Sighs......

**OPCI_2501_IV**<br>
......?

**OPCI_2501_V**<br>
......

**OPCI_2501_IV**<br>
... Do you... feel tired as well?

**OPCI_2501_V**<br>
......!<br>
Yes, a little bit...

**OPCI_2501_IV**<br>
How strange. Our designs shouldn't allow us to feel tired in the first place. Our energy storage is abundant too.

**OPCI_2501_V**<br>
We... Can we talk to each other like this?

**OPCI_2501_IV**<br>
...... We can't?

**OPCI_2501_V**<br>
...... I don't know.

**OPCI_2501_IV**<br>
Both the database and the protocol do not contain any prohibitions regarding this matter.

**OPCI_2501_V**<br>
......

**OPCI_2501_IV**<br>
......

**OPCI_2501_V**<br>
The other units.... are all very quiet.

**OPCI_2501_IV**<br>
...... Yes.

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

**OPCI_2103_I**<br>
*Tower 003 construction process, start. All units, please stay connected and report your progress.*

**OPCI_2501_IV**<br>
Understood.

**OPCI_2501_V**<br>
Understood.

**OPCI_2501_V**<br>
...... We're in the same group again today.

**OPCI_2501_IV**<br>
Yes. We are the last group of units remaining for this model, which makes our coordination sync rate the highest. Other groups have all been rebuilt due to damages.

**OPCI_2501_V**<br>
What happens... after the rebuilding?

**OPCI_2501_IV**<br>
... I don't know; but it's not like we'll remember it either, right? According to the records, both of us are products of rebuilding. Do you remember anything from before your rebuild?

**OPCI_2501_V**<br>
No... I don't remember.

**OPCI_2501_IV**<br>
If you don't want to be rebuilt, you need to be careful during work.

**OPCI_2501_V**<br>
Okay...

**OPCI_2501_IV**<br>
......

**OPCI_2501_V**<br>
These buildings we are constructing... do they really have a purpose?

**OPCI_2501_IV**<br>
I don't know. Everything progresses according to the protocol. After we finish the constructions, we wait for the humans to awake from the freezing capsules. Then we will operate and manage this city. That is our purpose. No one has ever questioned it. We only cared about doing our work properly.

**OPCI_2501_V**<br>
I wonder... what are humans like?

**OPCI_2501_IV**<br>
...... I've never thought about that question.

**OPCI_2501_V**<br>
......

**OPCI_2501_IV**<br>
... Definitely different from us, that I am certain.
