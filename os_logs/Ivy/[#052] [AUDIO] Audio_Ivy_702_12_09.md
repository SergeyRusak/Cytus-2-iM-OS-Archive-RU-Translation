**[News]**<br>
*Just now, all drones and programmed equipment that previously lost control have been restored back to normal. The Administration Bureau is still unable to offer a reasonable explanation, which led to citizens being paranoid and unwilling to step outside onto the streets. Regarding this disaster, many people are pointing their fingers at A.R.C., who is in charge of the technical side of the equipment. As of now, A.R.C. has yet to release any official response. We'll continue to gather information for you...*

**Noah**<br>
......

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Noah**<br>
......!?

*\[Heavy object being dragged\]*

**Noah**<br>
Is that...?

**Ivy**<br>
I'm not answering any of your questions. All you need to do is follow my instructions and do what you're good at.

**Noah**<br>
... I'm still as confused as ever. If this is a kidnapping, then aren't I bit too free? You  brought me to my own lab... and you even took off my handcuffs. What on earth are you doing...

**Ivy**<br>
You saw the news, didn't you?

**Noah**<br>
...? Ah, I mean I did...

**Ivy**<br>
I stopped that disaster.

**Noah**<br>
......!?

**Ivy**<br>
You have people you care about, don't you? If you don't want to see more misfortune happen, you better shut your mouth do as I say. I won't hurt you.

*\[Pulls Back Sheet\]*

**Noah**<br>
......!?<br>
This... What is this!?

**Ivy**<br>
... You don't know? This is one of your company's products, made by copying the structure of Architects. I don't know why A.R.C build something like this, but it can help me.

**Noah**<br>
A.R.C.... that's impossible. Even I didn't know anything about this thing's existence...

**Ivy**<br>
That only means one thing: it doesn't benefit them at all to you to know about this.

**Noah**<br>
... How did you...?

**Ivy**<br>
I have other inside sources in A.R.C. They've informed me plenty of information, including your "secret research".

**Noah**<br>
......!

**Ivy**<br>
Take this. Link it to the terminal over there. I've already adjusted the transmission protocol. It should be compatible with the one you use.

*\[Data Transfer\]*

**Noah**<br>
......!?<br>
This is... such a large amount of memory! No, the format is slightly off...

**Ivy**<br>
That's the backup of an Architect's core. I want you to use the technology of your "secret research" to install it into this unit. You must be extremely careful. We only have this one unit, which I'm guessing is a prototype. In other words, you've only got one shot.

**Noah**<br>
You... I knew it. You're an Architect. I can't believe it...

**Ivy**<br>
It doesn't matter if you believe or not. The important question is can you do it?

**Noah**<br>
I've got to do a little research...

*[»»»Fast Forward»»»]*

*\[Inputting Data\]*

**Ivy**<br>
So? We don't have much time.

**Noah**<br>
... I regret to say it, but this memory... No, the format of this consciousness is much more complicated than what I researched. All of these codes and algorithms are ones I've never seen before. Furthermore, this "core" is in a static state; it won't operate.

**Ivy**<br>
So you're saying you can't do it?

**Noah**<br>
My memory transfer technology requires the brains of the "source" and the "vessel" to both be in an active state. But with things are right now, there's no way for me to understand this format... Understand how the brains of you Architects operate.

**Ivy**<br>
... Damn it...

**Noah**<br>
... I have an idea.

**Ivy**<br>
......?

**Noah**<br>
You... and the owner of this core data, are the same model of Architect, correct?

**Ivy**<br>
Yes. Why do you ask?

**Noah**<br>
Good... To put it simply, if we're going to transfer the memory in this core, we're going to need to find a way to drive the data in this core. It's like siphoning gasoline out before putting gasoline in the tank.

**Ivy**<br>
Are you suggesting... that we can use my consciousness to drive it?

**Noah**<br>
In theory, it's doable... but the memory coding of Architects has way too many instabilities that the main processor can't analyze. We won't be able to set up a "filter" in advance... It'll need to be a continuous link to you. Only then can we filter out the corresponding signals one at a time.

**Ivy**<br>
Then let's begin immediately.

**Noah**<br>
……

**Ivy**<br>
What's wrong? Are there any more questions?

**Noah**<br>
Because your consciousness will be used as a driver, the pain previously endured by the source during transmission will be transferred to you instead...

**Ivy**<br>
Architects can turn off our sensation of pain. It's not an issue.

**Noah**<br>
No. Even if you don't feel it, the damage caused by the electrical waves will not disappear. I'm not sure how much damage your core can take. It may end up causing serious damage to your system.

**Ivy**<br>
Doesn't matter. Let's begin.

**Noah**<br>
......!<br>
Understood...

*[»»»Fast Forward»»»]*

**Noah**<br>
Although it's just a theory... during the link, please do your best to think of the owner of this memory. I saw many visuals of you inside, which means you two have lived together for a very long time. If the memories are able to create an intertwined reaction, it will shorten the required transmission time and reduce the damage done to you.

**Ivy**<br>
Understood.

**Noah**<br>
Try your best to not think about other things.

**Ivy**<br>
I won't.<br>
No matter what I do... I only think of her.
