**Ivy**<br>
Vanessa, can you hear me?

**Vanessa**<br>
Ivy! I've been waiting for you... Are you alright?

**Ivy**<br>
Sorry. Human society has been in complete chaos for the past few days. I had to ensure that all clues were properly hidden... No need to worry. Humans have arrested the fake culprit. We are safe.

**Vanessa**<br>
You mean that Simon Jackson?

**Ivy**<br>
You knew about it?

**Vanessa**<br>
Yes. I found some news reports through encrypted connections... To be honest, it seems like I've been doing that even before I woke up. I would unconsciously observe human activity in the virtual internet space... A record is then stored in my database...

**Ivy**<br>
Sounds like an auto\-copy mechanism that triggers sporadically... After all, all data on the cyTus system passes through the Library you are currently located. Although it is encrypted, there is still the risk of being discovered since the connection occupies network traffic, so be careful.

**Vanessa**<br>
Okay...

**Ivy**<br>
Vanessa... You seem a bit down. Is something wrong?

**Vanessa**<br>
... Those images about human actions... After I woke up, they've become much clearer...

**Ivy**<br>
......

**Vanessa**<br>
When I was in my slumber, I just occasionally sensed them. But right now, I can see them all the time... It's like they are hiding in the shadows of my core...

**Vanessa**<br>
Hey Ivy, those... are all real, aren't they?

**Ivy**<br>
Yes, they are.<br>
The database in Node 08 has records for some, but most of the horrendous images and events are hidden in places where the general public could never have access to.

**Vanessa**<br>
Does the general public... know about this information?

**Ivy**<br>
They more or less have an idea. They're just unwilling to remember it, so they treat it as if it never existed... That's pretty much the case.

**Vanessa**<br>
Ivy, in my records, there are humans who are living happily. They travel to many places in the world. They get together to sing and dance... Yet at the same time, they are humans in some other places who are suffering. They are oppressed, exploited and destroyed by their own kin...

**Vanessa**<br>
IIIII feel, that such a contradictory creature will only bring tragedy... What Ilka said was very correct...

**Ivy**<br>
... Indeed. Humans have a habit of enjoying the present and ignoring the crimes committed by their own race. Even though there is still a small group of people who are willing to face the issues head\-on and reflect on the things that are lost...

**Vanessa**<br>
... I've been thinking, if I maintain my connection with the virtual internet network and infiltrate it from the inside, with the level of dependence humans have for it rrright nnnnnnow, it would be mmuch eeeeeeeasier to accomplish Ilka's goal. 

**Ivy**<br>
......!

**Vanessa**<br>
You also tttttthink this is viable, right? We are already unable to manage them anyway. It would be better to just aannihilate hhhhumans...

**Ivy**<br>
... Setting aside the possibility of that plan succeeding, you would have to stay here in order to carry it out. Keeping you under A.R.C.'s control is just way too dangerous... <br>
I will not allow such a thing to happen.<br>
Here, stop thinking about those things. 

**Vanessa**<br>
......? Think about what? Ivy?

**Ivy**<br>
... Nothing. The time limit for the secured connection is almost up. Vanessa, just hold on for a little longer. I will figure out a way to address your system errors in no time... and I will get you out of there.

**Vanessa**<br>
... Hehe...

**Ivy**<br>
What's the matter?

**Vanessa**<br>
When I hear you say my name, it reminds me of the past, when it was just you and me... Will we ever get to return to those days again...?

**Ivy**<br>
... I'm thinking, if I can figure out a way to take you out of Node, perhaps we can return to Shelter 08 first.

**Vanessa**<br>
Why?

**Ivy**<br>
The equipment there is already completely damaged. It has no value to humans. I knew about its condition through Shelter 32's system when I was looking for you in the forbidden area. I believe it's worth a shot.

**Vanessa**<br>
Shelter 32?

**Ivy**<br>
Yes. Due to its entrance being closed off for a long time, the equipment in 32 is all preserved in pretty good condition. Right now, humans have also set up a camp there for research purposes.

**Vanessa**<br>
......

**Ivy**<br>
All in all, if we return to Shelter 08, we should be able to live there safely for a short while.

**Vanessa**<br>
For a short while... is it?

**Ivy**<br>
......?

**Vanessa**<br>
Nothing. That sounds great! The lake we used to see flowers together, I wonder what it looks like now? You have to take me back. That's a promise between us.

**Ivy**<br>
Yes, it's a promise.
