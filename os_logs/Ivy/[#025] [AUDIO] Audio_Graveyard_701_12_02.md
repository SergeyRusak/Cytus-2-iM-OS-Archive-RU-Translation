**Ivy**<br>
Finally able to avoid those humans. However, what is this place...

**Ivy**<br>
Ah, a cemetery... It's so quiet.

**Girl**<br>
Daddy, is big sister not coming home with us? Is she still mad at me?

**Man**<br>
... No, that's not it, Vivi.

**Ivy**<br>
Somone's here...

*\[Walks closer\]*

**Girl**<br>
I will not ignore her anymore. I will even give her Mr. Doll! Daddy, tell big sister to not be mad anymore, can you? Don't lie down here anymore. We will go home...

**Man**<br>
... Vivi, listen carefully to what daddy has to say next.

**Girl**<br>
......

**Ivy**<br>
......?

**Girl**<br>
*\*Sobs\**... It's all my fault. It's because I've kept Mr. Doll all to myself; that's why big sister was mad. We promised that we would share it...... *\*Sniff\**......

**Man**<br>
Sister is not mad at you. She's just... gone. She passed away.

**Ivy**<br>
......!

**Girl**<br>
Gone...?<br>
Big sister, is she...... not coming back?

**Man**<br>
...... Yes.

*\[Sobs\]*

**Girl**<br>
... No... Don't go... I want sister...

**Man**<br>
Daddy is the same as you... as sad as you are. It's just... big sister can no longer be with us anymore.

*\[Sobs\]*

**Man**<br>
As long as we remember her, big sister will always be by our sides. Vivi, promise daddy that you'll remember big sister too, okay?

**Girl**<br>
*\*Cries\**

**Man**<br>
Here. We should go now. Give the flowers to big sister.

**Girl**<br>
...... OK......

*\[Footsteps\]*

**Ivy**<br>
......

**Ivy**<br>
... So humans... feel sadness from loss too?
