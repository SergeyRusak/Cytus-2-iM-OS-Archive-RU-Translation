*Thank you for using the "Basicpedia" service! Learner Ivy! What would you like to learn about today?*

**Ivy**<br>
...... Yet another Administration Bureau machine I've not seen before.<br>
Command code: 2501004. Provide me your serial number and motivation

**[Basicpedia 01]**<br>
*Command mode launch. Apologies, command code error. You do not have the access authorization.*

**Ivy**<br>
As I suspected... It doesn't work, does it...?

**[Basicpedia 01]**<br>
*Thank you for using the "Basicpedia" service! Learner Ivy! What would you like to learn about today?*

**Ivy**<br>
The OPCI machines... When did they disappear?

**[Basicpedia 01]**<br>
*That's a great question! Looks like we have a learner who is interested in history. <br>
The OPCI machine, is the main model for "Architects". They are intelligent robots that operated and managed Nodes in the past. They were also responsible for all kinds of construction projects. On N.A. 497/04/04, they completed their duty, which led to "The Decommission" and their subsequent disappearance. They left behind splendid architectures and societies that aided humans in their amazing development afterward. Their existence is great to this world! *

**Ivy**<br>
497...... This means that they did indeed once co\-exist with humans. So they've been gone for more than 200 years, have they...?

**[Basicpedia 01]**<br>
*The correct answer is 205 years, 9 months and 26 days!*

**Ivy**<br>
Completed their duty? That's impossible. The effective time period of the protocol is supposed to be permanent.

**[Basicpedia 01]**<br>
*Protocol? What kind of protocol would you like to search for?<br>
C\-Port protocol, transportation usage protocol, Housing item purchase/rent for adults protocol, music worker...*

**Ivy**<br>
"Hyperion Protocol".

**[Basicpedia 01]**<br>
*...... Apologies, no search results available for the designated keyword. You can try again using a broader condition.*

**Ivy**<br>
...... "Hyperion Protocol"; Humanity reconstruction project.

**[Basicpedia 01]**<br>
*Based on the "Humanity reconstruction project" keyword you inputted, 1214 results found. Of the results, the one with the highest relevance is the singleplayer game "Humans: Rebirth". The game's story...*

**Ivy**<br>
Incorrect.<br>
I'm referring to the construction project 700 years ago that rebuilt human civilization from its doom. The current Nodes and most of the architectures were also built according to the protocol.

**[Basicpedia 01]**<br>
*Learner, it seems that your history is not very good. The event you described doesn't exist in history.*

**Ivy**<br>
Is that so? Then how did the calendar "N.A. 700" came to be? What about civilization before that?

**[Basicpedia 01]**<br>
*Yes, before the New Age, Nodes and Architects didn't exist. As with the humans before that, although they have advanced technology, they were forced to reduce their area of survival due to the Earth's environment getting harsher and harsher. To solve this issue, they later invented the survival method of "Nodes". That's how they were able to achieve a balance and live in harmony with the planet once again. This calendar was established precisely to celebrate the arrival of that day. *

**Ivy**<br>
Incorrect.<br>
Humans were eliminated by "The Ender" virus. This is the true reason why "Shelters" and "Architects" exist. The virus was not caused by nature either...... Does "The Ender" exist within your database?

**[Basicpedia 01]**<br>
*Yes. The Ender virus is indeed one of the key reasons why humans couldn't survive in the forbidden area. However, the description you just said contains multiple errors. They don't exist in history. Learner, you need to study harder!*

**Ivy**<br>
... What is this nonsense? Even history is altered as well? Do the current humans really believe this pile of gibberish...?

**Ivy**<br>
No, humans never cared about history in the first place. Or else, they wouldn't have repeated the same mistakes so many times...

**[Basicpedia 01]**<br>
*Learner, history is absolute! It is not altered! You won't be able to pursue the real answers with an attitude like this!*

**Ivy**<br>
Alright, forget it. I won't ask about history anymore. Can you tell me what is "cyTus"?

**[Basicpedia 01]**<br>
*"cyTus", more commonly referred to as "virtual internet", is an internet system developed by the A.R.C. tech company. It's the best example of humans combining with technology! Through a chip that is simultaneously connected to the brain, it's a system that creates a virtual space that allows its users' senses to be shared! In this space, users can enjoy the senses of see, hear, smell, taste and even touch that is almost identical to real life! It's safe to call it the epitome of virtual reality!*

**Ivy**<br>
...... What is "A.R.C."?

**[Basicpedia 01]**<br>
*A.R.C. stands for "Institute of Ancient Ruin Civilization". It's a technology/development company that was founded in Node 08 on N.A. 499/01/01. It provides the citizens of Node with the most convenient technology products and applications! After developing the "cyTus" service, they've further become the prime leader of technology in the entire world!*

**Ivy**<br>
Develop......? That's not right? How did they develop it?

**[Basicpedia 01]**<br>
*In N.A. 690, under the "Ancient civilization technology research project", the "Library" was excavated. With that, A.R.C. obtained the method that realizes this technology. Subsequently, in N.A. 693, they successfully developed the service and made it available to Node citizens across the whole world! It's amazing, right!*

**Ivy**<br>
Excavation... Exploration team.<br>
... Where did they excavate it from?

**[Basicpedia 01]**<br>
*Apologies. This information is a trade secret. Basicpedia does not have the authorization to answer this question! QQ\~*

**Ivy**<br>
... Where is this Library currently located?

**[Basicpedia 01]**<br>
*It is stored inside the A.R.C. headquarters "A.R.C. Sky". Tours are available every Monday and Friday during business hours\~ Ah, but learner, you won't be able to see Library itself. After all, it is an extremely precious facility!*

**Ivy**<br>
......

**[Basicpedia 01]**<br>
*Learner, you have reached the usage limit for the money you inserted. Do you still want to learn about more things?*

**Ivy**<br>
... No, that's enough.

**[Basicpedia 01]**<br>
*Glad to share knowledge with you. Bye\-bye\~*
