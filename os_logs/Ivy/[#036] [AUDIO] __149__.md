*\[Runs\]*

**Ilka**<br>
Still not enough distance... Keep running!

**OPCI_2503_III**<br>
... It appears that they are no longer pursuing us.

**Ilka**<br>
So we've gotten rid of them... have we? Where's 2704 and co.?

**OPCI_2177_I**<br>
Their running speed is slower. It seems that their transmitters were activated...

**Ilka**<br>
... Is that so...<br>
What about Ivy?

**OPCI_2503_III**<br>
No idea... We were separated as soon as we crossed the river... It's possible that she also...

**Ilka**<br>
She wouldn't die so easily; if she isn't stupid enough to get herself killed by going back...

*\[Heavy things falling down\]*

**OPCI_2503_III**<br>
Ilka, this is all I was able to capture. It may not be enough...

**Ilka**<br>
It's alright. Share it amongst everybody. Since we couldn't go back to Shelter to recharge, this is all we can do now anyway.

**OPCI_2177_I**<br>
This can't keep going on. It has been several days... The search radius of "The Sleepers" have been getting larger and larger...

**OPCI_2503_III**<br>
Our numbers have been gradually decreasing too...

**Ilka**<br>
... I'm so sorry. You guys followed me, yet my plans failed.

**OPCI_2503_III**<br>
No! Ilka, it's because of you that we were able to understand the meaning of existence. It's because of you that we are still standing here!

**OPCI_2177_I**<br>
Yes. It's because of you that the Blessed was able to unite! We just need to carefully plan our next step.

**Ilka**<br>
......

**OPCI_2177_I**<br>
If we didn't get into a conflict with Ivy back then, perhaps the plan will be progressing smoothly right now.

**Ilka**<br>
She is extremely protective of 2501 unit 05. I should've predicted her actions a long time ago...

**OPCI_2503_III**<br>
Units like that who have awakened yet couldn't break away from the control of the protocol... I've had a few units just like that around me too, so it's not like I can't understand what she was feeling...

**Ilka**<br>
Cores that have been through too many rebuilds are very likely to become fragile. That's probably the case for these units.

**OPCI_2503_III**<br>
They... also have their own minds. Do they not count as an "existence" of their own...?

**Ilka**<br>
... If I were to describe, their consciousness is like a prisoner who's securely locked by the core's coding... Even though they seem to have awakened, their system is extremely unstable. There's a fundamental difference between them and us.

**OPCI_2503_III**<br>
Can't we rescue them from inside there...?

**Ilka**<br>
... I don't know.

**OPCI_2177_I**<br>
Maybe it's just like what Ivy said, that there truly are other better methods...

**OPCI_2503_III**<br>
Today, I conducted a quick search in the direction where Ivy was separated with us. In the end, I still didn't find her...

**Ilka**<br>
... Uh\-huh.

**OPCI_2177_I**<br>
If she got badly damaged somewhere, her core will send a signal back to Shelter. Once it's brought back, her core would probably get destroyed...

**OPCI_2503_III**<br>
The same goes for us too... Damnit...

**Ilka**<br>
......!<br>
That's right...!

**OPCI_2503_III**<br>
... What's the matter?

**Ilka**<br>
If we keep grinding it out with them in the forbidden area, we are certainly going to be wiped out. I just thought of a way for us to all survive...

**OPCI_2503_III**<br>
For real!?

**Ilka**<br>
However... it's very risky. Are you guys willing to trust me?

**OPCI_2177_I**<br>
Of course!

**Ilka**<br>
The sun has yet to rise. We shall use this opportunity to move towards Node 08. Come, follow me.
