The virtual internet "cyTus" system that has been rewritten by humans... It's not that easy to hack into it. However, I observed quite a bit of useful information when I infiltrated A.R.C. HQ. Thus, it's not an undoable task for me either. It won't take me long to finally get a peek at when they are hiding inside their so\-called "Library".
