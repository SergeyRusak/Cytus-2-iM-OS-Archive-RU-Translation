**JOE**<br>
I've checked the products. 15 crates, all in perfect condition.<br>
I just moved them to wasteland 07. They are so heavy... I've already sent you the location. Go pick them up yourself.

**[I]**<br>
*I thought we need to meet in person to retrieve the products.*

**JOE**<br>
Haha, when doing business, the simpler, the better! If you got the money, I'll get you covered!<br>
This payment is quite large. Are you going to launder the money in batches before transferring them to me?

**[I]**<br>
*The money will appear in your account later. Just wait a few minutes.*

**JOE**<br>
......!? Dude, you need to launder that s\*\*\* before sending it to me! Folks will get suspicious if they see this much money being transferred! Are you trying to get me busted!? 

**[I]**<br>
*Rest assured. This is not a "transfer". Therefore, it will leave no records.*

**JOE**<br>
How did you get this big of a sum pass... Forget it. I won't ask too much. It seems that you're not just some random goon either...

**[I]**<br>
......

**JOE**<br>
......

**JOE**<br>
... Umm, I know I said that I won't ask, but I'm gonna ask anyway. You hired folks to steal all these A.R.C. equipment...  this signal amplifier crap... What do you plan to do?

**[I]**<br>
*I thought you aren't the type who cares about these things?*

**JOE**<br>
... Yeah, you have a point. But you don't seem to be associated with the gangs. Just want to remind you about some of the rules here. If we go overboard with this s\*\*\* we'll catch the admins' attention. That would be quite the pain in the a\*\* for me as well.

**[I]**<br>
......

*\[System notification\]*

**JOE**<br>
Whatever, forget that I said anything... The money is here; that's what's important. Lemme take a look...

**JOE**<br>
Eh? The amount is higher than what we agreed on... Did you type in the wrong number? I won't give you any refunds though?

**[I]**<br>
*About the extra portion, I just feel like giving you more.*

**JOE**<br>
......?<br>
Then I shall accept it with glee! Latest effects unit model, you're coming home with me, hahaha! <br>
We should know each other better. Visit my shop someday and I'll treat you to a drink...

**[cyTus System]**<br>
*I has logged out of the block*

**JOE**<br>
Oh, he's gone. What a weirdo... Paying me so much... Did he owe me a favor of some sort in the past?

*\[Drinks \]*

**JOE**<br>
...... Have absolutely no idea who he is. Whatever. Hahahaha!
