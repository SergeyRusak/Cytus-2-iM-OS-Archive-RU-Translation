.......<br>
... Uggghhh...

**???**<br>
......

*\[Electric Shock\]*

**Noah**<br>
Waaahhh!

**Noah**<br>
... What's going on... I... I should be at home...<br>
This... What is this place?

**???**<br>
I advise you don't try anything rash.

**Noah**<br>
Who... Who are you!?

*\[Electric Shock\]*

**Noah**<br>
Ahhhhh! ... Ugh...

**???**<br>
The bracelet I put on you will electrify the nerves in your wrist. The resulting pain and paralysis will leave you unable to move... As long as you don't try to resist, I won't hurt you. Take a seat.

**Noah**<br>
... Uhh...

**???**<br>
Your name is Noah Black. Director of the A.R.C. research department "zero". Specialized field of study is brainwave research. 38 years old, married. Your wife Helena Black is the older sister and agent of the idol singer PAFF... PAFF...

**???**<br>
... What a coincidence. Perhaps this is what humans refer to as "fate"?

**Noah**<br>
I don't understand what you're talking about... "zero" is a highly classified secret in the company. How did you know this name?

**???**<br>
I have an information source inside A.R.C.<br>
"zero" is directly under the higher\-ups. It's a research organization that merely exists for their personal profits. Yet as director, you questioned them, which led to you being given the cold shoulder... Correct?

**Noah**<br>
......

**???**<br>
On top of that, your research was forcefully terminated as well. All the data archived in the deepest corner of the A.R.C. servers. Not even my source could access it.

**???**<br>
In other words... you're the only one who knows the whole picture of that technology.

**Noah**<br>
You... who... who exactly are you!?

**???**<br>
You don't remember? I was a bit rough when I took you away, but I made sure not to use too much force. It shouldn't cause any memory impairment...

**Noah**<br>
There's... blood on my head...<br>
... I remember now. I was at my home... Where's Helena!?

**???**<br>
Rest assured. I drugged your wife to make her temporarily unconscious. She didn't even know that you were taken away... You're my only target.

**Noah**<br>
You... what do you want me for? Why did you take me here?<br>
T\-this is a crime! I'm leaving...

*\[Electric Shock\]*

**Noah**<br>
UAAGGGHHH!!

*\[Things crashing\]*

**???**<br>
Noah, that incomplete technology is already far ahead of this era. You understand this better than anyone else... In order to complete it, I believe you won't let go of the slightest of opportunities, and that's exactly what I want.

**Noah**<br>
Ugh... Uhh, my... research...?

**???**<br>
... You're going to assist me.
