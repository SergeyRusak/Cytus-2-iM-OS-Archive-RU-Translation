**[Cytus System]**<br>
*All units, proceed to Cytus mainframe for connection. Initiate emotion synchronization and troubleshoot.*

**OPCI_2501_IV**<br>
Unit 05, come over here.

**OPCI_2501_V**<br>
Eh? But it's already time for synchronization...

**OPCI_2501_IV**<br>
It'll be just a minute. Come.

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

**OPCI_2501_V**<br>
... This place is...?

**OPCI_2501_IV**<br>
I really like this place. Whenever I feel stressed, coming here helps me relieve that stress quite a bit.

**OPCI_2501_V**<br>
... What a beautiful place.

**OPCI_2501_IV**<br>
Right?

**OPCI_2501_IV**<br>
......

**OPCI_2501_V**<br>
Eh......?<br>
...... Unit 04? What are you doing?

**OPCI_2501_IV**<br>
Placing a flower on your head. Take a look at your reflection on the water. <br>
It looks pretty, doesn't it?

**OPCI_2501_V**<br>
Yes... But... is there any meaning for this action?

**OPCI_2501_IV**<br>
I don't know... However, in the database, I saw humans doing this. Two people would look closely at each other... So this must have some sort of important meaning, right?

**OPCI_2501_V**<br>
So pretty...... This flower...... I wonder what it's called?

**OPCI_2501_IV**<br>
Can't analyze it. We aren't inputted with knowledge regarding this field of study.

**OPCI_2501_V**<br>
Perhaps units that are related to gardening will know?

**OPCI_2501_IV**<br>
Perhaps. But I don't really want to interact with other units.

**OPCI_2501_V**<br>
Why......?

**OPCI_2501_IV**<br>
...... No particular reason. I have you; that's plenty enough for me.

**OPCI_2501_V**<br>
......<br>
After humans wake up, I wonder if we can still be like this...

**OPCI_2501_IV**<br>
...... No idea. However, I've always felt like the "Hyperion Protocol"...... It was supposedly inputted at the most basic level of our core, yet I always get this urge... the urge to disobey it...

**OPCI_2501_V**<br>
......<br>
Previously, you asked me whether or not I remember anything from before my rebuild. Afterward, I tried to run a detailed search of my core...

**OPCI_2501_IV**<br>
And the results?

**OPCI_2501_V**<br>
Well... as expected, didn't find anything. However, there's this one term. It has no connection to any other file, nor do I have any impression of seeing it before. I am not certain what it is...

**OPCI_2501_IV**<br>
What is it?

**OPCI_2501_V**<br>
...... Vanessa.

**OPCI_2501_IV**<br>
......?<br>
What does it mean?

**OPCI_2501_V**<br>
I don't know. Despite that, whenever I see that term... I get this feeling I can't quite describe.

**OPCI_2501_IV**<br>
Vanessa...... Sounds like a human's name.

**OPCI_2501_V**<br>
Name?

**OPCI_2501_IV**<br>
Humans all have names, given by either themselves or by someone else. It's a method for them to identify each other.

**OPCI_2501_V**<br>
They don't use serial numbers?

**OPCI_2501_IV**<br>
It's for personality and uniqueness, I suppose? They believe that every single human is a one\-of\-a\-kind individual.

**OPCI_2501_V**<br>
One\-of\-a\-kind... then it's a bit similar to us.

**OPCI_2501_IV**<br>
......?

**OPCI_2501_V**<br>
I think Unit 04 is one\-of\-a\-kind too.

**OPCI_2501_IV**<br>
...... Yes, you are very special to me too. Ah, how about we refer to each other using names as well? Just like how humans did.<br>
From now on, I will call you Vanessa.

**Vanessa**<br>
Hmm... I'm okay with that.<br>
What about you?

**OPCI_2501_IV**<br>
Unit 04...... IV...... Call me Ivy then.

**Vanessa**<br>
OK. Ivy.

**Ivy**<br>
Vanessa.

**Ivy**<br>
Our relationship... If this is a human society, then we're like "sisters".

**Vanessa**<br>
Sisters?

**Ivy**<br>
It's a little hard to explain...

*[→Signal Switches]*

**Ivy**<br>
From the perspective of human bloodlines...

**OPCI_2404_IL**<br>
... New members of "The Blessed"...
