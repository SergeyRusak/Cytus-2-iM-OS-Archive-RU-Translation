**Sagar**<br>
Sorry, I got delayed with some things. Big B, how's the preparation going?

**Alex**<br>
Bambi! You're the only one who's late. Don't waste my time, okay?

**Bruno**<br>
All members of Eagle\-01 are ready and on standby now, captain.

**Sagar**<br>
Good. I'll do the mission briefing first. Everyone, attention!

*\[Footsteps\]*

**Sagar**<br>
The mission this time is to hunt down a wanted criminal. The target is Colin Neumann Jr., who made an unauthorized departure from A.R.C. at the start of this month and has lost contact ever since. The detailed information has already been sent to everyone via the system. Check the information in your own time once the mission starts.

**Sagar**<br>
The lab folks are currently analyzing the target's personal items. They'll be able to figure out the possible whereabouts of the target soon. We'll go to the outside areas first. Once we receive the instructions, we can conduct the search and arrest right away. Alright, here is the target's appearance.

*\[Projection\]*

**Alex**<br>
Isn't this the rickety old man we rescued from Shelter 13 in the past? What a lame mission. We should get this done in no time, right?

**Bruno**<br>
Don't underestimate him, Jackal. Target is a criminal that has been conducting illegal excavation for an extensive amount of time. To him, operating outside the nodes isn't any more difficult than eating and drinking.<br>
Previously, we were able to catch him because he was badly injured. Do not overlook this man.

**Alex**<br>
Is there really a point being so nervous about a crippled geezer?

**Lucy**<br>
Captain, may I ask a question?

**Sagar**<br>
Go ahead.

**Lucy**<br>
Target is highly dangerous. Although the mission requires us to bring him into custody alive, if the situation becomes dire, is eliminating the target on the spot a viable option?

**Alex**<br>
Hoho, I like that suggestion, Miss Freeze! I second that! That'll make this mission a lot more fun!

**Sagar**<br>
Even though that's not what I desire... your judgment is indeed reasonable, Lucy. Avoid using lethal force unless it's absolutely necessary. If the safety of a teammate or yourself is threatened, proceed with the elimination only after my permission. You good with that?

**Lucy**<br>
Understood.

**Bruno**<br>
......

**Sagar**<br>
If there are no other questions, get ready to leave as soon as we complete one last equipment check.

**Team Member**<br>
Yes, captain!

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

**Bruno**<br>
Captain, we're almost ready to leave.

**Sagar**<br>
Good work. I'm almost done with my preparations as well.

**Bruno**<br>
One more thing, Captain...

**Sagar**<br>
What? This is not a public occasion; no need to beat around the bush like this.

**Bruno**<br>
Sorry, old habits die hard... Then I'll be frank. I know that captain has always been an associate of the target. You two seem to get along pretty well?

**Sagar**<br>
... You really are sharp. I certainly do respect his professionalism and fearlessness as an archaeologist deeply... At the very least, he's got a lot more balls than those folks up there.

**Bruno**<br>
Those remarks... are pretty risky, aren't they?

**Sagar**<br>
Then pretend you never heard them.<br>
Despite my respect for him, in the end, he is still a criminal and his methods are far too dangerous. As the captain of the top exploration team, our actions need to be measured and not go overboard. I believe everybody feels the same way too.

**Bruno**<br>
... If you don't count Jackal, that is.

**Sagar**<br>
What, you still haven't gotten used to that guy's BS? No need to worry. Throw a few bugs onto his back and he'll be tamer than a frightened bunny.

**Alex**<br>
What!? What bug!? Where is it!? I'm gonna squash it ASAP!

**Sagar**<br>
... See.<br>
Alright, let's get ready to move.

*\[Explosion\]*

**Sagar**<br>
!? What's going on? That's the direction of the residential area...

**Bruno**<br>
... Sounds like the explosion noises of "Lava" high explosive rounds. Only the LE Enforcer series of drones are equipped with this type of ammunition... So yet another malfunction with the drones?

**Sagar**<br>
Damnit, and here I thought the higher\-ups had already figured out the reason...

**Lucy**<br>
Captain!

*\[Hurried Footsteps\]*

**Lucy**<br>
The Administration Bureau's control system has fallen into complete chaos. They are unable to deploy the unaffected drones to handle the situation. An emergency call\-out has been issued to Law Enforcement Agents, but it doesn't seem like they'll make it in time.

**Alex**<br>
Those worthless idiots don't even know how to properly use a gun. How can you expect anything from them? By the time we get back, this city will probably have a few new giant craters. Hahaha.

**Bruno**<br>
Jackal! Save your unfunny jokes for another time!

**Sagar**<br>
......

**Bruno**<br>
Captain?

**Alex**<br>
Sigh\~ Here we go again...<br>
Bambi, we still have work to do. This is none of our business. The sooner we leave the city the...

**Sagar**<br>
Everyone, attention!

**Alex**<br>
... And I'm one step too late...

**Sagar**<br>
Emergency change of plans! Everyone, proceed to Quadrant II immediately! The target is to destroy all malfunctioned drones and protect the civilians!
