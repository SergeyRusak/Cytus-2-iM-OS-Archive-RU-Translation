## Log Content
Been six days since I woke up, and I haven't even made it out of the jungle... It appears that the distance is much further than I imagined. It seems like there is no end to the wall of green. Fortunately, food sources are abundant. 

    When I woke up this morning, the creature I rescued last time was staring at me while hiding behind a tree. The moment I turn my head, it immediately ducks back behind the tree; but then it quickly peeks out again with an expression filled with curiosity. No matter where I go, whenever I turn around, I can always see it.

    Just now, when I was eating, I tried to approach it by tossing it a fruit. It ate the fruit very quickly. After it was full, it stretched its wings, lied down, and started sleeping loudly.  It showed no caution towards me at all, like I'm someone he's very familiar with. 

    Looking at it, I'm getting sleepy as well. That's it for today.
