**BJ**<br>
From the skies to the sewers, exposing truths for everyone to see. Welcome to the "Truth Digger 101" segment. I am your host, Bob Jackson. <br>
The hottest topic in the nooks and crannies of every Node these days is, surprisingly, a single individual. It's none other than the mysterious music genius Æsir.<br>
 Is it his charisma or some sort of unique background he has?<br>
 How was he able to go from a previously unknown nobody to a household megastar in the span of what seems like an instant, yet maintain a low\-profile and not expose himself to the public at the same time?

**BJ**<br>
Today, we've invited several guests from the industry to join us and discuss this topic. First, let us welcome CEO of Monophonic Entertainment from Node 08, Mr. Jason Suzuki. Mr. Suzuki, can you do a quick analysis for us?

**J.Suzuki**<br>
Greetings, BJ. Hello, audience members watching. First of all, we must understand, that getting famous in the entertainment industry is in fact extremely tough. There were a lot of people who were discovered by scouts and have actual talent. In the end, even they are required to go through countless challenges and market tests before finally taking the stage. 

**BJ**<br>
Exactly! This is also why later in the show, we would like to ask CEO about this aspect particularly. What kind of person with what kind of background, or rather, what professional ability does a person, or maybe even group, need in order to have this meteoric rise in fame in that short amount of time. Æsir's internet volume has gotten to a level that even major corporations like Monophonic Entertainment are falling far behind. 

**J.Suzuki**<br>
This Æsir person was able to spread his works in a very short amount of time. It is very likely that he set up cyber warriors in each major internet block in advance. At his command, these warriors would immediately spring into action and spread the information out simultaneously, like a virus. Also, he took a "free" approach in terms of his pricing strategy. I believe that a large number of people were attracted to his music because of this. 

**BJ**<br>
Very well. However, appreciating music is like ordering food. Today, even if there's free food right in front of you, if it tastes horrible, you may just spit it out after a single bite too, not to mention recommending it to other people. Then, what are the opinions of someone who actually heard his music? Let us welcome Node 03's virtual internet observer, Mr. Eason Chen, to share his thoughts with everybody.

**Eason Chen**<br>
Hey, BJ, I feel like you just mentioned a crucial point. Right now, you can already say that Æsir's music is providing spiritual redemption for many people...

**BJ**<br>
Eason, have you listened to it?

**Eason Chen**<br>
I have. Of course I have listened to it. If I didn't, I wouldn't be here to talk about it today. <br>
To put it simply, what kind of music can truly touch the deepest part of your soul; what kind of music can truly resonate with your heartbeat. Right now, Æsir has become a revolution leader for the modern audience who are disappointed in the mainstream music industry for constantly pumping out the same old stuff! 

**J.Suzuki**<br>
That's not correct. According to our observations, there is no such thing as the so\-called "disappointment". The situation about music being "the same old stuff" is not true either. <br>
Today, it's simply a case of audiences trying out a new thing on top of the fact that it has no acquisition cost...

**BJ**<br>
Well, well, CEO, you seem to really oppose what Eason described just now. However, we should let Eason finish sharing his thoughts about Æsir's music first.

**Eason Chen**<br>
BJ, you know, to the average consumer, listening to all those mass\-produced lifeless sounds, the "top singers" who are complete hacks without post\-production, as well as the utterly insincere arrangements are already plenty enough to drive you mad. Then we get massive corporations like Mono that has abundant resources at their disposal. They dare to say stuff like "Well\-crafted", "Three years in the making" in their promotion materials. If you ask me, this can totally count as a case of serious fraud. 

**J.Suzuki**<br>
This...

**Eason Chen**<br>
Æsir's music is a type of reflection and introspection of human nature. I suggest to you, BJ, that after this show is over, you come to my home and listen to his music using a surround sound stereo system. You need to experience this feeling of the music resonating with your soul. If it's required, I can play PAFF's latest single right afterward. I bet it'll give you a deep understanding of the industry nonsense I just mentioned. 

**BJ**<br>
From what I've heard, it seems to have a similar effect to digital drugs. However, the difference is that this is harmless to the human body. If we look at it this way, we can understand why Æsir's music is as widespread as it is now. We've also prepared a special Æsir video to share with our audiences later. Everyone, get a sneak peek into the glory of this newest urban legend.  Mr. CEO, after the shooting for this show is over, do you want to go to Mr. Eason Chen's home to evaluate the music as well?

**J.Suzuki**<br>
Ummm... O, okay. Thank you two for the invitation.
