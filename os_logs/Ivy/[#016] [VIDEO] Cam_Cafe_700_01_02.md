Hick... Aww~ I love you so much~

**JOE**<br>
Yeah yeah yeah~ I love you too. Now f\*\*\* off.

*\[Doorbell\]*

**JOE**<br>
Today is finally over~

**Zark**<br>
Arf!

**JOE**<br>
What? If you have nothing then be quiet.

**Zark**<br>
Arf! Arf arf!

**JOE**<br>
The back door? What's wrong? Are the stray dogs digging around the trash again? Did you really think that every stray dog is the same as you?

**JOE**<br>
Woah!? Why is there a person lying here?...... A woman? Is she drunk?

**Zark**<br>
Arf Arf!

**JOE**<br>
No wait... she fainted! If the patrols see this I'm gonna be in trouble...<br>
Oof! What the f\*\*\* is wrong with this chick!? Why is she so heavy?

**？？？**<br>
Yo, JOE. Is the shipment here?

**JOE**<br>
Yep, it is. Sitting in the basement, safe and sound.

**？？？**<br>
Hey, why is there a dark\-skinned chick lying on the couch? Oh, don't tell me, you're into that kind of fetish...

**JOE**<br>
Wrong, you idiot. I just discovered her outside my back door, unconscious... I have no idea what happened to her.

**？？？**<br>
Ha, yeah yeah, nice story.<br>
Ah, right. Besides getting the shipment, I also want to order some Martini, three olives. You ok with that?<br>


**JOE**<br>
Why do you have to cause me trouble every time by ordering when I've already locked the cash register... Fine, go ahead. Only stuff within three weeks though.

**？？？**<br>
Ummm... there's a girl here. I'm a bit embarrassed to talk about this in front of her...

**JOE**<br>
I told you she fainted. She won't hear a thing.

**？？？**<br>
You come over here and I'll whisper it to you...<br>
......<br>
...... You got any?

**JOE**<br>
... Hah? You're asking this with a Martini? Do you have too much money to throw away? You can just visit the Academy's library and ask "Basicpedia"! <br>
If it's general knowledge, you can find it there. Did you not know about that?

**？？？**<br>
No, that's not it. I want the more special kind...<br>
......<br>
...... This kind.

**JOE**<br>
Pfft hahaha! Wow, you disgusting perv. How dare you lecture me about fetishes? Alright, if that's what you're looking for, then it's certainly within our services. I will ask about it for you.<br>
Here, this one's the down payment. Order another one after the transaction is complete.

**？？？**<br>
I shall leave it to you then!<br>
Oh, one more thing; don't tell anybody about this!

**JOE**<br>
Here, you can purchase anything. The only thing you can't is a customer's privacy... unless someone pays more money than you. 

**？？？**<br>
......

**JOE**<br>
Rest assured. No one is going to be interested in the fetishes of a nobody like you. Haha! Come down here and get your shipment.

**？？？**<br>
Thanks!

**JOE**<br>
Walk yourself out~

**Zark**<br>
ARF!

**JOE**<br>
Ah, right. Time to check out that girl...... Eh? She's gone!? ...... And she didn't forget to finish the food and water I gave her. Not a single crumb left... You're welcome.

**Zark**<br>
Arf Arf!

**JOE**<br>
What? Why are you so noisy today? ......Eh ......? AHHH!! The money in my tip box! Why are they all gone!? Damnit, it must be that girl! If I knew this would happen, I wouldn't have helped her. <br>
Sighs~ this sucks...
