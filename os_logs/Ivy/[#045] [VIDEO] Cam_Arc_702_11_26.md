**Rin**<br>
Sagar!

**Sagar**<br>
I brought the flowers you requested.

**Rin**<br>
Wow! So many species I've never seen before! Thank you!

**Sagar**<br>
Next time, try to cut down on non\-mission requests like this, okay... I had to hide from the guys and find these in secret.

**Rin**<br>
I, I'm sorry...

**Sagar**<br>
Haha, it's alright. I'm used to it.<br>
... Ah, one more thing. Dr. Neumann... he ran away?

**Rin**<br>
Yes... I don't really know the details either. I only knew about it after watching the news.

**Sagar**<br>
Why do you seem a bit upset?

**Rin**<br>
After all, he's one of the very few people besides you who visits this analysis room. He also chats with me quite a lot. I cannot leave this place, so I can't help but feel a bit lonely...

**Sagar**<br>
Rin, he's a criminal. Didn't I tell you that you need to be cautious around him...?

**Rin**<br>
I know... but... he doesn't appear to be a bad person.

**Sagar**<br>
Whatever. You mentioned before that he once left a watch here, right?

**Rin**<br>
Yes. Is something wrong with that?

**Sagar**<br>
The higher\-ups have put our squad in charge of hunting him down in the outside areas... *\*Sigh\**, I really don't want to deal with him... Do you still remember the mechanisms of that watch? Handmade mechanical watches are not that common nowadays. Maybe we can get some clues by investigating it.

**Rin**<br>
I've scanned everything that has come into this room. I can project it right away.

**Sagar**<br>
Ho? How convenient. I expect no less from you.

**Sagar**<br>
... That bastard! He installed a wiretap inside... Damnit, he may have heard our conversation.

**Rin**<br>
...... Eh?

**Sagar**<br>
However... good, these parts are all very unique. As long as we can figure out their place of origin, we should be able to locate his whereabouts.

**Rin**<br>
Ah, are you leaving already?

**Sagar**<br>
Yes. Please analyze the data we brought back this time as well. Our next return trip might be two weeks later.

**Rin**<br>
I see...

**Sagar**<br>
Hey... Don't give me that look. How can I leave when you show me a face like that?

**Rin**<br>
Ah, whew! It's okay. I'll keep working hard!

**Sagar**<br>
... Rin, one day, you'll be able to leave here and live a normal life. I promise you.

**Rin**<br>
I'm very happy with the life I have now. Thank you, hehe.

**Sagar**<br>
Then I'll take my leave.

**Rin**<br>
Ah... Sagar! There's one more thing...

**Sagar**<br>
Hmm?

**Rin**<br>
Recently... weird outside connections have constantly been appearing near the Library's main server.

**Sagar**<br>
The Library? How did you know?

**Rin**<br>
I... just know. You understand, right?

**Sagar**<br>
... So it has something to do with that? Does anyone within the company know about this?

**Rin**<br>
No, I believe it's just me. On top of that, some of the signals were even targeted at me. However, I was terrified, so I didn't respond to any of them...

**Sagar**<br>
......

**Rin**<br>
I don't want to worry you. That's why I've been hesitant to tell you about this...

**[Alex]**<br>
*Sagar! What the hell are you doing? It's meetup time already! Aren't you supposed to be the captain!?*

**Sagar**<br>
Woah! Gotcha! I'll be right there!<br>
Rin, I must go now... The thing you just mentioned, if it happens again, you must inform me. Understand?

**Rin**<br>
Yes... I understand. Take care.
