*Everyone in the tour, are you ready? <br>
We are about to board the gravity transporter to visit the A.R.C. Sky headquarters. Parents, please pay attention to your children. Do not run around on the transporter.*

*\[Transporter activates\]*

**[Tour Guide Robot]**<br>
*Then, let us begin today's tour\~ Do we have any first\-time visitors here?*

**Kids**<br>
Me\~ Me\~

**[Tour Guide Robot]**<br>
*Very good. Everyone, please follow me closely afterward. Do not run off on your own, understand?*

**Kids**<br>
Okay\~

**[Tour Guide Robot]**<br>
*We have many students from the Academy here today as well. Later, you may have an opportunity to have a quick chat with our engineers. We believe it will bring great benefits to your career experience.*

**Students**<br>
... Umm, oh, okay.

**[Tour Guide Robot]**<br>
*Oh? We have an individual visitor too. Miss, are you prepared to have a technology trip in A.R.C.?*

**Ivy**<br>

**Employee A**<br>
Hey, have you heard about it? What happened to Hank last week.

**Employee B**<br>
Ah, he triggered the Library's security system. Then he got fired, just like that!

**Employee A**<br>
I heard that it was not on purpose. This is horrible, isn't it?

**Employee B**<br>
Yeah. If you take freight elevator No.5 and go down the central area, you can accidentally wander in there easily... All the hallways there look exactly the same.

**Employee A**<br>
We better be careful too.

**Ivy**<br>
Freight elevator No.5...

*[→Signal Switches]*

*\[Footsteps\]*

**Ivy**<br>
... Library! It's here...

*\[Alarm\]*

**Ivy**<br>

**[Drone]**<br>
*Warning. This area is a high\-level restricted area. Personnel who hasn't cleared identification is forbidden to enter. Please leave.*

**Ivy**<br>

*\[Alarm\]*

**[Broadcast]**<br>
*Level 2 alarm issued. Main structure isolation complete. Full area scan about to begin. Each squad, please conduct search using mode W\-2.*

**Ivy**<br>
Ugh...

*\[Hides\]*

**Security A**<br>
Report! Deployment for all squads, complete!

**Security Captain**<br>
Take a look at this. The drone has been smashed. We have ourselves a malicious trespasser! Have we gotten any information about the suspect?

**Security A**<br>
Umm... As of now, not yet.

**Security Captain**<br>
Hmph... No matter what, we cannot let anyone trespass into the host area in the upper levels! Do you hear me?

**Ivy**<br>
Upper levels...

*\[Alarm\]*

**[Broadcast]**<br>
*Warning, full area scan about to begin. Non\-official staff who has not yet cleared the bio\-identification process will be marked as an illegal trespasser.*

**Security Captain**<br>
Alrighty, time to work! If you see the trespasser, just shoot it! No need to hesitate!

**Securities**<br>
Aye aye, captain!

*[→Signal Switches]*

**Ivy**<br>
Library... the door is tightly locked. Nevertheless, judging by the structure of this wall... It can't be...

**Security Captain**<br>
Continue to search! The trespasser may still be nearby!

**Ivy**<br>
... Crap... All in all, got to record the coordinates first.<br>
This wiring... There should be another method for me to see what's inside.

*\[Hurried Footsteps\]*

*[Signal Lost]*
