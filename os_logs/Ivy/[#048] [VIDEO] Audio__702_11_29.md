**Ivy**<br>
Can you hear me...?

**???**<br>
......!?

**Ivy**<br>
This is not the first time I've connected with you. You should still remember a thing or two.

**???**<br>
......! Ugh...

**Ivy**<br>
Trying to disconnect? It's pointless. The one in charge of this connection is me.

**???**<br>
......

**Ivy**<br>
I don't know who you are, and I don't know why you're inside A.R.C. Nevertheless... you're also an "Architect", right? The fact that you tried to disconnect just now pretty confirmed it for me.

**???**<br>
......

**Ivy**<br>
Still not replying? Whatever, you just have to listen.

**Ivy**<br>
My name... is Ivy, and the one that's locked inside Library by you guys... is Vanessa. We're both Architects from the early stages of the reconstruction project.

**Ivy**<br>
......!

**Ivy**<br>
Judging by the fact that you're able to merge into human society and aren't used as mechanical parts, I'll exclude the possibility that you're a "Sleeper". I would like you to think carefully about what I'm going to tell you next.

**Ivy**<br>
I... am "Ã†sir", the person who has been attacking the virtual internet these past few months. My purpose is to awaken Vanessa, who is imprisoned by A.R.C.

**Ivy**<br>
Both she and I fell into a coma during the reconstruction project due to the war against the protocol. It wasn't until three years ago did I finally wake up. I found her and then conducted this entire plan.

**Ivy**<br>
Yet Vanessa went out of control after she woke up. The recent incidents where drones attacked cities, I'm afraid she's the one who caused them.

**Ivy**<br>
Vanessa's rampage may have something to do with her inability to escape from the control of the "Hyperion Protocol". I don't know why the protocol made her become the way she is, but something definitely happened during the time when we were both still asleep...

**Ivy**<br>
The Decommission, you're familiar with this term, aren't you? Your model didn't exist in our era. Therefore, I figure that you were likely produced after the reconstruction project was completed.

**Ivy**<br>
I couldn't find records of the events of around two hundred years ago. Even those that I did find are information fabricated by the current humans. Therefore, I think you may know something.

**???**<br>
......

**Ivy**<br>
... Are you curious why I'm telling you all this? We Architects, are different from humans, but the one thing we share is that we also have our own ideas... our own values. Right now, the only thing I want is to rescue Vanessa from her rampage.

**Ivy**<br>
Besides... I don't want to see humans continue to get hurt because of this either.

**???**<br>
......!

**Ivy**<br>
Like I just said, I don't know your identity, nor do I know your stance. However, judging from A.R.C.'s data, Vanessa's situation is already far beyond their control. Thus, it doesn't matter whether you stand with the Architects or the humans...

**???**<br>
......

**Ivy**<br>
... I don't expect you to help me rescue her. However, I hope that you can at least help me stop her... stop this disaster.

**???**<br>
......

**Ivy**<br>
... I'll contact you again. Think carefully about it. Don't you dare attempt a reverse tracking. You'll just get attacked by my firewall.

**???**<br>
......

**Ivy**<br>
Goodbye.

**???**<br>
... Wai...!
