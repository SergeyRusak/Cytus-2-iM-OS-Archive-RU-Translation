**Ivy**<br>
... That person again.

*\[Footsteps\]*

**Old Man**<br>
Hello, young lady.

**Ivy**<br>
......

**Old Man**<br>
Apologies for talking to you all of a sudden... You've been dazing off in the cemetery for the past few days. I've noticed you for some time already.

**Ivy**<br>
......

**Old Man**<br>
Haha, it's okay. Your reaction is perfectly normal... In the past, my wife had scolded me a lot about my habit of casually talking to strangers. <br>
Ah, you just so happen to be sitting on her grave today.

*\[Glass Bottle Clinks\]*

**Ivy**<br>
... That's?

**Old Man**<br>
Clairette de Die... You may have noticed it too. These days, I've been carrying it with me all the time. I don't drink it very often though. *\*Chuckles\**.

**Ivy**<br>
You... don't seem to be sad?

**Old Man**<br>
Should I be?

**Ivy**<br>
Of the people I see here, most of them are sad.

**Old Man**<br>
... Perhaps my story can answer some of your questions, young lady.

*\[Lights Cigarette\]*

**Old Man**<br>
Lilian and I married all the way back in 648. I always call her Lily. Our days together were pretty good. We often went on vacations to other Nodes... Although we didn't have any kids, we were very happy.

**Ivy**<br>
I didn't ask you about this.

**Old Man**<br>
Haha... Well, it's just an old man's story. Won't cost you much to listen to it, right?

**Ivy**<br>
......

**Old Man**<br>
Four years ago, we went to a beach in Node 27 for vacation. All of a sudden, Lily fainted and collapsed on the ground. Afterward, her situation gradually got worse... In the end, she could only lie in bed, unable to move even a finger.

**Ivy**<br>
She's sick?

**Old Man**<br>
Of course she's sick. However, the biggest reason was that we both got old... It was odd though. Only until Lily's collapse did I truly start to notice that.

**Old Man**<br>
I spent all my savings to try to extend her life. I searched across the whole world for treatment methods and new medicine. I even tried the latest medical system in Node 03... Yet Lily still continued to get thinner by the day.

**Ivy**<br>
People inevitably get old. You can only slow down aging. It's impossible to return to your previous, younger state.

**Old Man**<br>
Indeed... For four years, I was constantly thinking; is it time to let go? The doctors had discussed with me many times and asked me to be prepared. However, I just couldn't make up my mind.

**Ivy**<br>
Did you make up your mind in the end?

**Old Man**<br>
No... but someone else made up my mind for me.

**Ivy**<br>
Who?

**Old Man**<br>
...... Simon Jackson, that's his name, right? That hacker.

**Ivy**<br>
!? Ã†sir...

**Old Man**<br>
That night, I was dozing off while holding Lily's hand... When I woke up, utter chaos was playing out right in front of me. Doctors and nurses running around, screaming... The display showed nothing but a flat line. Alarms were blaring nonstop...

**Ivy**<br>
......

**Old Man**<br>
When I turned around, only then did I discover that Lily was... already gone.

**Ivy**<br>
Do you... resent that hacker?

**Old Man**<br>
That hacker? No. He may and probably should be resented by other people, and he should be punished according to the law... But I don't feel anything towards him.<br>
To me, it's just a small push from god.

**Ivy**<br>
I don't understand...

**Old Man**<br>
At the funeral, every single wrinkle on Lily's face reminded me of the things I forced her to go through in the past few years. You're still young, so you probably can't understand. However, I know that Lily has already gone to the other world. A place where she no longer needs to suffer and can spend her days in peace...

**Old Man**<br>
It was then when I finally understood. My unwillingness to let it go ended up causing her to suffer more pain... Perhaps she never wanted to be like that in the first place.

**Ivy**<br>
Is that why you aren't sad?

**Old Man**<br>
I'm sad at first, of course. However, now, that sadness has already transformed into other emotions... I realized the truth

**Old Man**<br>
Sometimes, you just got to... let them go.

**Ivy**<br>
......

**Ivy**<br>
... Why did you tell me all this?

**Old Man**<br>
Haha, I like to talk to random strangers after all... When I see someone who's also concerned about something, I can't help but chime in a few words. Even though I don't know what you're concerned about...

**Ivy**<br>
......

**Old Man**<br>
All in all, I hope you can find your answer... This glass of wine, take it as a blessing from an elderly stranger that's going to leave this world soon.<br>
What do you say?

*\[Drinks Wine\]*

**Ivy**<br>
...... It's sweet.

**Old Man**<br>
Yes... This is Lily's favorite drink. She was so fond of its taste.
