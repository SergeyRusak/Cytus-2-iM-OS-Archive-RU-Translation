*Come, look over here! Delicious ice cream! Ho? Little boy, your name is Sam, right? This ice cream is free! Here's one for you!*

**Pedestrian S**<br>
Wow! Thank you!

**[Ice Cream Machine]**<br>
*You're welcome! Happy 700th Anniversary~ Hahaha!*

**Pedestrian S**<br>
Mama, look!

**Pedestrian M**<br>
I saw it. Good for you.

**Pedestrian F**<br>
You two, stay close to me. We need to get to the venue as soon as possible! PAFF's performance is starting soon~

**Pedestrian M**<br>
Alright~ baby, hold on to mama's hand.

**Pedestrian N**<br>
I heard that everything in the Game Center is also free today! So, whaddaya think? Let's go there now!

**Pedestrian A**<br>
Ah~ But I really want to watch the free PAFF performance as well~~

**Pedestrian N**<br>
Don't be stupid. That place is already STUFFED full of people. We should go to the relatively unpopular locations first! That way, we won't get stuck in the crowd for hours!

**Pedestrian A**<br>
Dude, "unpopular" locations don't exist this year. I expect no less from the 700th Anniversary, the admins really put down the money for this event! Every single celebration event and products in the shops are all free~

**Pedestrian N**<br>
I am so blessed to be born in this era! This year is absolutely the grandest Node carnival I have and will ever experience in my life!

**Pedestrian B**<br>
Hey! You guys! Join the cyTus lobby now! PAFF's performance just made an announcement that they will be releasing additional seats for the virtual space! Get in there and grab one now!

**Pedestrian N**<br>
You serious!? Arrgghh... My chip speed is not fast enough. No way in hell will I get a seat...

**Pedestrian A**<br>
There's a virtual internet storefront right ahead. It's also sponsored by the celebration. They are now doing free chip upgrades! Start running!

**Pedestrian N**<br>
Holy...! I'm so touched I'm gonna cry...... 700th Anniversary is f\*\*\*\*\* awesome!!
