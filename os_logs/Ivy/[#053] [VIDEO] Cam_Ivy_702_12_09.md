URGHHWHAHHHHH!!!

**Noah**<br>
Hang in there! The core is having a reaction!<br>
Focus!

**Ivy**<br>
...... Va...... nessa...... aaahhhhH!!!!!

*[»»»Fast Forward»»»]*

**Ivy**<br>
... ughh...

**Noah**<br>
You awake?

**Ivy**<br>
... How'd it go!?

**Noah**<br>
Relax. We succeeded... The signal accuracy rate reached 99.97 %. Haha, my theory is correct!

**Ivy**<br>
Vanessa... how's she doing?

**Noah**<br>
Her name's Vanessa...?

**Ivy**<br>
... Yeah.

**Noah**<br>
The full memory transfer is complete. Right now, it's being inputted into the empty unit you brought here. After that, all we need to do is awaken her.<br>
This is simply incredible... my main processor has never calculated such massive amounts of data before, and yet it managed to somehow process the data.

**Ivy**<br>
……<br>
Sorry, your mission's not yet complete. After she wakes up, I'm going to delete the memories you have that are related to us.

**Noah**<br>
... I guessed as much.

**Ivy**<br>
… Is that so? Doesn't look like you care.

**Noah**<br>
However, I have a tiny request. Let me preserve the delight that came from this successful experiment. You allowed me to complete the final step of my research, to prove that I was correct all along... That's all I ask for. Can you? Æsir?

**Ivy**<br>
……

**Noah**<br>
You never told me your name. However, from your actions and abilities, I assumed it was you.

**Ivy**<br>
For a human, you're very smart. I agree to your request. Take it as a sign of respect from me.

**Noah**<br>
... I'm nothing more than a criminal scientist. Even this technology, while it is my pride and joy, a part of me also feels nothing but disgust and pain... It's the source of my nightmares... For these past years, it has been every night...

**Noah**<br>
My wife stopped me several times. I also thought of ending it all and facing my sins calmly... but once I thought of how close the theory was to being successful, I could never put it down. I always wanted to take that very last step...

**Ivy**<br>
……

**Noah**<br>
You've investigated me. You must know what I'm talking about... Compared to your memory with Vanessa, I'm just some fool that deserves to be treated with disdain, hahaha...

**Ivy**<br>
... I've learned a few things after being in contact with human society these past years.

**Noah**<br>
……?

**Ivy**<br>
There are many different kinds of humans...The amount of diversity in just a single individual... We're, in fact, no better than you. You humans will do lots of things that have no logical meaning or principle behind them, based on a variety of motives. Regardless of who it is, they can't be summed up easily. I think... that's what you refer to as "emotions"?

**Noah**<br>
We both did many things we can't forgive ourselves for, all for the people we treasure... Perhaps we're indeed not that different.

*\[Typing on keyboard\]*

**Noah**<br>
It's time. The conditions for awakening have been met; sorry, this is going to hurt a bit for both of you. Are you prepared?

*\[Holds Hand\]*

**Ivy**<br>
Vanessa… hang in there. It'll all be over soon.

*\[Electrical Shock\]*

**???????**<br>
... urghhaaaaaahhhh!!!!

**Ivy**<br>
... raaaaaahhhhhh!!

**Noah**<br>

It's me. I'm here, Vanessa! Can you hear me?

**???????**<br>

**Ivy**<br>
Vanessa......<br>
Urgh...!?

**Noah**<br>
What is going on...!?

**Ivy**<br>
Wake up... Vanessa! It's... me!<br>
Noah! What's... happening...?

**Noah**<br>
No, I don't know! Her actions and consciousness are not linked...? Why is this happening!?

**???????**<br>
……

*\[Objects Crashing\]*

**Noah**<br>
Ay… AY!? Wait...

**???????**<br>
……

*\[Bang\]*

**Noah**<br>
OOF!!... Bla... BLAARGH...!

**Ivy**<br>
STOP!!

*\[Unit Shatters\]*

**Ivy**<br>
Huff, puff... did it not work? Noah, what on earth...?

**Noah**<br>
……

**Ivy**<br>
Noah? Oh... this injury is serious...

**Ivy**<br>
DAMNIT! There's only one of these...
