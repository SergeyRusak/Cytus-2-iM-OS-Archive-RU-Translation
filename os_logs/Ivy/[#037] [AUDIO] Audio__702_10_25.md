**Ivy**<br>
......

**Vanessa**<br>
Ivy...? What... happened to me? What is this place?

**Ivy**<br>
... You were captured by humans. Right now, I am talking to you through the virtual internet set up by humans... Don't be scared! I will save you right away.

**Vanessa**<br>
Humans... Right, I...

**Ivy**<br>
Do you recall anything? From the time you were in a coma.

**Vanessa**<br>
Just a little bit. Although my consciousness is blurry and my body couldn't move, I can still faintly sense what's happening outside...

**Ivy**<br>
I'm so glad that I was able to awaken you. It took me so much effort...

**Vanessa**<br>
I... Where am I now? How did you find me? How much time has passed?

**Ivy**<br>
No need to hurry. I will slowly tell you everything I know.

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

**Vanessa**<br>
I see... So 553 years have passed.

**Ivy**<br>
Yes. Now, I have to figure out a way to get you out of there, but things aren't as simple as I thought... Humans have already taken control of the entire city. A.R.C. and your physical unit play a very important role in human society. Your body is also not in the condition to casually leave the Shelter ruins...

**Vanessa**<br>
... Ccccan you figure out a way to capture more memory samples than what you used to wake me up?

**Ivy**<br>
Eh...? I'm afraid that it will be rather difficult. In order to achieve what I'm doing now, I've already resorted to some pretty extreme methods. The memories I captured is quite a considerable amount already. Even with so many memory samples, I still experienced multiple failed tries before I was finally able to awaken you.

**Vanessa**<br>
... You were using a small\-scale Cytus mainframe you made yourself. If it's the original model ininin Shelter, IIII'll be able to perform a troubleshoot. My body will be able to move as well.

**Ivy**<br>
...? I would still have to figure out other methods... I don't really want to harm humans anymore.

**Vanessa**<br>
... Wwwwwhat do you mean?

**Ivy**<br>
I've been living in human society for the past two years. I was able to observe many things. They are a lot more complicated than what we deemed them to be... Perhaps, the difference between us is not as significant as we previously thought...

**Vanessa**<br>
... No... allllll.... kill...them all...

**Ivy**<br>
Vanessa...?

**Vanessa**<br>
......<br>
I see... So 553 years have passed.

**Ivy**<br>
Vanessa? What did you just say...?

**Vanessa**<br>
Eh? Did I just say something...?

**Ivy**<br>
No... nothing. Your system still doesn't seem very stable. It's best that you don't think about complicated things for now.

**Vanessa**<br>
Okay... When I was asleep, my consciousness seemed to sink into a space that's so deep and so dark... There, I saw so many terrible things humans have done. It's just like the files Ilka showed us! Every time I see those images, I find it more and more difficult to keep my emotions in control...

**Ivy**<br>
You need to endure it and try to relax as much as possible. Right now, many of A.R.C.'s technology and the virtual internet humans use rely mainly on the Library you're in to process information. The system errors that occurred right before your awakening ended up crippling cyTus for a pretty long time. That caused a pretty major commotion in human society. If that situation repeats multiple times, I can't imagine what they will do to you...

**Vanessa**<br>
Okay... I will try my best to stay stable. I'm really, really happy to see you again. I feel much more at ease now...

**Ivy**<br>
Me too... I've got to disconnect now. This connection is not meant for long connection times, as there are some pretty skilled people in A.R.C. I will maintain contact with you routinely through this connection. Wait for me, Vanessa.

**Vanessa**<br>
Yes, I'll be waiting for you.
