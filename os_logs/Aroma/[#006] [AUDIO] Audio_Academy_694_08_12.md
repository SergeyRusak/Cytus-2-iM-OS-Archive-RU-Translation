The heck... Where did she go?<br>
Ah, Thomas; have you seen Aroma? I need to give her the lecture materials from last semester. 

**Classmate A**<br>
Hmm, I don't think I have.<br>
I think she stayed in the music classroom after our previous music lesson ended. Maybe you can take a look there?

**Clara**<br>
Got it. Thanks!

**Clara**<br>
Aroma...

**Aroma**<br>
Woah! You scared me...

**Clara**<br>
Ah, sorry\~ But your singing is amazing... It's been a while since I last heard you sing.

**Aroma**<br>
Thank you.

**Clara**<br>
Here, these are for you. Some extra materials from last semester as well as the visual aids for the lectures.

**Aroma**<br>
Thank you.

**Clara**<br>
Ah, but I guess you probably don't need them... You were supposed to be behind by almost a year, yet after you came back, your grades caught up with Daniel and me in like an instant.

**Aroma**<br>
That's not a big deal...

**Clara**<br>
By the way, what song was that?

**Aroma**<br>
... I don't know myself either. I just got this nostalgic feeling, and the words just sort of came out by themselves...

**Clara**<br>
Hoho, so you still remember quite a few things. Then I'm sure that your memory will also recover in no time as well!

**Aroma**<br>
Yes...

**Clara**<br>
On a side note... I didn't know that Aroma knows how to play the piano?

**Aroma**<br>
...... Eh? I, I don't know...

**Clara**<br>
I've never heard you play it before. That's awesome!

**Aroma**<br>
... Thank you.

**Clara**<br>
Aw, come on... Don't put on a long face all the time. I was serious when I said you were awesome. Your grades are good; your singing voice is beautiful; you are talented in other things too... Most importantly, you look so adorable and you have this flawless\~ skin\~ Seriously, did you type in some cheat code for life? You have to remember what an amazing person you are\~ Take this take this\~

**Aroma**<br>
Ahahah... Stop it, that tickles...<br>
Thank you... But...

**Clara**<br>
Hmm? What's the matter?

**Aroma**<br>
I don't know... I just feel like the people in class don't really like me... <br>
Before my accident... did something happen?

**Clara**<br>
Ah\~ That's... I say you should just ignore those people! I'm 99.99% sure that they are just jealous of you because you are simply too perfect! No need to worry!

**Aroma**<br>
I see...

**Clara**<br>
Let's go! Iris is waiting for us. We should eat lunch together!

**Aroma**<br>
Sure.
