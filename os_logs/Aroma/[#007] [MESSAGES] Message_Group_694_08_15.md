Have you guys heard about this? Harry from class 2 confessed to Miss A again today<br>
*[Sent at PM 21:57]*

**Anonymous Banana**<br>
Again? Didn't he get turned down before<br>
*[Sent at PM 21:57]*

**Anonymous Apple**<br>
Well, he felt that since she forgot about everything, maybe he has another chance<br>

**Anonymous Grape**<br>
Can't believe that there are still people who think that memory loss thing is true<br>
*[Sent at PM 21:57]*

**Anonymous Watermelon**<br>
Yeah, suffers memory loss yet still gets top scores in every subject, Bull f.... s... She got a full score on her continuation exam too. Isn't that absurd<br>

**Anonymous Pear**<br>
Told you that this is setting up for her idol career. Artists with some kind of \*tragicbackstory\* like this will bring it up whenever they are losing popularity<br>
*[Sent at PM 21:58]*

**Anonymous Apple**<br>
Agreed. People don't care about the truth anyway. Good looks get you everything<br>

**Anonymous Banana**<br>
? Who's this<br>
*[Sent at PM 21:59]*

**Anonymous Pear**<br>
Doesn't this message group only has people from our class?<br>
*[Sent at PM 21:59]*

**Anonymous Watermelon**<br>
Nope. There are plenty of people who hate Miss A in other classes<br>
*[Sent at PM 21:59]*

**Anonymous Grape**<br>
We're anonymous anyway. Doesn't matter who it is<br>

I saw her playing the piano in the music classroom a few days ago.<br>
*[Sent at PM 22:00]*

**Anonymous Watermelon**<br>
Wow, that's quite the news you have for your first message<br>
*[Sent at PM 22:00]*

**Anonymous Apple**<br>
U serious? Not only does she cheat in tests but she plays the piano too? What is this witchcraft<br>
*[Sent at PM 22:00]*

**Anonymous Banana**<br>
Did she really lose her memory? LOL<br>
*[Sent at PM 22:01]*

**Anonymous Grape**<br>
Doesn't remember any names yet still remembers how to play the piano<br>
*[Sent at PM 22:01]*

**Anonymous Watermelon**<br>
My guess is that those three plates on her head are also just for show<br>
*[Sent at PM 22:01]*

**Anonymous Pear**<br>
Maybe she thinks it's \*fashionable\* LMFAO<br>
*[Sent at PM 22:01]*

**[Aroma]**<br>
She did file an application to the system. If not for that, it's against the rules to wear any accessory besides the uniform.<br>
*[Sent at PM 22:01]*

**Anonymous Banana**<br>
Let's take it off and see what happens<br>
*[Sent at PM 22:01]*

**Anonymous Pear**<br>
Anyone wants to join??<br>
*[Sent at PM 22:02]*

**Anonymous Grape**<br>
Why not<br>
*[Sent at PM 22:02]*

**[Aroma]**<br>
Quick advise; don't do anything too serious. A while ago, someone got deducted 20 points by the system when they pushed her to the ground.<br>
*[Sent at PM 22:02]*

**Anonymous Watermelon**<br>
It wasn't even that hard of a push<br>
*[Sent at PM 22:02]*

**Anonymous Apple**<br>
Miss A is an idol ya know, she's precious<br>
