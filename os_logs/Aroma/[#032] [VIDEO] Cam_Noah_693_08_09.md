**[Iris]**<br>
*The continuation exam is right around the corner. I'm so nervous...*

**Aroma**<br>
You don't have to be nervous. According to a senior, the continuation exam from I to J is not actually that difficult.

**[Iris]**<br>
*It's easy for you to say that, since you, Clara and Daniel are the Big 3. You guys are going to crush this exam with ease... <br>
If I don't stay in the same grade range as you guys, I'm getting demoted to class 2 the next semester...*

**Aroma**<br>
You worry too much\~ Iris will be fine too. We studied late every day just for this, didn't we?

**[Iris]**<br>
*Yes...*

**Aroma**<br>
Just approach it normally. With your current grades, you can mess up 1 or 2 questions and still end up in class 1. All you need to do is perform up to your usual standards. If you're too nervous, you won't remember what you studied.<br>
Relax\~ We are all going to J\-1, together. 

**[Iris]**<br>
*Got it! Hearing you say that really calms my mind down... Though I hope you can encourage yourself like that on stage too. Every time I see you on\-stage, I always get sweaty palms because you're literally shaking. Haha.*

**Aroma**<br>
Don't tease me like that\~ That's mean!

**[Iris]**<br>
*Aroma is about to become a celebrity... feels like you're going to another world. I'm happy for you, but I also feel a bit... lonely. When you become famous, will we still be friends?*

**Aroma**<br>
You're overexaggerating... I promise you, that no matter what happens, we will always be best friends. Forever.

**[Iris]**<br>
*Uh\-huh! Deal!<br>
On a side note, it's getting pretty late. Is it ok for you to stay up till now?*

**Aroma**<br>
Sister is not coming home tonight, so I can stay up a bit later. However, it's about time I go to sleep too.

**[Iris]**<br>
*Yep, same for me. See you tomorrow at school then! Goodnight,*

**Aroma**<br>
Goodnight\~

*[Call ends]*

**Aroma**<br>
Yawns\~ Tuner\-san, set the alarm clock. I'm going to bed.

**[Tuner-san]**<br>
*Alarm clock set. Goodnight, Aroma\~ Goodnight\~*

*\[Crashing noises\]*

**Aroma**<br>
！？<br>
What is that noise...?

**Noah**<br>
...... Damnit!! Those pieces of s\*\*\*!

**Aroma**<br>
Noah...?

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Aroma**<br>
Noah? Are you alright?

**Noah**<br>
Ah... Aroma... I just got home...<br>
Did I disturb your sleep...?

**Aroma**<br>
No, I was just about to sleep... Are you okay? You look terrible...

**Noah**<br>
Those old bastards! Hoarding all the resources yet don't have the knowledge to do anything! what can't they just all die!?

**Aroma**<br>
...... Noah!?

**Noah**<br>
They understand nothing! The importance of this technique! This will offer a brand\-new interpretation to existing technology!! Such a major breakthrough! Could anybody else achieve these results!?

**[Tuner-san]**<br>
*Noah blood alcohol level too high, recommend proper rest.*

**Noah**<br>
Shut up...

*\[Tuner-san OFF\]*

**Aroma**<br>
......?

**Noah**<br>
Aroma... you understand, right? All the hard work I did...

**Aroma**<br>
I understand. It's all for sister...

**Noah**<br>
No...... Ugh!

![aos3201.png](./attachments/aos3201.png)
**Aroma**<br>
Woah! Be careful. Maybe you should sit down first?

**Noah**<br>
Everything I did... It's all for you...

**Aroma**<br>
Eh?

**Noah**<br>
IT'S ALL FOR YOU! YOU STILL CAN'T SEE THAT!?

**Aroma**<br>
Ummm... Noah? What are you talking... EEK!

**Noah**<br>
......

**Aroma**<br>
What are you doing!? You're drunk! Please calm down!

**Noah**<br>
You should've realized for a while now, right? Compare to Helena... I rather... you...

**Aroma**<br>
No...... AHHHHHH!!
