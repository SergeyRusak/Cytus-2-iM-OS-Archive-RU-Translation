**Helena**<br>
Then that's it for today's meeting. We would like you to address the aforementioned notes. Thank you.

**[Event Organizer]**<br>
*Got it. We are all very excited about PAFF's amazing performance. Bye bye~*

**Helena**<br>
Whew, finally done with that. Aroma, you must be hungry, right?

**Aroma**<br>
Yes, a little...

**Helena**<br>
Then let's go grab lunch.

**Chris**<br>
Ah, do you two have a minute?

**Helena**<br>
Just finished our meeting with SkyEkho and on our way to lunch. What's the matter?

**Chris**<br>
I discovered a very interesting rookie composer. She sent me a lot of her demos. I feel like if PAFF collaborated with her, the results will certainly be great!

**Helena**<br>
PAFF already has two to three arrangers that she works with regularly though?

**Chris**<br>
Ahhh, no, this one is VERY different. First of all, she is super cute. Like, she's a level of cute where she can make a debut right now. Check out her photo.

**Helena**<br>
Asakura Neko? What a weird name.<br>
Hmm... She is definitely cute. However, still no match for our PAFF, right?

**Aroma**<br>
Eh? Ummm...

**Chris**<br>
More importantly, her avant\-garde music! If you pair that with PAFF's singing, they are absolutely going to be the next big thing! These two together will create magnificent sparks of genius never seen before! <br>
Can you at least listen to her demo? 

**Helena**<br>
We are on our way to lunch. We'll talk about it after we get back.

**Aroma**<br>
Umm... I want to hear it.

**Helena**<br>
Eh? Didn't you say you were hungry?

**Aroma**<br>
... I'm a little curious, about her work...

**Helena**<br>
... Alright.

*\[Music\]*

**Chris**<br>
How was it? Amazing, isn't it?

**Helena**<br>
Hmm... I don't really understand this type of music... Aroma, what do you think?

**Aroma**<br>
I... quite like it. I kind of want to give it a try.

**Chris**<br>
Woah! See, even the usually uninterested PAFF is saying she wants to give it a try!

**Aroma**<br>
Eh? Was I like that...?

**Helena**<br>
Hmmm... PAFF's work for the past 2~3 years are all covers and arrangements. Putting out a "singer\-songwriter" tag at this time will certainly help her increase her audience reach too.

**Chris**<br>
Right? PAFF, you want to try writing a song on your own, don't you?

**Aroma**<br>
Yes. I can play a little bit of piano, but I've never tried composing.

**Helena**<br>
......

**Chris**<br>
Great! Then I guess a decision is made. Let's try it with one song. If the results are promising, then we can consider making this a long\-term relationship!

**Helena**<br>
If we are talking about a collab effort, constant communication is a must, right? Aroma, are you ok with that?

**Aroma**<br>
Yes... If it's a girl then I should be... Also, I feel like I can be friends with this person.

**Chris**<br>
After PAFF made her debut, she seems to lack interaction with peers and friends. Letting her know a few more people will only benefit her.

**Helena**<br>
... Regardless, I still don't want to put too much stress on her. <br>
Aroma, leave most of the things to sis. I'll deal with them for you.

**Aroma**<br>
Understood.
