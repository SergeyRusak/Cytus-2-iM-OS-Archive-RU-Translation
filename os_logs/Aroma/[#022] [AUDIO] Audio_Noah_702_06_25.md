Thank you, everyone. ^^

*\[Logout\]*

**Aroma**<br>
Whew...

**Helena**<br>
Good work, Aroma. You did very well! The fans are all very happy.

**Aroma**<br>
Happy...?

**Helena**<br>
For sure. Even after you went offline, the discussion is still going on strong.<br>
The usually mysterious idol suddenly appears to chat with everybody; of course it's going to cause a ruckus.

**Aroma**<br>
I... I don't think I am very good at chatting with others...

**Helena**<br>
But that doesn't stop the fans from liking you; they like you for who you are. The 7th Anniversary is a big day. Mono is practically devoting the entire company's resources to this concert. You have to work harder.<br>
Here, have some tea.

**Aroma**<br>
Thank you.

*\[Drinks tea\]*

**Helena**<br>
Chris also mentioned just now. The company is pretty satisfied with the results of the chatting strategy. He will set up a schedule for this. We will promote this fan chatting event based on the dates on that schedule.

**Aroma**<br>
... How often do I need to do this?

**Helena**<br>
Let me think... If the frequency is too high, you lose that feeling of freshness...<br>
It should be around once every week to two weeks. However, we want to randomize the dates so the fans won't find out that this is all a marketing strategy.

**Aroma**<br>
... Is that so...

**[Tuner-san]**<br>
*Aroma is feeling down. Aroma is feeling down...*

*\[Drinks tea\]*

**Helena**<br>
Haha, that's something you don't see every day. Aroma, you don't seem to dislike interacting with fans on iM?

**Aroma**<br>
Yes... If it's just with an avatar and typing...<br>
Even though the number of messages is a bit overwhelming, it's still a lot of fun.

**Helena**<br>
Everyone is eager to talk with their beloved PAFF after all.<br>
I'll get Chris to find someone to install a filter program. That way, Aroma won't receive those nonsensical questions anymore.

**Aroma**<br>
Understood. Thank you.

**Helena**<br>
... Nonetheless, "The Mysterious Diva" PAFF, who doesn't speak a word on\-stage and only focuses on singing, is now wanting to be closer to her fans... I bet this kind of rumor is already spreading online.

**Aroma**<br>
......

**Helena**<br>
No need to worry. It's a great thing that you want to be closer to everyone else.<br>
I'll try and arrange more dates for you to have a good chat with your fans.

**Aroma**<br>
Yes. During concerts... I'll try my best to talk a bit more as well.

**Helena**<br>
Don't force yourself! If you're too conscious about trying to speak, you'll lose focus. We don't want it to affect your singing.

**Aroma**<br>
I know. It's just that...

**Helena**<br>
Hmm?

**Aroma**<br>
I've never interacted with so many people before. Yet for some reason, I get this... nostalgic feeling...

**Helena**<br>
......

**Aroma**<br>
Sister?

**Helena**<br>
... Nothing. I may be getting a little exhausted.<br>
I'll go wash my face. Aroma, take a rest.

**Aroma**<br>
... OK.
