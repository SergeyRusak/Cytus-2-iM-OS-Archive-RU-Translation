**Helena**<br>
Good work. You can take a quick break now. Here, have some water.

**Aroma**<br>
Thank you. The new song is a bit hard to sing correctly... This is a song I made together with NEKO. I have to work harder...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
What is the meaning of all this!?

**Chris**<br>
Now, now~ You should calm down a bit first...

**Aroma**<br>
There seems to be an argument outside the recording studio...? Is everything fine?

**Helena**<br>
It probably has nothing to do with us.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Then find someone to explain this BS to me clearly!

**Aroma**<br>
... Is that NEKO's voice?

**Helena**<br>
I think I'll go take a look. You should finish practicing the remaining parts.

*[Signal Switches]*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
I've had it with you people! Do you have any idea how many times this has happened!?

**Helena**<br>
NEKO? What's going on?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Ah, sis Helena! So this means that PAFF is in there too, right? Does she know anything about this?

**Helena**<br>
What are you talking about? Get a hold of yourself first. Sit down and tell me what happened.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Look at this! This is the packaging for PAFF's next album. NEKO's name is nowhere to be seen! NEKO composed more than 80% of the songs in it!

**Helena**<br>
Eh? Didn't you two work on this album together?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
That's not the point. The main point is that NEKO's name straight up doesn't exist on the packaging! PAFF is even credited as the arranger! What the heck is this nonsense!?

**Helena**<br>
I'm not the one in charge of the album's copy... I'll help you understand the situation, is that ok with you?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Forget about it! I know sis Helena may have nothing to do with this. B\-U\-T! Chris! You knew about this, didn't you! This is not the first time this has happened! <br>
Previously, you guys took NEKO's arrangements without permission and used it for some random crap. This is not what the contract says!

**Chris**<br>
It's not like I can change anything. These are all decisions made by the higher\-ups... If we're talking the law, the copyright of any work produced using the company's equipment does belong to the company, regardless of the creator...<br>
Didn't I also remind you about the PR image issues caused by your actions online? The company has been hesitant about promoting you because of that. They're tough on me too... <br>


**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
... This and that are two completely different issues!? Regardless of my actions, NEKO still made those songs! How could you guys do that!?<br>
ARGHHH! I had enough with this garbage contract!

*\[Rips contract\]*

**Chris**<br>
HEY! What are you...

**Helena**<br>
......

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
NEKO will no longer do anything for a s\*\*\*hole company like yours! I will never be your ghost producer ever again! I look like a fool!<br>
I've already paid for the liquidated damages, so that's it! Goodbye!

*\[Slams door\]*

**Chris**<br>
... Oh dear lord...

**Aroma**<br>
Umm... It seems that the argument got pretty serious, so I came out to see what's going on...

**Chris**<br>
NEKO left after tearing up her contract... What are we going to do now?

**Aroma**<br>
Eh...?<br>
Is she ok....? I think I heard my name back then...

**Helena**<br>
Aroma, you don't have to know anything. It'll be alright. <br>
No need to worry. If anything happens, sister will handle it.

**Aroma**<br>
... Got it...
