**Medical Staff A**<br>
Are you awake? Director!

**[Noah]**<br>
*Aroma.*

**Aroma**<br>
Noah... Ugh... What happened to me?

**[Noah]**<br>
*You fainted on stage... Rest assured, the checkup results showed nothing more than mere exhaustion. You'll be fine after some rest and nutrients. Your schedule for the past few days may have taken a serious toll on your body.*

**Aroma**<br>
Where's sister...?

**[Noah]**<br>
*Resting in the room next door. Because of you, she barely had any rest for the past few days too.*

**Aroma**<br>
*\*Sobs\**... *\*Sobs\**...

**[Noah]**<br>
*What's wrong...?*

**Aroma**<br>
I'm so happy... that I still remember you guys. I was so afraid that I'll forget everything again when I wake up... *\*Sobs\**...

**[Noah]**<br>
*... Rest assured. The scan results showed everything to be normal. Starting today, you siblings should both take some time off. You guys are working too much.<br>
As with the company's events, I'll find a way to let Chris handle them.*

**Aroma**<br>
I'm sorry... I made you guys worried again. I even caused everyone so much trouble...

**[Noah]**<br>
*No need to apologize. Nobody will blame you for what happened... In fact, I should be the one apologizing to you. As your attending physician, I failed to take good care of your physical conditions...<br>
Don't overthink yourself. You need to rest. I'll apply some medication to make you feel more relaxed. Enjoy your sleep.*

**Aroma**<br>
OK...
