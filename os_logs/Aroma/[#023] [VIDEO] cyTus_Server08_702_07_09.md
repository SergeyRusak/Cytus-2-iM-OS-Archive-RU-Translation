Chris, are you ready on your side?

**[Chris]**<br>
*Armed and ready. The monitoring program has finished setting. This is the latest version developed by A.R.C. It can monitor and manage all information on its own, as well as filter any keyword we desire. Not even a spec of dust can escape its almighty eye~*

**Helena**<br>
Jesus, how old are you... Are you certain that this program works?

**[Chris]**<br>
*Come on, sis Helena; You can at least trust me "sometimes"~<br>
This program is originally only available to major businesses for Beta testing. It cost the company a fortune to get our hands on this...*

**Helena**<br>
All in all, you make sure that harassment messages stay away from PAFF's feed. That's the least you can do.

**[Chris]**<br>
*No problemo~ Do you have any idea how much I crap I had to take in order to get this program... Of course I'm gonna use it to its maximum effect!*

**Helena**<br>
This 7th Anniversary event is the key to let Mono's name be known across the world. Those were their exact words. <br>
Go back and tell them, "Believe PAFF".

**[Chris]**<br>
*Ok, ok, I get it~ In short, I'm all set here.*

**Helena**<br>
Very well. We'll move this conversation to iM. If anything happens, PM me.<br>
Aroma, you can start.

**Aroma**<br>
OK.

**Chris**<br>
PAFF is starting to use emoticons now

**Helena**<br>
Yes, her interaction with fans is also getting more cheerful.<br>
Aroma, how is it? Are you enjoying this?

**PAFF-Official**<br>
Yes... Many people are talking about sister as well. Sister, do you want to join?

**Helena**<br>
No need for that.<br>
You're the star of the show tonight.

**Helena**<br>
Chris, any updates on the situation?

**Chris**<br>
This program really is brilliant. Harassment messages like those asking for her three sizes are all blocked. As of now, it has blocked more than 100 spam messages. Most importantly, the audience will not know that they are filtered

**Helena**<br>
Great. Try and shift the topic towards the concert. We want to leave a strong impression among fans.

**Chris**<br>
OK. Just took a quick peek<br>
They are indeed discussing the concert now

*\[Stabilizer warning\]*

**Helena**<br>
...... Eh?

**Chris**<br>
What's wrong

**Helena**<br>
Wait a second... It's a warning from Aroma's stabilizer. What is going on...?

**Chris**<br>
Is she alright? Is she feeling uncomfortable?

**Helena**<br>
Aroma, are you alright?

**PAFF-Official**<br>
Eh? I feel a bit dizzy... But I think I can handle it.

**Helena**<br>
Don't force yourself. Get offline and rest first. You can chat with your fans next time.

**PAFF-Official**<br>
But everyone is having a lot of fun right now...

**Helena**<br>
Negative. Logout now. Your stabilizer has been sending out warnings nonstop.

**PAFF-Official**<br>
OK... I'll say goodbye to everyone.

*[Signal Switches]*

**Aroma**<br>
Everyone feels a bit disappointed...

**Helena**<br>
That's fine. Your health is more important. How are you feeling right now?

**Aroma**<br>
Hmm... It seems that I do indeed have a slight headache...

**Helena**<br>
How is that happening...<br>
Did something occur during the chat?

**Aroma**<br>
The fans asked me something about the past... I tried to remember it, but I can't no matter how hard I try. The more I think about it, the more I... Ugh...

**Helena**<br>
That's enough. Stop talking. Quick, lie down and rest. Any other places you're not feeling comfortable?

**Aroma**<br>
Sister... I'm so scared... I can't remember anything before the memory loss... Now, even the things that happened recently are starting to get blurry...

**Helena**<br>
......

**Aroma**<br>
... I don't want to forget the sister I know now... *\*Sobs\**...

**Helena**<br>
Aroma...<br>
I, it's ok. No need to be scared. I'll contact Noah ASAP. He'll think of a way to help you...
