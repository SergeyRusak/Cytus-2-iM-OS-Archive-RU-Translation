**Aroma**<br>
Hmm... ugh...

**Helena**<br>
What's wrong? Is it too difficult? Maybe you should take a break?

**Aroma**<br>
I'm fine... Let me finish this set...

**Helena**<br>
You've been in bed for nine months. It's natural that your muscles feel weak... Fortunately, you can recover from that with just rehabilitation.

**Aroma**<br>
Yes... Whew... Done...

**Helena**<br>
Here, have a drink.

**Aroma**<br>
Thank you...

**Helena**<br>
Do you remember this? It's the triple juice. This used to be your favorite beverage.

**Aroma**<br>
......

**Helena**<br>
You don't remember...? It's okay. The fact that you were able to wake up from your coma is already more than I could ask for...<br>
Ah, right! Here, your Tuner\-san.

*\[Tuner-san ON\]*

**Aroma**<br>
My...?

**[Tuner-san]**<br>
*Aroma, Good morning\~ Good morning\~*

**Helena**<br>
It's an electronic pet that has been with you since you were little. It contains so many past photos and videos of us. Let's take a look. Maybe it'll help you recover your memory.<br>
Tuner\-san, play Album 6860420

**[Tuner-san]**<br>
*Album 6860420, projection start.*

*\[Song（Night Keepers - Bring the light）\]*

**[Aroma]**<br>
*\*Every time we hide  <br>
Into shadow that can make us feel love <br>
Eat the sorrow drink a cup of fear\**

**[Aroma]**<br>
*Sister! Happy birthday!*

**Aroma**<br>
This is...?

**Helena**<br>
You were celebrating my birthday with me. Remember? Aroma's singing really is beautiful...

**Aroma**<br>
... I don't remember anything... but this song sounds very familiar.

**[Aroma]**<br>
*Hahaha! Sis, you look so funny!*

**[Helena]**<br>
*How dare you throw a cake at me! You little... No running! I'll get you too! Hahaha!*

**Aroma**<br>
*\*Chuckles\**... It looks like so much fun.

**Helena**<br>
You were one heck of a mischievous brat; who knew you would become so shy after you grow up. <br>
So, how was it? Did anything ring a bell?

**Aroma**<br>
... No... I'm sorry.

**Helena**<br>
......

**Aroma**<br>
Ah... B, But if the things I forgot are all happy memories like that one, I really hope I can remember them soon... sister.

**Helena**<br>
...... Aroma...... *\*Sobs\**...

**Aroma**<br>
......

**Helena**<br>
Ah... no good, no good. How can I act so depressed like that? You're right; we need to help you recover your memory soon. <br>
Your body is recovering quite well physically. I can apply to the Academy for you to resume your studies. You have a lot of good friends in class. Staying together with them will certainly help with your conditions.

**Aroma**<br>
The Academy...

**Helena**<br>
Although you've been absent for more than one semester, as long as you pass the continuation exam, you can stay in your original class. Aroma was a top student; you can definitely do it!

**Aroma**<br>
Hmm...

**Noah**<br>
How did it go? Is she feeling alright?

**Helena**<br>
Ah, even though you've met him before; do you remember him? Your sister's husband Noah.

**Aroma**<br>
......

**Noah**<br>
......

**Aroma**<br>
No... I don't remember.

**Helena**<br>
Oh, how unfortunate, Mr. "forgotten savior".

**Noah**<br>
Haha... I don't mind.<br>
Aroma, I'm Noah; I'm your sister's husband. I'm also currently your attending physician. We live in the same apartment. If you have any problems, feel free to rely on me.

**Aroma**<br>
Got it... Thank you.

**Helena**<br>
Don't be fooled by his demeanor... He's the least reliable person in this household.

**Aroma**<br>
Haha......

**Noah**<br>
That's mean... Here, Aroma; put this on.

**Aroma**<br>
?

**Noah**<br>
These three suspending devices are stabilizers. You are required to wear them 24/7. Since you are still recovering from surgery, you may experience phantom nausea or dizziness, even hallucinations at times. These devices can help suppress those symptoms.

**Aroma**<br>
......

**Noah**<br>
Of course, these aftereffects are all temporary, just like your memory loss. The operation was a huge success and your brain is now in great condition. Therefore, these symptoms will gradually disappear as time goes on. Your memory will gradually recover as well. When that time comes, we can live happily together again, like how we used to.

**Aroma**<br>
Yes...

**Noah**<br>
These devices also have the function to monitor brainwaves. If they detect anything abnormal, they will instantly contact us via a built\-in application. If you feel any discomfort or encounter any other problem, just press this button. By doing so, we'll be able to know your situation and location right away.

**Helena**<br>
Aroma, if you have any problems, please tell us. We are all here by your side.

**Aroma**<br>
Understood. Thank you so much.

**Helena**<br>
......

**Noah**<br>
It's the least we can do.
