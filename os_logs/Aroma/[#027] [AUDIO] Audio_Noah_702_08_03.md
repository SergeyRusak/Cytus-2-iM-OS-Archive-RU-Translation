**Helena**<br>
Aroma, be careful.

**Aroma**<br>
Sister, I'm fine... You don't have to hold on to me.

**Noah**<br>
You just got discharged. Let your sister help you out, just in case.

**Helena**<br>
He has a point. Here, give me your hand.

**Aroma**<br>
Oh... okay.

**Helena**<br>
The fans are all worried about you. Look at all these letters and gifts.

**Aroma**<br>
I saw them.<br>
Since I already arrived home, I need to report my status to everyone on iM.

**Helena**<br>
Aroma, I'm coming in?<br>
How are you doing? Do you feel any discomfort?

**Aroma**<br>
I'm doing fine... My head doesn't hurt anymore.

**[Tuner-san]**<br>
*Time right now: 21:00. Medicine time! Medicine time!*

**Helena**<br>
Ah, I'll go prepare it for you. You like your water hot but not too hot, right?

**Aroma**<br>
... Sister, when we were little... where did we live?

**Helena**<br>
Eh? Quadrant II 02 street... What's the matter? Did you remember something?

**Aroma**<br>
... Is it Node 03?

**Helena**<br>
... No, it's Node 08.<br>
If we have the time, I should take you back for a visit. However, right now, you should rest some more. Don't overthink yourself.

**Aroma**<br>
Have I ever been to Node 03 before then?

**Helena**<br>
Eh? Let me think... When you're around fourteen, we did have plans to go there during one of Noah's long breaks... However, the travel agency told us that it's quite dangerous there, so we ended up not going.

**Aroma**<br>
Is that so...

**Helena**<br>
Aroma?

**Aroma**<br>
Ah, nothing...

**Helena**<br>
... You should stop thinking about these first. You need to let your brain rest. I'll go get your medicine.

**Aroma**<br>
Thank you.

*\[Singing\]*

**Aroma**<br>
\*そろそろ試合終了の鐘を鳴らしてよレフェリー<br>
いつの間に 氷も溺れたアイスティー\*

**Helena**<br>
Why are you practicing singing again? Noah told you that you need to rest for now...

**Aroma**<br>
It's okay... I'm just humming it casually.

**Helena**<br>
Aroma, you like singing way too much. How troublesome...<br>
Here, take your medicine. Once you're done with that, you can go to bed early.

**Aroma**<br>
Thank you.

**Helena**<br>
What song was that? It was great.

**Aroma**<br>
Has sister not heard this before?

**Helena**<br>
Yep. Even though I know nothing about singing, I remember every single one of your songs clearly, including those that are still just DEMOs.<br>
That melody you were just humming feels really nice. Is it Aroma's own creation?

**Aroma**<br>
I don't know... It's probably...... I think? The words just come out themselves without me realizing.

**Helena**<br>
It really is a great song. A very fresh style too.<br>
It's getting late. We should record it tomorrow. I'll let the composers have a listen.

**Aroma**<br>
It somehow feels like...

**Helena**<br>
Hmm?

**Aroma**<br>
... Nothing. I... I really like this song.
