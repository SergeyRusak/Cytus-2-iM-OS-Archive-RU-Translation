**Helena**<br>
I'm back... Yikes... Why is it so dark?<br>
Aroma? Noah?

**Aroma, Noah**<br>
Happy birthday!

**[Tuner-san]**<br>
*Happy birthday! Happy birthday!*

**Helena**<br>
Eh? Awww... I told you that you don't have to celebrate my birthday.

**Noah**<br>
This is Aroma's idea.

**Helena**<br>
Aroma...?

**Aroma**<br>
... Yes. I feel like sister has been feeling a bit down recently. I hope this can cheer you up a bit...

**Helena**<br>
......

**Noah**<br>
Aroma even prepared a present for you. Come, sit here.

*\[Song（Night Keepers - Bring the light）\]*

**Aroma**<br>
\*Every time we hide  <br>
Into shadow that can make us feel love <br>
Eat the sorrow drink a cup of fear\*

**Helena**<br>
It's been a while since I last heard you sing...

**Aroma**<br>
I've finished... Sister, I wish you a happy birthday.

**Helena**<br>
Thank you... *\*Sobs\**...

**Noah**<br>
Come on; she prepared this to cheer you up. Why are you crying?

**Aroma**<br>
Umm... I know that my memory loss has made sister very sad. However, during this time, both sister and Noah have been so kind to me. I was so happy being together with you guys...

**Helena**<br>
Aroma...

**Aroma**<br>
Therefore, I'm going to reinstate my contract with Monophonic Entertainment.

**Noah, Helena**<br>
Eh?

**Noah**<br>
So you've made your decision?

**Aroma**<br>
Yes... These days, I've been viewing the recordings on Tuner\-san. I thought about it a lot... I still can't remember most things; however, if this is the old me... if this is the dream we were pursuing together, then I believe I should continue to realize it.

**Helena**<br>
... Are you sure about that? You were so against it before...

**Aroma**<br>
It's ok. Besides, when I'm singing... I truly feel relaxed, and happy too. I guess I must've really loved singing. Haha...

**Noah**<br>
I agree. By working towards a previous goal, that experience should help with the recovery of your memory as well.

**Aroma**<br>
Yes. Even though I don't remember anything from the past, I believe it's not too late to start creating more happy memories now... Therefore, I hope sister can cheer up and not feel depressed anymore. Is that ok...?

**Helena**<br>
Idiot... I cried because I was so happy.

**Noah**<br>
Then we have another thing worthy of celebration today. Let's light the candles and cut the cake!

**Aroma**<br>
Ah, I'll go get the utensils.

**Noah**<br>
I'll help too. Today, you can take a break because you're the star of the show!

**Helena**<br>
Haha... OK.

**Helena**<br>
......

**Helena**<br>
Thank you, Aroma...
