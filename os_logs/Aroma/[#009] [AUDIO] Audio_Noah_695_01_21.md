**[Chris]**<br>
*Hi~ Good morning. Is Aroma there?*

**Helena**<br>
She is. Here, Aroma. It's for you.

**Aroma**<br>
... Hello.

**[Chris]**<br>
*Long time no see. How are you feeling? Is everything alright?*

**Aroma**<br>
I'm fine

**[Chris]**<br>
*It truly was an unfortunate disaster... Thank goodness that all the troublesome stuff is now over. It's about time we reinstate our contract too...*

**Helena**<br>
You're talking about her debut, right?

**[Chris]**<br>
*Yes, that. The good thing is that we disclosed the information right away. News about the car accident was not widespread. Of course, the hype has died down a bit during her year of absence. Our marketing department has come up with several proposals. I'll mail them to you later...*

**Helena**<br>
Before I read your proposals, I want to make one thing clear. Do not mention the car accident unless the situation absolutely calls for it. Focus on Aroma's actual talent first. That way, her public image will be a positive and healthy one.

**[Chris]**<br>
*Understood... Oh, and another thing. We have plans for her to resume training at Monophonic HQ sometime next week. She should be fine with that, right?*

**Helena**<br>
Before that, I want to confirm one thing. Regarding the recovery training lessons, the accident clause in the contract stated that the company will cover the entire cost. Is that correct?

**[Chris]**<br>
*... Yes, yes, exactly as you said. Man, you sure don't miss a beat, like ever...*

**Helena**<br>
Of course I don't. <br>
The medical team has given us the green light to start performing again... However, the one who has the final say is herself. Aroma, what do you think? Can you start training again?

**Aroma**<br>
......

**[Chris]**<br>
*...... Aroma?*

**Helena**<br>
......

**[Chris]**<br>
*Are there any other concerns? I can still alter my proposals to the higher\-ups...*

**Helena**<br>
Thanks, Chris. Aroma is fine with the arrangement. However, I would like you to put everything on hold for now. Act as if we are still considering. Don't rush to start the process right away.

**[Chris]**<br>
*You said don't rush... but the CEO has been constantly pressuring me to get going though? He seems to think that Aroma should make her debut as soon as possible...*

**Helena**<br>
I don't care. You'll have to find a way to deal with him. That's it for now.

**[Chris]**<br>
*No, wait a sec...*

*[Call Ends]*

**Helena**<br>
What's wrong...? Are you still worried about your body? I believe that continuing to pursue your previous dream should help treat your memory loss as well.

**Aroma**<br>
... Dream...?

**Helena**<br>
This was your previously your biggest goal. On the day of the accident, we were on our way to your debut event. Do you remember?

**Aroma**<br>
I don't remember... Becoming an idol... I can't grasp that idea. Feels kinda... scary...

**Helena**<br>
......

**Aroma**<br>
... I'm sorry... Can you let me think about it a little longer?

**Helena**<br>
Dumb child, no need to apologize... You don't have to force yourself to do this. Just do whatever you feel comfortable.

**Aroma**<br>
Thank you, sister.
