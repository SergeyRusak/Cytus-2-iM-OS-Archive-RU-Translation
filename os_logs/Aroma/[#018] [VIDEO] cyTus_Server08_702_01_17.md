**Chris**<br>
Hoho, here comes the megastar

**Cherry**<br>
Hello PAFF, sis Helena too~ Looking forward to working with you today!

**Aroma**<br>
Yes, same here.

**Helena**<br>
Let's work hard together.

**Lumy**<br>
Hey, Cherry, where did you put the sheet music for this song? If you're done with it, put it back to its original spot... OTL

**Cherry**<br>
I didn't take it? Are you at home right now? You can just send another copy from home. Problem solved...

**Lumy**<br>
Argh... Oh god oh crap oh no...

**Chris**<br>
Why is Lumy so skittish today?

**Cherry**<br>
This is her first time partcipating in a virtual internet performance of this size ==

**ROBO_Head**<br>
This unit number of performances in virtual internet: 89.

**Cherry**<br>
Wow, so ROBO is here too

**Lumy**<br>
BTW, the rehearsal has already begun. Why is Æsir still MIA?

**Chris**<br>
Man, what a bizzare performance. The host is nowhere to be found from start to finish, yet every link is exactly where it needs to be. <br>
There is not a single thing for us to worry about

**Cherry**<br>
Eh? You're kidding; so not even Chris knows what he looks like? I thought that you were the one in contact with him all this time. What about sis Helena?

**Helena**<br>
Nope. He contacts us via email. For the settings, he sent us the entire configuration; all we had to do was apply it. This scale... he is indeed quite capable.

**Lumy**<br>
Then what about Robohead? If there's one person that can see him, it's going to be you

**ROBO_Head**<br>
This unit similar situation as Miss Helena. Contact via connection only.

**Cherry**<br>
Dang he sure is mysterious... I wonder what he actually looks like?<br>
All we ever see is his avatar on cyTus

**Lumy**<br>
Yeah, I thought I could finally meet him at the rehearsal. Who knew...

**Cherry**<br>
Even if he does show up, there's the possibility that he'll show up as his avatar

**ROBO_Head**<br>
Real Æsir searching...<br>
Result: No matching account in block

**Cherry**<br>
So not even ROBO can find him...<br>
I guess we safely assume that nobody ever saw him in person @@

**Lumy**<br>
But he's absent from the rehearsal. Does he not need practice?

**Helena**<br>
He is the legendary DJ after all. I supposed he can manage himself just fine. We'll do what we can to present the best performance; that's all we can do.

**Aroma**<br>
Sister, sister...

**Helena**<br>
Hm? What's the matter, Aroma?

**Aroma**<br>
Is NEKO not here?

**Helena**<br>
She is not participating in this event.

**Chris**<br>
Ah, I heard that she did receive an invitation. However, when she saw that there will be a lot of Mono's artists, she immediately said "No bleepin way"<br>
She even went on the internet to bad mouth us. What a troublesome child...

**Aroma**<br>
I see... I was thinking about apologizing to her for the incident with the album...

**Helena**<br>
Idiot, there's nothing you have to apologize for. Those disputes are between her and the company. Let the company handle them.<br>
Aroma only has to focus on singing. You don't have to worry about random things. Is that ok?

**Aroma**<br>
OK...
