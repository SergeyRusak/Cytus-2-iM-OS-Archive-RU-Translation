**Chris**<br>
Looks like everyone is here\~ Sorry about this, Aroma. I know you're busy, yet I still asked you to come.

**Aroma**<br>
It's nothing...

**Helena**<br>
The next schedule is in two hours. If we count traveling time, rehearsal and preparation, you only have 30 minutes. So hurry up.<br>
About the performance invitation from this Æsir guy...

**Chris**<br>
You're so strict... If I recall the correctly, the next schedule doesn't require a performance. All she needs to do is show up. A small delay won't hurt.

**Helena**<br>
Being late will damage her image and will harm future partnerships. This is the one core principle of PR.<br>
29 minutes.

**Chris**<br>
Ok, ok\~<br>
Sis Helena, I bet you've already done your research on this "Legendary DJ". <br>
Am I right?

**Helena**<br>
I did so a long time ago. For any content creator that has the possibility of partnering with Aroma someday, I will try my best to collect information on them. That's how you expand your network.<br>
Of course, this is all under the premise that...

**Chris**<br>
Premise?

**Helena**<br>
That the company will not screw everything up and drive away precious assets.

**Chris**<br>
......

**Aroma**<br>
NEKO... Is she doing well after that? I want to collaborate with her again...

**Chris**<br>
Ha, hahaha... Cough, back to business. Regarding this Æsir, besides his music, we couldn't find any information about him on the internet.

**Helena**<br>
He hides his identity from the outside world. We don't even know whether he's male or female. However, judging from this proposal, he is definitely no newbie when it comes to organizing events.

**Chris**<br>
Indeed\~ This proposal is practically perfect; even the setup for the virtual space is very detailed. More importantly...

**Aroma**<br>
......?

**Chris**<br>
The remuneration. It's 10 percent higher than what the market price is. Hahaha!

**Aroma**<br>
......

**Helena**<br>
I've been wondering this since I saw the proposal. Our fees have never been publicized, right?

**Chris**<br>
Umm, no. In theory, the company will only inform those who approached us directly. <br>
I supposed he got the information from other organizers we've worked with in the past?

**Helena**<br>
If that's the case, that extra 10 percent is a part of his proposal. He is showing understanding of us, yet keeps the offer reasonable, all the while giving us bonus money as a sign of sincerity for his invitation. A cool\-headed and practical approach, I would say. <br>
...... However, I find the letter itself to be very odd.

**Chris**<br>
How so?

**Helena**<br>
Aroma is a very hot commodity right now. She receives new performance invitations every week. Most invitations are either very respectful, sometimes overly so, or use some kind of emotional connection to lure us into giving them more.

**Helena**<br>
On the other hand, this letter... it's brief and feels almost...wooden. It doesn't show his intentions at all, nor does it show passion for the event. However, it also has just enough emotion to make it not an automatic response.<br>
How should I put it...

**Aroma**<br>
Like he's trying to hide himself...

**Helena**<br>
Hm? Aroma, did you say something?

**Aroma**<br>
Ah, nothing...

**Chris**<br>
You do have a point. The company understands this as well\~ However, this proposal is pretty much perfect, be it planning or execution. <br>
If we also consider his share of voice online, Aroma's participation will bring her major benefits...

**Helena**<br>
You're right. That would be my decision too. Despite some concerns, I believe we can accept this invitation... Of course, I will be present at every rehearsal as well as the actual performance. I will also request the company to give us support of the highest standard.

**Chris**<br>
... When have you NOT asked for the highest standard?

**Helena**<br>
You got a problem with that?<br>
Aroma, what do you think? Want to go and meet this "legend"?

**Aroma**<br>
Yes... I want to sing a new song.

**Helena**<br>
No problem with that. The album that is estimated to release next year already has five DEMOs available. Which one do you want, Aroma? I'll contact the composer to speed up the process.

**Aroma**<br>
......

**Chris**<br>
Aroma, what's the matter? You've been looking outside the window all this time.

**Aroma**<br>
... Can I sing《Gravity》?

**Chris**<br>
Oh? Is there a particular reason?

**Aroma**<br>
I just feel like when I look down from a place this high, I get this feeling that I'm constantly falling... and find out that I'm in an unfamiliar place all of a sudden...<br>
Ah, I'm sorry. I don't know what I'm talking about either...

**Helena**<br>
... Understood. I'll take care of that.<br>
Chris, I'll take Aroma to her next schedule first. You organize the performance preparation plan for the next four months, as well as the virtual connection monitoring during the performance. Remember...

**Chris**<br>
Highest standard right? I know, I know\~

**Helena**<br>
Button up, slowpoke. If something goes wrong, I'm coming for you. Here, Aroma, let's go!

**Aroma**<br>
... OK.
