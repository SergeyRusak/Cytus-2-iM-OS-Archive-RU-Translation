**Aroma**<br>
... Then you use fraction here, and you can get the correct answer.

**Iris**<br>
Ah! You're right. I expect no less from Aroma. You're as smart as always.

**Aroma**<br>
You don't have to go that far...

**Aroma**<br>
But... this does ring a bell... I used to teach you math like this before too.

**Iris**<br>
Really!? Yeah, you did. My math was terrible. I had to rely on Aroma all the time.<br>
I'm so happy; another thing that you remembered!

**Classmate C**<br>
Ho\~? Really? Then that's great. You're starting to remember things about Iris one at a time.

**Classmate D**<br>
Yet you didn't remember any\~ thing about me. I'm so sad\~ Or could you choose what you forget?

**Other classmates**<br>
Pffft... Hehe...

**Aroma**<br>
Ah... I...

**Iris**<br>
You guys... What are you doing?

**Classmate C**<br>
Nothing though? We want to be friends with Aroma too. You have a problem with that?

**Classmate D**<br>
Are you okay with that, Aroma? Are we qualified to keep being your friends? We used to be good friends too\~ Or do you only remember this dorky loser?

**Iris**<br>
......

**Classmate C**<br>
I've been wondering for a while now; what exactly are those three thingies on your head? Maybe they're the reason why you can't remember anything?

**Aroma**<br>
Ah... You can't take that!

**Classmate C**<br>
Hoho, they're surprisingly heavy. Can they float on my head as well? Lemme try... wow! They can!

**Classmate D**<br>
Nice! That's so cool! Let me give it a go!

**Iris**<br>
You guys! If you keep this up I'll call Clara here!

**Classmate C**<br>
Ooh, so you're calling the class rep. I'm so scared\~ or maybe she won't come cause she's the one that hates Aroma the most?

**Classmate D**<br>
Haha, that's true. Since all her crush sees is Aroma and not her.

**Iris**<br>
... S, stop spreading lies! Clara is not like that... Give Aroma back her things first!

**Classmate D**<br>
Yikes! What are you doing!? How dare you push me!

**Iris**<br>
Kyaaa!

**Classmate C**<br>
Woah... she fell down! Hey! Are you faking it so we get points deducted by the system? Guess you learned that trick from Aroma...<br>
Hmmmm... OUCH!?

**Aroma**<br>
... Help her up.

**Classmate C**<br>
Ouch! That hurt! Let go of me...<br>
......!?

**Aroma**<br>
Help her up, then apologize to her, now.

**Classmate C**<br>

**Other classmates**<br>

**Iris**<br>
Aroma...?

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Daniel**<br>
HEY! What the hell are you girls doing!? Give that back to her! What are you, grade schoolers!?

**Classmate C**<br>
Eh?.... Nothing... We're just joking with her.

**Classmate D**<br>
Ummm... Yeah, that's right. It's just a small joke. We want to see if joking around like this can help her regain her memory...

**Daniel**<br>
... I advise you to shut up and get the hell out of here before I go off on your a\*\*\*\*.

**Classmate C**<br>
Eek...... S, sorry!

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Daniel**<br>
Iris, are you alright? Here.

**Iris**<br>
Thank you...

**Daniel**<br>
... And you?

**Aroma**<br>
Ugh...

**Iris**<br>
Yikes! Aroma, you look really pale... We need to take her to the infirmary right away!

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Daniel**<br>
You girls go first. I'll be there in a minute.

**Daniel**<br>

**Daniel**<br>
... Enjoying the show, class rep?

**Clara**<br>
