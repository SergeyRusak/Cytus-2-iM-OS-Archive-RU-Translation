**Helena**<br>
Aroma, the elevator is here.

**Aroma**<br>
OK.

*\[Elevator Door Opens\]*

**Aroma**<br>
Woah, it's quite full...

**Helena**<br>
Can't help it. Let's squeeze in.

*\[Hurried Footsteps\]*

**Chris**<br>
W, wait, NEKO; y, you don't have to run so fast...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
If we don't hurry we won't make the meeting on time! Eheh, excuse me, excuse me! NEKO is boarding too!

*\[Collision\]*

**Aroma**<br>
OW!

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
OWWW! That hurt...

**Bodyguard T**<br>
Miss PAFF, are you alright!

**Bodyguard G**<br>
What the hell!? You again! Move!

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Yikes! What are you doing!? Let NEKO stand up first!

**Helena**<br>
Stop it. Check on PAFF first to make sure she's safe.<br>
Here, NEKO. Can you stand up?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
... Um, thank you.

**Helena**<br>
Are you okay? Any injuries? It's very dangerous to run in the hallways...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
No worries, all is well\~ NEKO falls down a lot, so I'm already used to it. Hehe\~

**Helena**<br>
I see. Good to see that you're fine.

**Aroma**<br>
I'm sorr...

**Passenger**<br>
Hey, are you people boarding or not?

**Bodyguard T**<br>
Ah, yes. Sorry about that!<br>
Miss PAFF, let's go inside first.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Ah, we're boarding as well...

*\[Elevator warning\]*

**[Elevator System]**<br>
*Warning: Weight limit exceeded. Please leave the elevator!*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
... EH?

**Everyone else**<br>
......

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Ehhhhh!? How come? Is this metal box telling NEKO that she's too fat? NEKO has been exercising really hard lately!

**Bodyguard G**<br>
Yeah, yeah, please get out. Stop wasting everyone else's time.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Yikes! You don't have to push...

**Aroma**<br>
Umm...

*\[Elevator door closes\]*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
......

**Chris**<br>
Haha... let's take the next one.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
ARGHHH!! I can't take it anymore!! What the heck is the deal with her!?

**Chris**<br>
！？

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
I mean PAFF! It's always sis Helena speaking for her! What is she, speech\-impaired!? She even told the two dumb bears to kick NEKO outside!<br>
You bumped into NEKO at least say sorry!

**Chris**<br>
Ummm... Weren't you the one who bumped into her...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Hmph!! We are still collaborating and writing songs together, yet I can't talk to her in person!? Who does she think she is! Idol my a\*\*\~ She's treating herself like some kind of queen! Arrogant bastard!

**Chris**<br>
Hey! Watch your words! PAFF is not that kind of person! She is working very hard on the song she wants you to arrange for her.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
...... Hmph, if the song sucks, NEKO won't even bother!

**Chris**<br>
That's not up to you... Besides, you better pay more attention to your actions and words, especially on the internet. Those fans of yours always lose control and cause trouble for no apparent reason. They are starting to get out of hand for us\~<br>
If this keeps going on, the company's image will be affected.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Yeah yeah! None of your business! Hmph!

**Chris**<br>
