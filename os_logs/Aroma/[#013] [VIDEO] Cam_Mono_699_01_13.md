**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Ya\-hello\~ Chris! About that song you asked for the day before yesterday, NEKO has finished it. I sent it to you this morning. Did you get it?

**Chris**<br>
... NEKO? I did say I received it.<br>
Why did you come to the company all of a sudden? I'm quite busy today...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
You thought NEKO made a trip here just to see you? Pffft, come on\~ NEKO is here to see PAFF!

**Chris**<br>
See PAFF!?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Isn't she recording today? NEKO wants to take a look.

**Chris**<br>
How did you know...?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
It's written on the calendar of the main recording studio. It says that PAFF is recording NEKO's song today. Your reaction just confirmed it!<br>
Damnit, I'm jelly\~ NEKO can only use the small studio.

**Chris**<br>
Ah...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Since we started this collab, we've only communicated via mail. NEKO wants to talk with PAFF in person as well\~ Can't wait to see how cute she is... Ohoho, I'm starting to drool\~ Slurp!

**Chris**<br>
Umm...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
They're almost done recording, right? Enough talking\~ NEKO's going inside. Bye\~

**Chris**<br>
Hey... hey, wait a minute!

**Helena**<br>
Good work, Aroma. You're in top form today.

**Aroma**<br>
Yes, I really like this song by NEKO. I hope she will like the song I wrote for her too...

**Helena**<br>
Her personality is a bit tough for me to handle though. I don't understand teenage girls these days... It shows even in her emails. What's the point of all those "Nyan Nyan Nyan"s when we are discussing the composing style?

**Aroma**<br>
Haha... It's cute though.

**Helena**<br>
Crap, we're a bit behind for our next scheduled event. We better hurry!

**Bodyguard T**<br>
I'll go get the car.

**Helena**<br>
Please.

**Aroma**<br>
Thanks for the good work.

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
What!? Let NEKO go through!

**Bodyguard G**<br>
Excuse me, please show us your visitor pass...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Big dumbo! NEKO has a keycard! I'm an employee!

**Aroma**<br>
......?

**Bodyguard G**<br>
Umm... Please wait here.

**Bodyguard G**<br>
Sister Helena, there's a girl outside who wants an interview, but she's not on the list...

**Helena**<br>
Eh? That's not part of today's schedule...<br>
Turn her down for me. We're seriously going to be late if the car doesn't come soon...

**Bodyguard G**<br>
Understood.

*\[Door Opens\]*

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

**[Bodyguard T]**<br>
*Sister Helena, the car is ready. The traffic is a bit busy right now. We could be cutting it a bit too close...*

**Helena**<br>
Understood.<br>
Aroma, let's go.

**Aroma**<br>
OK.

*\[Door Opens\]*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
AH! Liar! What do you mean she's not here? Unless I'm seeing things, that's PAFF right there!<br>
PAFF! Hello\~ HELLO!

**Aroma**<br>
Ah...

**Helena**<br>
So it's NEKO... that's awkward...<br>
However, we are really going to be late. PAFF, you get in the car first! I'll talk to her.

**Aroma**<br>
Eh? Just saying hi shouldn't take that long...

**Helena**<br>
No good. Arriving late is a major taboo in the business. The people in the next show are all seniors in the industry. You don't want to give the media gossip material, do you? Just go.

**Aroma**<br>
Alright...

**Helena**<br>
Hello, NEKO. The recording today went very smoothly. Thank you for the song you wrote.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Hello, sis Helena\~ Where's PAFF? NEKO is here today just for her! I even got stopped by this big furry Bear!

**Bodyguard G**<br>
... What did you say!?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Do you not know about it! The Bears from Stewrica! Lame!<br>
Eh, sis Helena, let NEKO and PAFF have some quick chit\-chat\~ It won't take too long!

**Helena**<br>
... Apologies, but she's in the car already... Maybe next time!<br>
I'll arrange a meeting for you two sometime later, is that ok?<br>
About the audio track for the recording, I'll have Chris play it to you.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Ehehehe? Why\~? Ok then... You have to make that arrangement though! Deal?

**Helena**<br>
Yes yes\~ It's a deal. Then I shall take my leave as well.
