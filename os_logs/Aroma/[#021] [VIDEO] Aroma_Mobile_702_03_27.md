**Helena**<br>
Aroma, are you alright? Did you get injured?

**Aroma**<br>
No... I'm fine.

**Helena**<br>
I'll ask the company to improve the training of the bodyguards. How could they let someone get so close to you...

**[Entertainment News]**<br>
*The reporter is at Monophonic Entertainment's Performance Hall I right now. We can see that PAFF's autograph session has already concluded. PAFF herself has also been escorted to the car and has left the site. <br>
As with the audience member who caused a commotion earlier, he has also been taken away from the site by bodyguards and law enforcement agents.*

**Helena**<br>
The news is already reporting this...

**[Entertainment News]**<br>
*What is the identity of this reckless man? According to witnesses, this man is a crazed fan who couldn't control his passion. He forced his way through the wall of bodyguards to have an intimate contact with PAFF. This action triggered the other fans on\-site, thus leading to a lot of pushing and shoving. In the commotion, several people were also injured. As of now, the suspect has been taken away by the Administration Bureau for further investigation.<br>
This is a photo of the suspect (male) taken by one of our reporters.*

**Helena**<br>
... The hell? This isn't the photo of that man at all! Moreover, that guy came running out of the media area, not the fan area.

**Aroma**<br>
......

**Helena**<br>
The media company definitely had this information suppressed...<br>
Damnit.

**Aroma**<br>
... Forget about it. That person didn't do any harm to me anyway. He just said some things to me...

**Helena**<br>
... What did he tell you?

**Aroma**<br>
Hmm... I don't really remember. I was so scared at the time that I couldn't really understand what he is saying...

**Helena**<br>
That's not good. This is a serious security issue. I'm absolutely going to have a meeting with the folks in the security department...

**Aroma**<br>
It somehow feels like...

**Helena**<br>
Hmm?

**Aroma**<br>
No... nothing at all.
