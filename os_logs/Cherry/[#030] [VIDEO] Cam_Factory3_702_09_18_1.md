**Xenon**<br>
……Sherry……Sherry！

**Cherry**<br>
Ah... I fell asleep...<br>
Woah! Sorry, I drooled all over your back...

**Xenon**<br>
... You can sleep while riding a motorcycle? You're amazing in a certain way.<br>
We arrived. Get off.

**Cherry**<br>
Here? Isn't it way too dark? There are not even streetlights here...

**Xenon**<br>
My helmet has night\-vision, you follow me.<br>
The coordinates are right below us. My guess is that it's in this factory.

**Cherry**<br>
Never thought that there's a ruin like this in Node 08...

**Xenon**<br>
Apparently, many facilities were shut down after the Decommission. No one knows how to operate them either, so they were just left here.

**Cherry**<br>
Then? How are we gonna get in? The entrance looks tightly locked.

**Xenon**<br>
Umm... I didn't think about that either. For starters, let's circle the facility to see if there's an opening where we can climb in and such?

**Cherry**<br>
... When it comes to tech, you're really smart. Everything else? You're a complete mess, be it back then or now...

**Xenon**<br>
Yes, yes, I know~ Then what kind of great idea do you have, Miss "Criminal Master"?

**Cherry**<br>
Shhhhh! Stay down! Something's there.

**[Recycle Robot]**<br>
*Recycle, recycle. Please put the discarded materials on the platform.<br>
Recycle, re... cycle. Please put ... the discarded materials... on the platform.*

**Xenon**<br>
It's the facility's robot. Has it been operating like that ever since this place was abandoned...?

**Cherry**<br>
Feels kinda sad...<br>
Look, it appears that they have a fixed travel path. Maybe it knows where to enter the building?

**Xenon**<br>
Possible. Let's follow it and see.

*[Switch signals to Cam 044]*

**Xenon**<br>
Got it. It opens that small door there. We can crawl inside.

*\[Security Robot Warning\]*

**[Security Robot]**<br>
Civilian, this is a prohibited area. Please identify yourself or leave. If not, you will be evicted by force.

**Xenon**<br>
WAH!

**[Security Robot]**<br>
Civilian...... prohibited. Please...... evicted by force. Initiate eviction process.

*\[Pulse Pistol Fires\]*

**Xenon**<br>
……!!

**[Security Robot]**<br>
Civilians...... prohibited...

**Xenon**<br>

**Xenon**<br>
... Did you destroy it?

**Cherry**<br>
Yeah. Good thing that these are old models. I've come across plenty of them; I know where to hit.

**Xenon**<br>
You carry something like that with you all the time...? Is that legal?

**Cherry**<br>
For self\-defense purposes... That door's closing; let's move!

*[Signal Lost]*
