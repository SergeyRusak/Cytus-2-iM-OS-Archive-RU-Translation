Miss Sherry, how are you feeling today?

**Cherry**<br>
I'm feeling fine, doctor.

**Jacob**<br>
Congratulations, you're now medically fit for discharge. You should be able to leave the hospital this afternoon.

**Cherry**<br>
It's just scraps and bruises. A day in the hospital is a bit of an overreaction, don't you think...

**Jacob**<br>
Since you displayed slight symptoms of a concussion, we decided to be extra careful. Apologies.

**Cherry**<br>
It's OK. Thank you for the treatment.

**Jacob**<br>
How unfortunate of you to be involved in that kind of riot. It must be tough being an artist...

**Cherry**<br>
Haha... I don't mind though. It's PAFF after all. It's pretty much expected that her disappearance will cause the fans to lose control.

**Jacob**<br>
Get some rest. There are still some procedures you will have to go through. Once you are done with those, you will be discharged.

**Nurse**<br>
Doctor!

**Jacob**<br>
What's wrong? Why are you in such a panic?

**Nurse**<br>
The patient in P29\-015 is having epileptic seizures again!

**Jacob**<br>
Shannon? How is that...? ... Have you tried TIVA?

**Nurse**<br>
Already did! It was not effective. You said that a dose of over 45ml could be potentially dangerous...

**Jacob**<br>
Understood. I'll be on my way right now!

**Cherry**<br>
Excuse me! Umm... Shannon... could you be talking about a Shannon Jackson?

**Jacob**<br>
... Yes. Do you know her?

**Cherry**<br>
I'm her friend! Can I see her...?

**Jacob**<br>
The patient is not in a stable condition right now, so it might be a bit difficult... We'll deal with her current symptoms first. If her condition stabilizes later in the day, I'll schedule an afternoon visit for you. Are you fine with that?

**Cherry**<br>
Please! Thank you!
