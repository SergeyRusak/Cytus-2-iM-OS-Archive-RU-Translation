**JOE**<br>
Whew...... Finally got the Ciber driver to send them away... Big sis, are you even human? You took down all of them by yourself! And you don't even look one bit flustered...

*\[Glasses clanging\]*

**JOE**<br>
Hey! Big sis!?

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

**JOE**<br>
You awake?

**Cherry**<br>
Ugh... how long have I been asleep?

**JOE**<br>
Just around 20 minutes. I'm going to start closing the shop. You should rest a bit more.

**Cherry**<br>
Sorry, I did drink too much after all... haha...

**JOE**<br>
The amount you drank is ridiculous even for you... Now that I think about it, I've never seen you drunk.

**Cherry**<br>
Sorry for causing you the trouble...

**JOE**<br>
Nah, it's fine, as long as you don't throw up on the table. I'll escort you home later.

**Cherry**<br>
Hmm... thanks.

**JOE**<br>
Don't thank me so soon. I'm gonna charge you like Ciber. Your home is so damn far away; you really thought I will give you a free ride?

**Cherry**<br>
Haha... Your brain still reeks with the stink of money...

**JOE**<br>
Why do you speak the exact same words as Simon...?

**Cherry**<br>
... Simon...<br>
Nah, have you... seen him recently?

**JOE**<br>
Eh? Ah... at the end of last month, I ran into him at the cemetery. We had a quick chat.

**Cherry**<br>
I see... I can't reach him for some reason.

**JOE**<br>
......<br>
Is there... something you need to tell him?

**Cherry**<br>
...... A while ago, at hospital 15, I ran into Shannon...

**JOE**<br>
... EH!?

**Cherry**<br>
She was locked inside a special ward and was unable to talk... visitors couldn't enter the ward to see her either...

**JOE**<br>
......

**Cherry**<br>
Afterward, I've been trying to have a chat with Simon... However, after the Æsir incident was over... he seems to be hiding from me...

**JOE**<br>
Big sis......

**Cherry**<br>
I'm so foolish... After all the things that happened, I still hoped that he'll talk to me...... Even though that itself is already a luxury......

**JOE**<br>
......

**Cherry**<br>
*\*Sobs\**

**JOE**<br>
... Get some sleep. Don't blame yourself... We're all living in guilt for our crimes...
