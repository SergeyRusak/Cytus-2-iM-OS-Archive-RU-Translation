*\[Heavy things falling down\]*

**Angus**<br>
Here, three P30s. Check them yourself.

**Cherry**<br>
... Impressive. You actually got them.

**Angus**<br>
What else do you expect? We're the Baro Brotherhood.

*\[Checking the guns\]*

**Cherry**<br>
Hmm... All in great condition. Should work just fine.

**Angus**<br>
The Boss said that if you like them, you can keep one after the transaction is over.

**Cherry**<br>
......

**Angus**<br>
What's wrong? Aren't you a gun maniac? Shouldn't you be more happy for stuff like this?

**Cherry**<br>
... Yeah, thanks.

**Hunter**<br>
Ah, Capo, big sis! I've been looking for you guys for quite some time!

**Angus**<br>
What's the matter?

**Hunter**<br>
Got some info about making money! There's this "R" guy who's hiring gunmen through Cafe. He's paying some serious big bucks!

**Angus**<br>
R...? Oh, isn't he the one who specializes in information trading?

**Hunter**<br>
Yep. The operation this time is that he plans to "jailbreak" a criminal out from the restricted area.

**Angus**<br>
Hmm... The reward is indeed very high. Who is this person he's trying to save?

**Hunter**<br>
It's not stated clearly on the request, but the boys from other teams have speculated from this proposal... that this person is very likely Simon Jackson. Ya know, the one who got busted just recently.

**Cherry**<br>
......!

**Angus**<br>
Simon? Isn't he the guy who caused quite the headache for the organization? Hey, I advise you to stay out of this. From what I can tell, the Boss seems quite happy about his arrest.

**Cherry**<br>
......

**Hunter**<br>
But this money...

**Angus**<br>
Didn't I tell you not to go off the tracks and do something stupid? Right now, Boss is treating our team quite well. There's no need for us to do something that is against his will.

**Cherry**<br>
Give me the request.

**Angus**<br>
... What do you want to do? You're not thinking about rescuing your boyfriend, are you?

**Cherry**<br>
... What I want to do is none of your business, right?

**Angus**<br>
You're not part of the organization, so I won't interfere with your actions. Just make sure that it won't affect the transaction that's happening in a few days.

**Hunter**<br>
Big sis, let me tag along! I'll show you my improved gun skills...

**Angus**<br>
Mad dog, I will not repeat this a third time... DON'T go off the tracks and do something stupid. You're a dog, so behave like one.

**Hunter**<br>
Tch...

**Cherry**<br>
......
