**Luis**<br>
... Still mad with daddy?

**Cherry**<br>
......

**Luis**<br>
I'm sorry. Daddy didn't do it on purpose. And look, I did see you on the podium. Took pictures too.

**Cherry**<br>
... The competition is already finished at that point! You said you will definitely come. LIAR!!

**Luis**<br>
WAAH! Don't shake! Daddy's still riding the bike; it's dangerous.

**Cherry**<br>
Who cares. All you do is lie anyway...

**Luis**<br>
... Come on, don't be angry. I know! I'll take you to uncle Ben's shop later. You can pick out a toy, anything you want and daddy will buy it for you!

**Cherry**<br>
... Anything?

**Luis**<br>
Anything!

**Cherry**<br>
Then I want a「SENA GAMEBAI III」.

**Luis**<br>
Eh? A gaming console...? That's a bit expensive...

**Cherry**<br>
You said ANYTHING! Are you going to lie to me again?

**Luis**<br>
Alright, alright! You can get it!

**Cherry**<br>
Also no more lying. If you can't come, say you can't come. Every time you just agreed without considering, Sherry doesn't like that...

**Luis**<br>
OK... Daddy just doesn't want you to be unhappy.

**Cherry**<br>
... I know that daddy is busy with work. We don't have a mom in our home, so it's hard...

**Luis**<br>
... You're such a good kid.<br>
I'm sorry; daddy's such a useless daddy.

**Cherry**<br>
No kidding. You rea\~lly are a useless daddy. *\*Chuckles\**

**Luis**<br>
Woah! Directly hearing it from Sherry still hurts quite a bit. Haha...

**Cherry、Luis**<br>
Ahahahaha!

**Cherry**<br>
... Because you are a useless daddy, Sherry has to be more independent. I can't rely on daddy so much anymore.

**Luis**<br>
......

**Cherry**<br>
Even if you're a useless daddy, you're still the best daddy...

**Luis**<br>
……Sherry……
