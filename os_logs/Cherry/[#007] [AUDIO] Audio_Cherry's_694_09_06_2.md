**JOE**<br>
Hey, as we are talking, there he is.

**Xenon**<br>
*\*Huff\**... I'm back. *\*Huff\**... *\*Puff\**

**Cherry**<br>
What's up? Someone after you a\*\*?

**Xenon**<br>
*\*Huff\**... Something like that... Here, I bought some drinks and snacks. <br>
Happy birthday.

**Cherry**<br>
Oh... thanks.

**JOE**<br>
Jasus! That's quite a lot of booze. How drunk do you want to get?

**KAI**<br>
I thought you were the Alcohol Master of Quadrant III? Show us what you got.

**Cherry**<br>
None of these are very strong stuff though.

**KAI**<br>
Hmm? Quite experienced aren't you, big sis.

**Cherry**<br>
I told you I drink quite often. So what do you say, Alcohol Master? Let's get going!

**JOE**<br>
Umm... let's open the presents before we drink! Here's a gift prepared by yours truly.

**Cherry**<br>
So there are presents too? This is the first time I get presents from someone besides my father.

**JOE**<br>
Well then be prepared to get them every year after! Now open it!

**Cherry**<br>
Alright alright...

*\[Opens Present\]*

**Cherry**<br>
Uh... what's this?

**JOE**<br>
Optic therapy set! I saw this selling for cheap in the shopping area, so I ordered it. Didn't you mention that your face is a little puffy? With this set, you can obtain the golden ratio and become the idol of the new generation by simply lying down!

**Cherry**<br>
My face is not THAT puffy! Idiot! Dumbass! Die!

**JOE**<br>
No! Not the hair!

**Xenon**<br>
It's your fault for being so insincere. You deserve it. 

**KAI**<br>
Yeah. Now here's mine.

*\[Opens Present\]*

**Cherry**<br>
Wow! A signed copy of GuluJam's Giraffe! Where in the world did you get it!?

**KAI**<br>
Pretty awesome right? There are only 10 copies in the entire Node. Preserve it well. Next time, we'll go see them perform.

**Cherry**<br>
YES of course! I'm going to treat it like the treasure of my life! Just a heads up, there's no way I can prepare a gift that can surpass this on your birthday...

**KAI**<br>
Haha, it's ok. Simon, how about yours?

**Xenon**<br>
It's here... but, I think it's better for you to open it sometime later...

**Cherry**<br>
Hoho? What are you trying to hide? Give it to me! Let me take a look...

*\[Opens Present\]*

**Cherry**<br>
......

**JOE**<br>
Pf, Pfhahahahah! What the heck? A necklace with a small cub!? No way in hell would she fancy something like this! Hahahaha!

**KAI**<br>
Pfft! Hard to say, maybe big sis will be surprisingly "Kawaii" with this necklace, hahahaha! Great present, I give it 10 JOEs for its crappiness!

**Xenon**<br>
... I asked my sister to pick a present. She picked this!

**KAI**<br>
So it's Shannon...pfft! Yep, looks like something she would pick. Can't help it then.

**JOE**<br>
Man, how dare you call me out for being insincere when your present is the suckiest!? And you had your sister pick it! What the heck!? Hahaha!

**Xenon**<br>
Sorry...

**Cherry**<br>
What sorry? Now drink! I'm going to get all you boys so drunk that you forget everything!

**Xenon**<br>
Wait, I really can't...
