**JOE**<br>
I'm the King of Germs!!

**KAI**<br>
Get your a\*\* back here you moron!! Give me back my drumsticks!

**Xenon**<br>
Haha... he is VERY drunk.

**KAI**<br>
You two, go back in the house. It's really cold outside. I'll go chase him down. HEY! Where the heck do you think you're going!

**Cherry**<br>
Woah, it is really cold. Let's go up.

**Xenon**<br>
OK.

*[→Signal switch to Cam\_Elevator\_02]*

**Xenon**<br>
Are you ok? Feeling drunk?

**Cherry**<br>
I'm fine.

**Xenon**<br>
You sure? You live on floor 48, right? You picked the top floor.

**Cherry**<br>
Be quiet and just come with me.

**Xenon**<br>
Why are we up here? I'm gonna freeze to death...

**Cherry**<br>
It's almost time for sunrise. We can see it here.

**Xenon**<br>
There's quite a bit of cloud though. Isn't that quite unlikely?

**Cherry**<br>
We can see it, I'm sure. Every time I'm in a bad mood, I'll visit here at this time.<br>
Seeing the sunrise gives me a feeling that the world is still going on. It will keep going on, with or without me. Once I'm aware of how insignificant I am, everything seems to feel better.

**Xenon**<br>
Didn't realize that you're such a romantic person...

**Cherry**<br>
Haha... don't kid yourself. You knew that, didn't you?<br>
Thank you for the necklace. Shannon is not the one who picked it, right?

**Xenon**<br>
Ah... yeah. Last time we went out for food, you were staring at it for a long time. You really wanted to buy it, didn't you?

**Cherry**<br>
But it was gone when I visited the shop later by myself. Where did you find it?

**Xenon**<br>
Didn't you mention that someone was after my a\*\*? I had to run to so many shops before I could find one that looks the same.

**Cherry**<br>
......

**Xenon**<br>
Sorry for embarrassing you in front of the guys. I feel that you don't really want other people to know that you like cute things.

**Cherry**<br>
... It's ok. Today is the first time that I had friends celebrate my birthday for me. I was so happy.

**Xenon**<br>
The happiest you got was for KAI's present, right? You had quite the reaction.

**Cherry**<br>
Nope, it's yours.<br>
You always notice all the little details. You were the one who organized this birthday surprise too. Are you secretly a girl or something...?

**Xenon**<br>
I didn't really organize it... I just told them that your birthday may be right around the corner. They were the ones who came up with the plan and other crap. I was sort of forced into... HMM!?

**Cherry**<br>
... If you treat me so kindly, you can't blame me for falling for you, can you?

**Xenon**<br>
......

**Cherry**<br>
See, I told you we can see it here, didn't I? The sunrise.
