**Cherry**<br>
... I was too scared to hear your answer, so I ran away... haha...

**Xenon**<br>
I was planning to say "I don't know" back then... but if you ask me that same question again now...

**Cherry**<br>
Then... can you let me finish what I should have said back then?

**Xenon**<br>
... Go ahead.

**Cherry**<br>
... I'm really, really... sorry...<br>
Regardless of the reasons I have, the lives that perished because of me will never return. Shannon is in her current state because of me as well... Therefore, I never expected you to forgive me with just this one apology, but I really want you to know how heartbroken I was, how regretful I was...<br>
I'm very grateful that you saved him and protected me. If it wasn't for you, I won't be able to stand on the stage and perform now either.<br>
You are the most important person in my life. The fact that I was unable to contact you these past six years was an extremely cruel punishment for me...<br>
I'm sorry... *\*sniffs\**...

**Xenon**<br>
......

**Cherry**<br>
...... Eh? Haha... so weird... I was planning to keep a straight face while telling you this stuff... Why am I crying...? Sorry.

**Xenon**<br>
... I've been thinking these past few days... Maybe the person I couldn't forgive for these six years wasn't you, or even him.

**Cherry**<br>
...Huh?

**Xenon**<br>
It's myself.<br>
If I cared about you more back then, maybe those incidents would never happen...

**Cherry**<br>
... You already the person who cared for me the second\-most in my life.

**Xenon**<br>
The one who cared for you the most was put in the restricted area by me...<br>
Must be pretty tough these years for you, wasn't it?

**Cherry**<br>
To be honest with you, when the admins came, I was prepared to be arrested as well, but they only took away father...

**Xenon**<br>
Yeah... I tampered with the evidence so you would come out clean.

**Cherry**<br>
Why wouldn't you let me be arrested along with my father?

**Xenon**<br>
You know I couldn't do that.

**Cherry**<br>
... Maybe it's better to be arrested that day...

**Xenon**<br>
Hm? What did you say?

**Cherry**<br>
Nothing... you should stop being a "nice guy", you look like an idiot...

**Xenon**<br>
I'm trying.

**Cherry**<br>
Then your trying doesn't seem to work. Look at yourself now...

**[Xenon-A.I.]**<br>
*Rewind complete. Communication records that match criteria: 1.*

**Xenon**<br>
It's done... Awesome, the range is reduced significantly. Only a distance of two coordinates.<br>
Looks like we can directly confirm the location... Quadrant I, looks like an abandoned factory.

**Cherry**<br>
Huh? Didn't you say that we still need two to three more rewinds?

**Xenon**<br>
The A.I. is more efficient than I thought. No need for another rewind, let's just go.

**Cherry**<br>
EH? NOW!?

**Xenon**<br>
Strike while the iron is hot. Besides, we would stand out too much if we visit a place like this in broad daylight.
