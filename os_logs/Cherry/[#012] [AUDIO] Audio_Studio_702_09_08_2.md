**[Xenon-A.I.]**<br>
*Data Recorded. Analyzing...*

**Cherry**<br>
Wow, what is that?

**Xenon**<br>
It's an A.I. I wrote. During the time I lost my memory, it had been investigating suspicious connections to the Æsir event for me. Yet I had no idea it was doing this.

**Cherry**<br>
You're also a victim?

**Xenon**<br>
Really don't want to admit it... but yeah. That day, I was backstage and was also affected. Similar to you, only until ROBO\-Head's recent post did I remember what actually happened in between.<br>
Before that, when my A.I. kept sending me anonymous emails, I spent quite a while figuring out who's behind those emails. Turns out it was myself...

**Cherry**<br>
Haha... what is it doing now?

**Xenon**<br>
I want it to analyze the time periods where the admins will not pay that much attention to the security cameras at the locations you wrote down.<br>
After the humans took over the administration bureau, the difference is that they need to change shifts. There's quite a time gap between the shifts. I'll use that gap to visit those locations to rewind.

**Cherry**<br>
... You sound like a criminal. You'll be quite terrifying if you ever went down that path...

**Xenon**<br>
... You're the last person who has the right to tell me that.

**Cherry**<br>
Ah... Sorry...

**Xenon**<br>
On a side note, have you ever seen the female with a hoodie in this photo? This is the final result of my A.I.'s investigation. I feel that this person has a lot to do with the Æsir event.

**Cherry**<br>
... No, I haven't. I've never come in contact with him in real life, or even via a mediator. He always contacted me directly with text...

**[Xenon-A.I.]**<br>
*Analysis Complete.*

**Xenon**<br>
It's done. The biggest time gap at this location, Quadrant III, 76th street, is September 15th at 02:00 p.m. I'll have plenty of time to investigate this location beforehand.

**Cherry**<br>
Ah, yes. That was where I received the first invitation. I should go with you.

**Xenon**<br>
NO, it's too dangerous.

**Cherry**<br>
If I go with you, I might be able to recall the more exact time and location. It's easier for you this way, isn't it?

**Xenon**<br>
... Still no. I'm going by myself.

**Cherry**<br>
That's a public location. If I want to pop up there at that exact time, you can't stop me, can you? Let me help.

**Xenon**<br>
... Alright, you win.<br>
Be careful yourself. When we arrive there, we don't want to stay too close to each other. We will communicate with the frequency transceiver. If you ever remember anything, tell me.

**Cherry**<br>
This is just like a spy movie.

**Xenon**<br>
This is not a movie though... stay cautious.
