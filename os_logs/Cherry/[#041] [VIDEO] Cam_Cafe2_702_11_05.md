**Cherry**<br>
Hi\~

**JOE**<br>
Big sis.

**Cherry**<br>
You're not open yet? Can I get a drink?

**JOE**<br>
Of course. Want would you like?

**Cherry**<br>
... Milk.

**JOE**<br>
... Simon... I didn't think he would actually get arrested...

**Cherry**<br>
......

**JOE**<br>
The admins have released the investigation report used in court, as well as his confession...

**Cherry**<br>
I don't understand why he would make that kind of speculation himself and admit that he is Æsir...<br>
Something's definitely messed up. After all, he and I investigated this case together for a long time. We even got assaulted by a weird robot. It's as if he has forgotten about all these things...

**JOE**<br>
That incident... how many people knew about it?

**Cherry**<br>
Not many. Besides the two of us who were part of the action, the only other ones are probably the very few A.R.C. employees who participated.

**JOE**<br>
You saw the court report yourself. The folks at A.R.C. will never say a word about this since they are trying to protect the company's a\*\*. As with the admins, the only thing they care about now is concluding this incident ASAP so they can give the people a quick answer. They wouldn't even bother to investigate the details. If this keeps going on, it's very likely that he'll be charged with serious crimes...

**Cherry**<br>
Damnit! Why didn't Simon refute their accusations!?

**JOE**<br>
Doesn't Æsir have the ability to erase people's memories? Could that be the reason why?

**Cherry**<br>
Very possible... If that's the case, the same method that's effective on other victims should work with him too. We just need to take him to the site or show him clear footage that can remind him of the incident. That way, he'll be able to recover his memory.

**JOE**<br>
Is there any way for us to do that?

**Cherry**<br>
I've tried to apply for a visit, but the advanced restricted area gave me a giant cold shoulder... Can you do something through the Cafe's resources?

**JOE**<br>
... Yeah. There are plenty of skilled people on the Cafe's network. As long as we offer a high enough reward, we should be able to find helpers. However, the tricky thing now is that the Baro people are frankly ecstatic about Simon's arrest. There's a very good chance that they don't want him to ever come out again.

**Cherry**<br>
Diego...

**JOE**<br>
... Big sis... so you're still working under him?

**Cherry**<br>
The "Mediator" job is not affiliated with any particular organization in the first place. Our role is merely a simple underground customs. But in recent years, the influence of Baro has just grown way too fast. Almost every available resource is now under their control. The previous balance has also been... You are more aware of this than anyone else, aren't you?

**JOE**<br>
......

**JOE**<br>
I'm sorry... I don't have what it takes to carry pops' scale after all...

*\[Ringtone\]*

**Cherry**<br>
... Chris? What's up?

**[Chris]**<br>
*What do you mean "What's up"!? The rehearsal has already begun! Where are you!?*

**Cherry**<br>
... Eh? AH! It's today!?

**[LUMY]**<br>
*Give me the phone! You remember the wrong date!? You're helpless! Where the heck are you now? Get your butt over here ASAP!*

**Cherry**<br>
Gotcha! I'll get going right now! However, it may still take a while. Just sing a few songs in my place first!

**[LUMY]**<br>
*If you're paying for the celebration party.*

**Cherry**<br>
... F, FINE! I'll pay for it! Happy now!?

*\[Call Ends\]*

**Cherry**<br>
I gotta go. I remembered the wrong performance date. Oh crap, this is bad...

**JOE**<br>
Ah, right. It is today... Best of luck with your performance. I'll watch the live stream if I have free time.

**Cherry**<br>
Bye.

**JOE**<br>
Bye...

**Cherry**<br>
... Hey, don't look so depressed. Isn't having your hair look like s\*\*\* already bad enough?

**JOE**<br>
Hey hey hey! That's mean!

**Cherry**<br>
Haha...<br>
You... Don't blame yourself. We're all living in guilt for our crimes, right?

**JOE**<br>
......!<br>
...... Yeah.

*\[Doorbell\]*

**Cherry**<br>
Remember to watch the stream. I will use our songs to bring that stupid smile back onto your face. That's what suits you. Bye\~!
