**Cherry**<br>
Ummm.... this is... my home?<br>
Ah, right... JOE escorted me home...

**Punk**<br>
Meow~

**Cherry**<br>
What's the matter, Punk? You hungry? Sorry, sorry; I'll go fix you some food now~<br>
Owww...... my head hurts...

**Punk**<br>
Meow~

**Cherry**<br>
Hey! What are you eating!? You can't just eat random things! Spit it out!<br>
Hmmm...? What is this? A note?

**Cherry**<br>
"To Big sis"... Did JOE write this? Woah, his handwriting is so bad... Why did he choose to hand\-write this? Ah! Could it be that I did something stupid yesterday!?

**Cherry**<br>
......

**Cherry**<br>
...... "To Big sis, after you finish reading this note, burn it immediately. What I'm about to tell you now is the full conversation between Simon and me a while ago."

**Cherry**<br>
......!

**Cherry**<br>
... "That's more or less it. To be fair, if what Simon said was indeed true, then Big sis should already know about the Cafe and its business as well. Haha, what the hell is going on with Crystal PuNK? Why are there so many hidden identities in this band? Not to mention they are all somehow connected to one another..." 

**Cherry**<br>
...... "However, I think that we all just weren't given a chance to pick our path; or we just missed countless chances to make the right choice... TBH, I don't really know what I'm even writing now either, since I'm not someone who's good with words. I just wanted to say, I think... or hope, in the end, what truly connects us all together is still music after all."

**Cherry**<br>
...... " I feel like the CP days were the happiest, most fulfilling memories in our lives to all four of us. I really hope that I'm not the only one who thinks this way... If we can, perhaps everything still has a chance to go back to what it once was. Simply playing music, simply screwing around, simply living life, just like how we used to be back then... As long as the four of us work hard together, I never thought that anything is a "luxury"..."

**Cherry**<br>
...... "I believe that Big sis has the same wish as well. That's why I wrote this down. We all still have a chance to make the right choice. King of Germs."

**Cherry**<br>

**Cherry**<br>
Idiot... my life... has never been simple...

**Cherry**<br>

**Cherry**<br>
Idiot......
