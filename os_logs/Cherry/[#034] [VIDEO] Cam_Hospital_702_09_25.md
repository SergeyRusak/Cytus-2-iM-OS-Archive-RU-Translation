Hello, I'm here to visit Shannon Jackson.

**Nurse**<br>
Got it. You must be Miss Sherry Pauline, right? The area beyond this is the Electronic Trauma Treatment area. Please place your mobile device and all electronic accessories in this basket. You can retrieve them when you leave.

**Cherry**<br>
... Understood.

**Nurse**<br>
Walk straight until you reached the end of the hallway, then turn left. You will see ward P29\-015 there.

**Cherry**<br>
Thank you.

**Jacob**<br>
Oh, you're here.

**Cherry**<br>
... Shannon...

**Jacob**<br>
We just completed emotion\-focused therapy with her. She is in a much more stable state now. Look, she's drawing sketches of insects. She loves to draw these kinds of things in her free time.

**Cherry**<br>
... What happened to her?

**Jacob**<br>
Virtual\-Internet Related Post\-Traumatic Stress Disorder, or VR PTSD for short. If a patient happened to be connected to the cyTus internet when experiencing extreme shock and mental trauma, it will cause severe damage to the nervous system. Due to the lack of case studies, we are unable to develop an effective treatment as of now...

**Cherry**<br>
... Can I go in and see her up close?

**Jacob**<br>
I'm sorry... you can only observe her through this glass. The patient has lost all communication capabilities. In addition, any outside simulation that triggers her memory may cause her to suffer panic attacks again.

**Cherry**<br>
... *\*Sniff\**...

**Jacob**<br>
If she knows that a friend has come to visit, she will be very happy, I believe. For the past two years, she has had very few visitors besides family members.

**Cherry**<br>
So, Simon?

**Jacob**<br>
Do you know him as well? He and their mother visit her almost every week. <br>
Mr. Simon is also the only person that can somehow come in contact with her so far.

**Cherry**<br>
Eh? Didn't you say...?

**Jacob**<br>
Hmm, to be honest, it doesn't really count as "contact"... If he enters the ward without wearing that strange helmet of his, Miss Shannon will immediately enter a panic state upon seeing him as well.

**Cherry**<br>
......

**Jacob**<br>
We later discovered that "Music Treatment" is the most effective at treating the symptoms. For different patients, different genres of music can help stabilize their emotions.

**Cherry**<br>
Music Treatment...

**Jacob**<br>
In the case of Miss Shannon, guitar music played by Mr. Simon has proven to have the most significant effect. Therefore, every once in a while, he will come here to play the guitar for her. However, he can only do so while wearing the helmet. He could never tell her that he is her actual older brother; it's a bit cruel if you ask me...

**Cherry**<br>
......

**Jacob**<br>
Ah... no need to feel so depressed! We are also focusing our research on proving the relationship between music and said disorder. This research has a very good chance to provide us with the breakthrough needed to discover a treatment method.

**Cherry**<br>
... It's all my fault...

**Jacob**<br>
Miss Sherry?

**Cherry**<br>
No... nothing...

**Jacob**<br>
... Apologies, the visiting time is over. We are turning off the lights. This way, please.

**Cherry**<br>
OK...
