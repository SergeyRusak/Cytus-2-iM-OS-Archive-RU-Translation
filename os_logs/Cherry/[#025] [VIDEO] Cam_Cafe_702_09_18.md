**JOE**<br>
Yo, Simon.

**Xenon**<br>
... What's wrong with her? Is she drunk?

![chos2501.png](./attachments/chos2501.png)
**JOE**<br>
Her? Do you really think she can get drunk? She just fell asleep; apparently, band practice was tough today.<br>
Should we wake her up?

**Xenon**<br>
There's still some time, let her sleep a little longer.<br>
Milk

**JOE**<br>
Coming.<br>
On a side note, you seem a bit too free these days. Don't you have work? 

**Xenon**<br>
No, because my support of the admins some time ago got me plenty of holidays.

**JOE**<br>
Oh, I see, congrats! Then where are you guys going later?

**Xenon**<br>
Not telling you.

**JOE**<br>
Huh\~? Why are you also acting so mysterious and such? Are you guys having an underground affair?

**Xenon**<br>
How can there be an underground one when there's nothing on the surface to begin with... stop acting like an idiot.

**JOE**<br>
OK, ok. I won't delve too much into the privacy of my customers.<br>
Here, your milk.

**Xenon**<br>
... We're investigating Ã†sir's trace, and we might be on his tail now.

**JOE**<br>
Wow, you serious!? How did you guys do that?

**Xenon**<br>
Even if I do explain, there's no way that blockhead of yours gets it. To keep it short, once we get the evidence we need, we'll go get NEKO from the admins.

**JOE**<br>
Oh I see\~ Then good luck\~ Mr."Big Hero"\~<br>
But all things aside, isn't this quite dangerous? I mean if it's really him, he's pretty much a terrorist, isn't he?

**Xenon**<br>
Yeah, but someone has to do it, right? Everyone in the Node will have their brains hacked to eternity by the time those worthless admins move a muscle.

**Cherry**<br>
Mmm... how long have I been asleep?

**JOE**<br>
Around an hour... Jasus! Why are there tears all over your face!? Were you crying?

**Cherry**<br>
Umm... no, I wasn't! My contacts are too dry!

**Xenon**<br>
... Since you're awake, it's about time we get going.

**Cherry**<br>
Ah, ok... let's go!<br>
See ya JOE. I'll come for a drink next time.

**JOE**<br>
See ya, guys! Please be careful!

*\[Doorbell\]*

**Xenon**<br>
... Your makeup is a mess. Here, clean up your face.

**Cherry**<br>
Uh\-huh... I had a dream about our past together. So people really do cry when they wake up from crying in their dreams. Haha...

**Xenon**<br>
... A while ago there's someone on iM who sent a mail in their dream only to realize that they actually sent it in real life too.<br>
Put on the helmet, we'll ride my bike there.

*\[Engines On\]*

**Cherry**<br>
Wow, it's still the one I used to wear, feels nostalgic... hmm? When did it become so tight? Did you let someone else wear it?

**Xenon**<br>
Ah, probably NEKO? Sometimes when we compose late into the night, I'll give her a ride home.

**Cherry**<br>
So she really is your new...

**Xenon**<br>
Yeah Yeah\~ she is\~ now stop talking and get on.
