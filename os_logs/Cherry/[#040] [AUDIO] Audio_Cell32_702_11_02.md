**Agent A**<br>
Sherry Pauline, you have 20 minutes.

**Cherry**<br>
Thank you. Dad!

**Luis**<br>
You're here?

**Cherry**<br>
Why did you get fat again? Is the food too tasty in there?

**Luis**<br>
Not bad... As with you, you lost weight again... Are you alright?

**Cherry**<br>
Hmm? I'm alright! Everything is fine!

**Luis**<br>
Good to hear that. I watched your performance at Tower. It was great.

**Cherry**<br>
Aww, why would you do that, it's so embarrassing. Here, I brought you some fruits. You've become so fat.

**Luis**<br>
You can send this stuff in here now?

**Cherry**<br>
It seems that they got a new scanning system. As long as we clear that, it'll be fine. But it also seems that this is only available in the low\-level restricted areas.

**Luis**<br>
I see... Thank you.

**Cherry**<br>
Ah, right. They said that you might get a few more years off your sentence. Thank goodness...

**Luis**<br>
......

**Cherry**<br>
... What's wrong?

**Luis**<br>
I deserve to be in here. It was Simon who brought me back to my senses.

**Cherry**<br>
......

**Luis**<br>
You too...

**Cherry**<br>
I know... Don't talk about it anymore...

**Luis**<br>
Your band is slowly hitting the stride too. You don't need to suffer this anymore. I don't mind staying in here for a few more years.

**Cherry**<br>
......

**[TV]**<br>
*... Just earlier today, A.R.C. backend administrator Simon Jackson has been arrested in A.R.C. by law enforcement agents. Our sources show that he is none other than the biggest suspect for "Æsir", the mastermind behind the recent string of internet crime incidents.  *

**Cherry**<br>
Eh? Dad, turn up the volume!

**Luis**<br>
...... Understood!

**[TV]**<br>
*... discovered a large number of commands used by said A.I. to commit internet crimes, which even includes the infamous cyberterrorism incident during a live stream a few months ago. All this evidence are proof of Simon Jackson's highly possible association with Æsir. *

**Cherry**<br>
Simon!? How come?

**Luis**<br>
......

**[TV]**<br>
*Faced with such serious accusations, Simon Jackson did not say a single word to defend himself, nor attempted to prove his innocence...*

**Luis**<br>
Simon is Æsir...?

**Cherry**<br>
That's impossible! We even investigated this case together. Although I don't know about what happened after that...

**Luis**<br>
Wait a minute... the footage on this news report... He's in the area just next door, isn't he?

**Cherry**<br>
I'll go see him!

**Luis**<br>
Wait, the area next door is the advanced restricted area. If you didn't apply beforehand, they are not going to let you inside.

**Cherry**<br>
Even so, I'm still going! That's it for now.

**Luis**<br>
