**JOE„ÄÅKAI**<br>
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!

**Cherry**<br>
Waaah!

**KAI**<br>
Muhahaha! We got big sis to squeal like a little girl! Great Success!

**Cherry**<br>
... That scared the s\*\*\* out of me! What the hell are you guys up to?

**KAI**<br>
Simon told us that today is your birthday.

**JOE**<br>
Yeah, he said that your account ended with 0906, so he guessed that today's the day.

**Cherry**<br>
You bunch of... what if you made a mistake and messed up?

**JOE**<br>
Umm? Did we mess up?

**Cherry**<br>
... No, you didn't.<br>
That was quite the scare. Did my father know you guys are here? 

**JOE**<br>
He was the one who let us in in the first place. He kept saying "Thank you" too.<br>
Too bad he has to work, or we would have made him part of the scare.

**KAI**<br>
What's your father's job? It's odd that he leaves for work so late.

**Cherry**<br>
Um, a security guard of some sort... where's Simon?

**JOE**<br>
He said he's going to go buy some booze, but he sure is taking his sweet time. Did he run all the way to Node 03 to buy them?

**KAI**<br>
He doesn't drink though. It's going to be you and me that's doing the drinking.

**Cherry**<br>
I can drink.

**KAI**<br>
You're underage! If your dad found out about it...

**Cherry**<br>
Nah, no probs. My father always drinks with me. I might have a higher tolerance for alcohol than you two. 

**JOE**<br>
Oh? Interesting. Not many have dared to talk such trash to me, the Alcohol Master of Quadrant III.

**KAI**<br>
Well, that's all fine and dandy. But if Simon doesn't come back, we won't have anything to drink.

**Cherry**<br>
Ah, crap... I haven't practiced a single chord he told me to practice last week... what if he tests me on that later?

**JOE**<br>
Oh, right. He's teaching you the guitar.<br>
*\*Sighs\** But seriously, good looking, check. Plays Bass, check. Plays guitar, double check. On top of it all, he has a younger sister... Life ain't fair! *\*cries\**

**KAI**<br>
Really good with the computer too. That guy, he really is a winner in life...

**Cherry**<br>
Pfft! But he's not a good singer though. His singing is so damn horrible. Hahaha.

**KAI**<br>
Haha! You serious? Man, I want to hear it!
