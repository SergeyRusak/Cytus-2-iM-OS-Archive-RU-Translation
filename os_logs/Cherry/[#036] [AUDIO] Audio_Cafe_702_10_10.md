**Cherry**<br>
Hi\~ You busy?

**JOE**<br>
Big sis!? If you're coming, gimme a heads\-up! All the booths are full... sorry.

**Cherry**<br>
It's okay. I'm just here by myself. A bar seat is fine; or are you going to be distracted with me sitting here?

**JOE**<br>
Not at all! Take a seat! All my customers tonight are smelly middle\-aged men. A balance to the scenery is exactly what I need for mah eyes...

**Customer A**<br>
Huh? Your place is the only one around here that serves decent cocktails; that's the only reason why we are here. Why else would we want to taint our eyes with your sea cucumber hair!

**JOE**<br>
Haha, I'll take that as a compliment!

**Customer B**<br>
You mean the sea cucumber hair part?

**JOE**<br>
Shut it! You talk too much!<br>
Big sis, what would you like to drink?

**Cherry**<br>
I'll let you decide. I quite like the tangy drink you served me last time.

**JOE**<br>
Okay\~ The first one is on me! You always order four or five more drinks anyway.

**Customer B**<br>
Ho? Young lady, you're a good drinker too? How about a drinking match with us old folks?

**JOE**<br>
Hey, she is my friend. Keep your dicks in your pants, you perverts...

**Cherry**<br>
Sure! That seems like a lot of fun!

**JOE**<br>
Oyoy... you serious? Don't underestimate those geezers; they are the type that can really drink a lot...

**Cherry**<br>
Who cares\~ I don't have work tomorrow anyway. I planned to get 70% drunk today in the first place. The remaining 30% should be more than enough to handle these folks, right?

**Customer A**<br>
Hmph! Interesting! Hey, bring that thing out! It's on me!

**JOE**<br>
Sighs... Then don't blame me for what's gonna happen next.
