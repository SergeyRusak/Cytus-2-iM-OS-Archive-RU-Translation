Man, JOE was annoying as f\*\*\* back then...

**Cherry**<br>
Not that he isn't now though. Haha.

**Xenon**<br>
This also brings back memories of our first band practice. That was one hell of a horrific mess.

**Cherry**<br>
I know right! JOE kept hitting the wrong notes, and KAI was so pissed off that he looked like he's gonna explode any second.

**Xenon**<br>
I remember there was a slap where he failed like a dozen times. KAI simply couldn't take it and threw his drumsticks at him...

**Cherry**<br>
But then the drumsticks somehow got lodge in his hair!

**Xenon**<br>
Haha... that was an instant classic. Everyone was really mad before that, but seeing it instantly made everyone crack up.

**Cherry**<br>
Then all of a sudden, JOE just stopped messing up. After that, every time when JOE was struggling during practice, KAI would stick a drumstick in his hair. God that was hilarious, hahaha!

**Xenon**<br>
Haha. Yeah, that was so dumb.

**Cherry**<br>
Did you remember the time when he was drunk? He stuck his hair full of drumsticks and started running around on the streets, What was he yelling...

**Cherry&Xenon**<br>
"I'm the King of Germs!!"

**Xenon**<br>
Haha! For someone who's so terrible with alcohol, it's quite ballsy of him to open up a bar.

*\[Door Opens\]*

**JOE**<br>
I can hear that! Simon, your milk. Cherry, Long Island.

**Cherry**<br>
Hi, King of Germs.

**JOE**<br>
Shut it! Aren't you guys here to talk about something? Is that what you guys want to talk about?

**Cherry**<br>
It's a lot of fun talking about it.<br>
Everyone was pretty drunk that day, except Simon who didn't drink. He was the only one awake.

**Xenon**<br>
I remember that it was eight years ago this exact day. It was your birthday.

**Cherry**<br>
Haha... so you still remember.

**JOE**<br>
Oh oh! Right! Today's your birthday! Happy birthday! I'll treat you a special cocktail later.

**Cherry**<br>
Thanks

**JOE**<br>
Haha, I recall that Simon prepared a super amusing present for you that day.

**JOE**<br>
Ah, got customers. You guys can go on.
