**Cherry**<br>
When did you move here?

**Xenon**<br>
I didn't. I now live on the A.R.C. This is a workshop that I'll occasionally use when I'm on a holiday.

*\[Kicks Can\]*

**Cherry**<br>
Yikes! I think I just kicked something?

**Xenon**<br>
*\*Sighs\**... Sorry, it's quite messy in here. I'll clean it up a bit so you can have a place to sit.

**Cherry**<br>
Huh, it's so unlike you to leave a room in such a sloppy condition.

**Xenon**<br>
It's not me. This is the handiwork of that brat.

**Cherry**<br>
... NEKO? You guys are a lot closer than I thought. From what I remember, you were the type of people who would get really mad when someone else touches your equipment.

**Xenon**<br>
... Whatever you say. I won't bother to explain anymore. I only treat her like a little sister.

**Cherry**<br>
Little sister... about that, how's Shannon doing?

**Xenon**<br>
... I don't want to talk about that.<br>
No more chit\-chat. Did you bring the information?

**Cherry**<br>
Oh... yeah, it's all here.

**Xenon**<br>
Why is it that your handwriting STILL looks like it's written by an elementary student? You should write more often. How am I suppose to understand this stuff...?

**Cherry**<br>
N, none of your business! If you want to whine then give it back!

**Xenon**<br>
I was just kidding, I can read it just fine.<br>
... He really contacted you this many times?

**Cherry**<br>
Yes, but each time, it's just a brief conversation to tell me something regarding the event. I've never heard him talk too. We only communicated through text.<br>
I can't remember the exact time on some of them, sorry...

**Xenon**<br>
It's okay. With this sample size, I'm fairly certain that I can rewind and find the signal source.

**Xenon**<br>
Give me a minute. I'll go and get something inside.

**Cherry**<br>
