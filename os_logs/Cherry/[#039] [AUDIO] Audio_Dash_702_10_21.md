**Hunter**<br>
Capo.

**Angus**<br>
Too late. You got the balls to let me wait now? You want my fist in your face that badly?

**Hunter**<br>
Okay, okay... She's not here either, isn't she?

**Angus**<br>
She said she has an event and will be running late.

**Hunter**<br>
What's this discrimination towards me compare to the hot girl...

**Angus**<br>
What did you say!?

**Hunter**<br>
Nothing... So "Puppets" this time as well?

**Angus**<br>
Yes. We're using the "tunnels". That's why we need her.

**Hunter**<br>
Say, do we really need this "Mediator" role anymore...? We've done this for years. I feel like we can handle this ourselves just fine.

**Angus**<br>
Nobody understands the structure of the tunnels better than her. As long as we have her, we can smuggle stuff through that area with no troubles. Besides, business is getting harder and harder these days. Better be safe than sorry.

**Hunter**<br>
Eh? How so?

**Angus**<br>
I heard this from the folks in the information department. First, our mole in the Administration Bureau has been getting less and less effective. Second, recently, the A.R.C. people seem to be continuously tracking our internet activities.

**Hunter**<br>
Ah, that incident... Didn't Boss ask her to handle this issue already?

**Angus**<br>
From the looks of it, it wasn't handled well. I'll ask her when we meet up later. One of our old customers got busted a few days ago. You knew that, right?

**Hunter**<br>
You mean that lolicon bastard? Yeah. I even personally carried out several of his orders. I was freaking the f\*\*\* out. Thank goodness that the investigation wasn't traced back to us.

**Angus**<br>
Yes. Although still uncertain whether it's related to this incident or not, right now, Boss is suspecting that someone within the gang leaked the information.

**Hunter**<br>
Isn't it easier to just tell the Cafe to investigate?

**Angus**<br>
You mean JOE? He appears to be one of the people Boss is suspecting.

**Hunter**<br>
HA! That s\*\*\*head has that kind of balls?

**Angus**<br>
All in all, we'll let Boss handle this case. As long as it doesn't affect us, we should still be able to run this business safely for a while. To avoid suspicion, you best not go off the tracks and do something stupid these days.

**Hunter**<br>
Okay, okay...

*\[Footsteps\]*

**Cherry**<br>
Sorry for coming late.

**Angus**<br>
... Get in the car. We'll talk in the car.

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Cherry**<br>
Here's the route layout for this time. It appears that the admins reprogrammed the drones in this area to give them a different set of actions and movement patterns. You guys better memorize all this first.

**Hunter**<br>
So annoying...

**Cherry**<br>
This model of drones requires the P30 to penetrate. Can you find a way to get at least one before this transaction?

**Angus**<br>
Not a problem. I can get three.

**Hunter**<br>
With big sis here, one for her is plenty enough if you ask me...

**Cherry**<br>
Don't call me big sis...

**Angus**<br>
Is there anything else we must pay attention to?

**Cherry**<br>
Not much. The route we picked this time is very old. The surveillance cameras have all stopped functioning already, so it's relatively simple.

**Angus**<br>
Thanks for the hard work. We'll let you off here. We'll contact you on that day.

**Cherry**<br>
Sure...

**Angus**<br>
Ah, right. Regarding that thing they called you last time for, are you dealing with it right now?

**Cherry**<br>
... I couldn't get in contact with him... Besides, he stopped investigating you guys recently, right?

**Angus**<br>
No idea. The information department is the one that reported this. I'm just responsible for passing on Boss's message.

**Cherry**<br>
......

**Angus**<br>
However, I advise you to be careful. They said that our mole in the Administration Bureau is on the hot seat now. If they slip up even one bit, they could be in trouble. That guy... he's your ex\-boyfriend, right?

**Cherry**<br>
......

**Hunter**<br>
If anything happens, Boss is gonna get it fixed anyway.

**Cherry**<br>
... Anything else?

**Angus**<br>
Oh, one more thing from Boss. He said that he has been trying his best regarding your dad's case. If he's lucky, he might get a few more years off his sentence.

**Cherry**<br>
...... Understood.
