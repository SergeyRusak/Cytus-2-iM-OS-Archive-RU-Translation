**S.J.**<br>
Haha, it's fine.<br>
*[Sent at PM 09:22]*

**S.J.**<br>
I've also heard your DEMO. I'm quite interested. The lead singer's voice is very nice.<br>
*[Sent at PM 09:22]*

**JOE**<br>
XD She wrote most of it. I wrote a little bit\~<br>
*[Sent at PM 09:22]*

**Cherry**<br>
Thank you. I did indeed write most of it<br>

**KAI**<br>
Jesus you guys are making it sound like I'm doing nothing...<br>
*[Sent at PM 09:22]*

**S.J.**<br>
Haha, but I quite like this method of composition. By starting with the main melody, the emotions are very much on point.
For your first song, I made a new chord for it. Give it a listen.<br>

OMG!! It's amazing!! Let's make this the final ver\~<br>

**KAI**<br>
Very nice. You can come to our band practice this weekend. Big sis, set up the practice room will you. <br>
*[Sent at PM 09:25]*

**Cherry**<br>
Why are you grown\-a\*\* men calling me big sis? I'm the youngest here!<br>
*[Sent at PM 09:25]*

**JOE**<br>
You sure? Simon's only 17<br>
*[Sent at PM 09:25]*

**Cherry**<br>
Thy fair lady here is only 16<br>
*[Sent at PM 09:25]*

**KAI**<br>
Thy fair lady... you sound like a big sis saying that...<br>
*[Sent at PM 09:25]*

**Cherry**<br>
Stop yapping. I'm done setting up the virtual space in Area 3<br>
*[Sent at PM 09:27]*

**S.J.**<br>
Umm, sorry for bothering, but can we use a physical space for practice? I'm more used to analog resonance.<br>
*[Sent at PM 09:27]*

**Cherry**<br>
I'm ok with it, but I've never used a physical space before<br>
*[Sent at PM 09:27]*

**JOE**<br>
Me neither\~ Won't there be a bunch of problems with feedback and stuff?<br>

**S.J.**<br>
Yeah, but I assume that the band will have plenty of opportunities to perform in a physical space in the future. It's best that everyone learned to deal with different situations when they come up.<br>
*[Sent at PM 09:28]*

**KAI**<br>
You have a point. Looks like we have a new band leader XD
I'll book a practice room. My friend's instrument store has access to physical spaces.<br>
*[Sent at PM 09:28]*

**S.J.**<br>
Thank you. Sorry for bothering everyone. 
I look forward to seeing everyone.<br>
