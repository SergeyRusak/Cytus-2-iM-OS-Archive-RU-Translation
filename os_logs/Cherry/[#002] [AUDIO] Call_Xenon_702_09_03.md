**Xenon**<br>
Hello.

**Cherry**<br>
... Hi. So you still have my number.

**Xenon**<br>
You said you had something important to tell me. What is it?

**Cherry**<br>
Haha, your voice hasn't changed at all.

**Xenon**<br>
... If you just want to chit\-chat, I'm hanging up.

**Cherry**<br>
Sorry... I really do have something important to tell you! Not just about us two...<br>
I felt that this has something to do with your work, and I should tell you about it.

**Xenon**<br>
Then stop beating around the bush.

**Cherry**<br>
The details might get lost in the call. On top of that, I don't think we should talk about this on the internet. If you have the time, can we schedule a meetup...?

**Xenon**<br>
.......

**Cherry**<br>
You're... still mad at me, aren't you?

**Xenon**<br>
... I don't know.<br>
So many years have passed. I can now understand the situation you were in back then, and I don't really have that strong of a feeling anymore. However, now that you mentioned it all of a sudden... I don't know.

**Cherry**<br>
Back then, I never had the opportunity to properly apologize, or properly thank you...... I never expected you to forgive me, but at least listen to what I have to say...

**Xenon**<br>
... You're somewhat of a celebrity now. Is it really ok for you to meet up with me?

**Cherry**<br>
I'll disguise a little bit. Let's meet up at Joe's. It's quieter there.

**Xenon**<br>
*\*Sighs\**... Alright, can't hurt. I'll be there this weekend at night. 

**Cherry**<br>
Thanks. See you then.

**Xenon**<br>
See you.
