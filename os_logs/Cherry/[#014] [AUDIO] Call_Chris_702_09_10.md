**Chris**<br>
Hello. This is Monophonic Entertainment. I'm Chris. How may I help you?

**Cherry**<br>
It's me.

**Chris**<br>
Huh, Cherry? Why are you using this unknown number? What's the matter?

**Cherry**<br>
I got the notice. What's the deal with that event on the 15th? It's not on our schedule before!

**Chris**<br>
Ahhh, that one. PAFF was supposed to attend that event, but as you may know she's kind of... Therefore, the agency arranged you guys to go and save the day.

**Cherry**<br>
What the hell? When did we agree to this?

**Chris**<br>
I asked the Keyboard. He said that the members are all OK with it.

**Cherry**<br>
... I have things to deal with that day. I can't make it.

**Chris**<br>
Don't be stubborn. This is an event big enough to get PAFF! You guys just started, this is a prime opportunity for media exposure. Cases like this don't come by that easily, so don't make it difficult for us.

**Cherry**<br>
Is PAFF really in such a terrible condition that she couldn't be on stage? I saw her a while ago at the office; she looked just fine...

**Chris**<br>
Umm...  not quite her physical condition, more like she just completely disappeared to nowhere. The higher\-ups are in full\-on panic mode now.

**Cherry**<br>
Huh?? Completely disappeared? What the hell is that supposed to mean? Does Sis Helena know anything?

**Chris**<br>
Ah crap... no, nothing, just some rumors I heard. This is all top secret stuff, so don't spill the beans! <br>
All in all, the performance is already scheduled. The company hosting the event is also very open to the switch to you guys, so you better be there!

**Cherry**<br>
... Understood. Bye.
