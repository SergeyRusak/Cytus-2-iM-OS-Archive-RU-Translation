**Cherry**<br>
See, I'm still wearing it, the necklace.

**Xenon**<br>
It looks so out of place with the outfit you are currently wearing...

**Cherry**<br>
That's why I've hidden it inside.<br>
*\*Sigh\**... The time with Crystal\_PuNK is undoubtedly the happiest time in my life.<br>
What a pity that it disbanded. 

**Xenon**<br>
Yeah, that's also the happiest time in my life.

**Cherry**<br>
... Will there ever be a chance that we can go back to it?

**Xenon**<br>
I don't see it. Everyone has their own life now. JOE hasn't played in a while. I've never seen KAI again after we disbanded. You have your own band now and it's quite successful too.

**Cherry**<br>
I was talking about us two...

**Xenon**<br>
......

**Cherry**<br>
Ah... sorry. That's not what I want to talk with you about... what's wrong with me?<br>
I actually contacted you because I want to talk to you about Æsir\-FEST.

**Xenon**<br>
Huh? What happened?

**Cherry**<br>
You know that I was one of the invited performers for that event, right?<br>
The stuff revealed on the internet a while ago has allowed me to recall some details... I think I've come in contact with him on the internet before the performance.<br>
There have been a string of terrorist attacks on the internet. I was wondering if he has anything to do with it; that's why I contacted you.

**Xenon**<br>
Seriously? Do you still have the conversation records?

**Cherry**<br>
When I went back, the records were deleted. However, I still remember the dates.

**Xenon**<br>
Nice! Give me the specific date and location. I should be able to rewind and track down the source location of the signal.

**Cherry**<br>
... So you're really investigating this person?

**Xenon**<br>
Yes, I have a friend. I feel that she was attacked by Æsir, but the administration bureau believes she was the one responsible for that large\-scale attack... She is currently in custody for investigation. I need to help her. 

**Cherry**<br>
I supposed you're talking about that streamer?

**Xenon**<br>
Yes.

**Cherry**<br>
... New girlfriend?

**Xenon**<br>
... No. Just a collab partner.

**Cherry**<br>
Haha... All in all, I get you the specific time and location, you'll figure out a way to do something with them, am I right?

**Xenon**<br>
Yes. It would really help if you can recall all the details.<br>
However, don't contact me via the internet for this case. I need to investigate in the real world. <br>
The admins are watching me quite closely these days. It seems that they are trying to hide something from me.

**Cherry**<br>
Are you... tangled up in some kind of really troublesome case?

**Xenon**<br>
... Maybe we are all tangled up in this already.

**Cherry**<br>
... What do you mean?

**Xenon**<br>
Nothing... Whatever happens, I would not allow anything dangerous to happen to those around me.

**Cherry**<br>
Whether it's dangerous or not, let me help you. Take it as a small compensation for what I have done...

**Xenon**<br>
...Ok.
