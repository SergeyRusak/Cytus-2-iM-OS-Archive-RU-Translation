**Xenon**<br>
We're here.

**Cherry**<br>
We don't need to use the transceivers here?

**Xenon**<br>
There's no one here, no need for that. On top of that, I can pretty much guess where you were standing at the time...

**Cherry**<br>
Yeah, it's right there.

**Xenon**<br>
So you really do come here by yourself for no reason...?

**Cherry**<br>
Yes. I come here to repent myself for leaving without ever saying "Sorry" to you...

**Xenon**<br>
Here's all the evidence. Is this the "secret" that you've been unable to tell me all this time...?

**Cherry**<br>
I...

**Xenon**<br>
... I should have let him die...

**Cherry**<br>
Simon... I really don't know about this...

**Xenon**<br>
You've been helping him all this time, right?

**Cherry**<br>
We... this is the only way for us to live...

**Xenon**<br>
He's a murderer!!

**Cherry**<br>
HE'S MY FATHER!!

**Xenon**<br>
... Even if he is, he is just a criminal to me now. For the things that he has done... I will not allow him to escape the law!

**Cherry**<br>
... Then what about me? Am I also just a criminal to you now?

**Xenon**<br>
......

**Cherry**<br>
You can't accept this, can you? The real me...

**Xenon**<br>
......!<br>
... I don't...
