**Cherry**<br>
This is S. I'm in.

**[Rald]**<br>
*I see your position on the map now. Turn right at the next intersection. Open the second door. You'll see a LE\-113A drone inside.*

*\[Gunshot\]*

**[Rald]**<br>
*Nice shot. I expect no less for someone hired by the Cafe.*

**Cherry**<br>
Having such a detailed understanding of the underground passages in the restricted area, you're not too bad yourself either.

**[Rald]**<br>
*\*Chuckles\* I appreciate your comments.*

**Cherry**<br>
Will we really reach Simon's cell by going down this way?

**[Rald]**<br>
*No need to worry, trust me. Later, there will be a brief moment with no signal. Therefore, you'll need to follow my instructions.*

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

**Cherry**<br>
... I'm curious. If you know the topography down here so well, why hire a gunman? Why don't you just do it yourself?

**[Rald]**<br>
*Hmm... Perhaps I'm currently in a situation where I can't quite move around easily, or perhaps I feel like things are more interesting this way. Who knows?*

**Cherry**<br>
......

**[Rald]**<br>
*Isn't this great for you though? Don't you want to save him yourself? Miss Pauline?*

**Cherry**<br>
......!? How did you know my name?<br>
Hey? Hello...?

**[Rald]**<br>
*[Signal Lost]*

**Cherry**<br>
... Damnit, signal lost.

*\[Hurried Footsteps\]*

**Cherry**<br>
This is it. Password lock... Simon, I'll be there in a minute.

*\[Alarm\]*

**Cherry**<br>
......!?

**[Control System]**<br>
*Decision: Incorrect password. Defense system activate. Deploy model LE\-113C security drones to perform full area scan. Law enforcement agents, please leave this area as soon as possible.*

**Cherry**<br>
The password is incorrect!?

**[Control System]**<br>
*Model LE\-113C security drones, deploy start.*

**Cherry**<br>
... We're tricked.

*[→Signal Switch]*

**[Drone]**<br>
*Target acquired. Initiate termination process immediately.*

*\[Hurried Footsteps\]*

**Cherry**<br>
S\*\*\*! It's a dead end!

**[Drone]**<br>
*Target acquired. Initiate termination process immediately.*

**Cherry**<br>
Tch...

**[Rald]**<br>
*This is R. Woah, looks like it's quite the spectacle on your side of things.*

**Cherry**<br>
You bastard! How dare you trick me! Where the f\*\*\* am I at right now!?

**[Rald]**<br>
*No need to worry. I've already opened Simon's cell door. However, it seems like he doesn't really want to come out.*

**[Xenon]**<br>
*Sherry!? What are you doing here?*

**Cherry**<br>
......!

**[Rald]**<br>
*As you just saw, your dear friends are literally risking their lives for you. All in all, I will leave the door open for you, the door to end this entire fiasco. The rest is up to you.<br>
Feels like your dear friends are in a pretty serious pinch. Allow me to take my leave first.*

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

*\[Explosion\]*

**Cherry**<br>
WAAA!?

*\[Gunshot\]*

**ConneR**<br>
Thanks for the hard work, Miss Pauline.

**ConneR**<br>
All clear. Let's go. The operation is over.

**Cherry**<br>
You...!

**ConneR**<br>
Yikes... K270? So you held on for so long using that piece of junk? Impressive, I should give you some bonus payment.

**Cherry**<br>
... The agents back there, as well as the password... You used us!

*\[Things crashing\]*

**ConneR**<br>
First, I "hired" you folks. Not quite "used".<br>
Second, From start to finish, I never mentioned anything about you meeting Simon. Seems like it's just your own misunderstanding.

**Cherry**<br>
......

**ConneR**<br>
Thanks to you folks, I was able to move around easily... Both you and the Cafe's successor have outperformed my expectations significantly. Praiseworthy indeed.<br>
Third, when pointing the K270 at someone, don't do it from the front...

*\[Dismantles gun\]*

**Cherry**<br>
......!

**ConneR**<br>
This toy crumbles with the slightest touch.

**Cherry**<br>
You... just who exactly are you? Why are you saving Simon? If you're trying to harm him...

**ConneR**<br>
Not the smartest question, young lady.<br>
If I want to cause him harm, I would've already dragged him out of there. I wouldn't leave him in there to make a "choice". This choice is essential in determining whether or not he is qualified to be my comrade.

**Cherry**<br>
......?

**[Drone]**<br>
*Target acquired. Initiate termination process immediately.*

**ConneR**<br>
Chit\-chat time over. You don't have that worthless gun anymore. Follow me if you don't want to die. We still got one more person to rescue.

*[Signal Lost]*
