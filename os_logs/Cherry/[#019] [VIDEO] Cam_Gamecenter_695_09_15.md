UGHH!!<br>

**Cherry**<br>
Yeah! Muhahaha! You owe me a drink, loser!

**JOE**<br>
Impossible... me, the Quadrant III gunslinger god, loses to a girl...

**Cherry**<br>
Never look down on a lady\~<br>
How 'bout you KAI? Want a match?

**KAI**<br>
I'm not really interested in this kind of game. I'm gonna go play DrumPsycho.

**Cherry**<br>
Tch, coward.<br>
Simon, you in? Wanna avenge your fellow male comrade?

**Xenon**<br>
Sure. Just a heads up though, I'm pretty confident when it comes to this game. 

**JOE**<br>
YEAH! Get her!

**Cherry**<br>
Interesting! Bring it on!

**[Arcade Shooter]**<br>
*Time Over! Player1 Cherry WIN!*

**Cherry**<br>
*\*Huff\**... *\*Puff\**...

**JOE**<br>
I... is this what a match between the pros looks like? I have absolutely no idea what the hell you guys are doing...

**Xenon**<br>
Ah\~\~, I lost. Haven't played in a while, needs more practice. 

**Cherry**<br>
Doesn't count! The time was up and I didn't get to kill you!

**Xenon**<br>
You had a little bit more HP than I did, so you won.

**Cherry**<br>
I don't care, that doesn't count! Also, you went easy on me, didn't you? I demand a rematch!

**Xenon**<br>
I didn't... also I'm exhausted. I'll treat you tomorrow; is that ok with you?

**Cherry**<br>
I don't want a victory like this! I want to properly kill you!

**JOE**<br>
Or you can have a rematch with the new and reborn gunslinger god...

**Xenon**<br>
It's getting late. We should go home. I'll go get KAI and Shannon.

**JOE**<br>
Jasus! It's almost 12 a.m. now? Oh no, my mom's gonna shave all my hair off...

**Xenon**<br>
......

**Cherry**<br>
......

**Xenon**<br>
... Are you mad?

**Cherry**<br>
... No.

**Xenon**<br>
*\*Sighs\**... Here. This is for you. Now stop being mad.

**Cherry**<br>
Hm? Wow! You got it from the crane game!?

**Xenon**<br>
Yeah. I saw you struggling at the machine for quite a while. So I decided to give it a shot.

**Cherry**<br>
Thank you! Wow! It's super cute!

**Xenon**<br>
Put it away before JOE and the others come back. Or you're gonna get mocked again.

**Cherry**<br>
Hmm... wait a second. How many attempts did you use to get this?

**Xenon**<br>
Um, one.

**Cherry**<br>
WHAT!? I'm going to challenge again! Damnit!

**Xenon**<br>
... *\*Sighs\**.
