**Cherry**<br>
Hi! Long time no see, Joe.<br>
Damn, you still recognize me through all this disguise.

**JOE**<br>
Long time indeed! What brought you guys together again? Are you...? Simon you sneaky little playboy.

**Xenon**<br>
Idiot. We're just here to talk. Get us a booth.

**Cherry**<br>
... Haha, so you got a new girlfriend?

**Xenon**<br>
Don't listen to the BS he's spilling...

**JOE**<br>
Here, you guys can have the innermost booth. What would you like to drink?

**Xenon**<br>
The usual.

**Cherry**<br>
Long Island. Thank you.<br>
Hmm, you look much more handsome with your hair tied up like that. We can talk more about it later.

**JOE**<br>
Haha, of course!

*\[Door Closes\]*

**Cherry**<br>
*\*Chuckles\**  Nothing has changed. Good to see that. 

**Xenon**<br>
Yeah. Besides that mess of hair, he's as noisy as he ever was.

**Cherry**<br>
I'm talking about you. You look exactly the same as you were six years ago.

**Xenon**<br>
...Yeah. Probably because I've been working in air\-conditioned rooms. It probably slowed my metabolism.

**Cherry**<br>
We three getting together just like the old days. Man, I miss those times.

**Xenon**<br>
... Yes, I do too. However, that's all in the past now. 

**Cherry**<br>
I was fiddling around iM the other day, and I came across our chatting records. Wanna take a look?
