**[Xenon-A.I.]**<br>
*Rewind complete. Communication records that match criteria: 1.*

**Xenon**<br>
Nailed it. Tracked down several scattered coordinates, all in Quadrant I.

**Cherry**<br>
How many times do we have to repeat this process?

**Xenon**<br>
The coordinates are a lot less scattered than I imagined. Looks like our target only operates in certain areas. Might get it within two or three more tries.<br>
We need to visit the next location on the 18th at 09:00 p.m. The next location is... *\*Sighs\**... why did it have to be here?

**Cherry**<br>
Where?

**Xenon**<br>
The river bank where we broke up...

**Cherry**<br>
Ah... I visit there from time to time when I'm by myself.

**Xenon**<br>
......

**Cherry**<br>
Hey, Ummm... even though I don't really understand this stuff, but I suppose what you're tracking now was where he contacted me last year, right?

**Xenon**<br>
Yeah, but it's still better than no clue at all.<br>
My A.I. is also investigating the current location of the hooded female suspect. If we visit the locations where she might show up at the same time, we may discover more things. 

**Cherry**<br>
So you're finally using "we"? I guess I'm now a part of this as well? Investigation team member code 01, Sherry Pauline, reporting for duty!

**Xenon**<br>
... Same as usual. Stay cautious.

**Cherry**<br>
Yes, sir! Captain Xenon!

**Xenon**<br>
Do you still have time to goof around like this? It's 5 minutes to 3 now.

**Cherry**<br>
EHH!? Well, gotta go. Chris is going to be soooo mad.

**Xenon**<br>
You can keep the transceiver. Without disruption, it should be able to receive signals from a radius of 10 km. Use this for contact.

**Cherry**<br>
Yes, sir! Captain Xenon!

**Xenon**<br>
OK, OK, I get it. The pedestrians are staring at you, so get going.
