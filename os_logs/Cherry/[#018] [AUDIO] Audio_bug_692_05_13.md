**Luis**<br>
No good. Try again.

**Cherry**<br>
......

*\[Gunshot\]*

**Luis**<br>
Your shoulders are too stiff. You're going to injure yourself like this. Try again.

**Cherry**<br>
......

**Cherry**<br>
... Father, do I have to practice this?

**Luis**<br>
We're staying at a pretty dangerous place this time. The security robots might also be a model I'm unfamiliar with. You need to learn to protect yourself.<br>
If it's too hard, how about we take a break and continue afterwards?

**Cherry**<br>
No, it's okay... I don't want to be a burden to you.

*\[Gunshot\]*

**Luis**<br>
Still no good. Take a break, you're tired. Here, have some water.

**Cherry**<br>
Thank you... and sorry.

**Luis**<br>
Silly child, what's there to be sorry about? You just started. When you began learning the guitar, you didn't get the hang of it on day 1 either, right?

**Cherry**<br>
Yeah...

**Luis**<br>
... Daddy should be the one saying sorry. I'm the one at fault for making you have to live this kind of life...

**Cherry**<br>
I told you to stop bringing that up. We can't do anything about it... This is our way of life.

**Luis**<br>
......

**Cherry**<br>
Also, stop calling yourself "daddy". It's so... childish. I'm 15 years old already.

**Luis**<br>
... You're all grown up now. Feels kinda lonely, haha... understood.

*\[Gunshot\]*

**Cherry**<br>
I got it!

**Luis**<br>
Oh! Great! Remember the feeling you have right now. Flex your diaphragm to slow down your breathing, and fire when you exhale.
