Hi when does the Cafe open?<br>
*[Sent at AM 09:58]*

**JOE**<br>
8, you coming for a drink?<br>
*[Sent at AM 10:01]*

**Cherry**<br>
Band practice ends at 5. Have a meeting with Simon at 8
No place to go, so I want to see if I can wait for him at your place<br>
*[Sent at AM 10:01]*

**JOE**<br>
OH Sure! Then I'll be in the shop at 5. You can just cone in<br>
*[Sent at AM 10:02]*

**Cherry**<br>
'Come'' in<br>
*[Sent at AM 10:02]*

**JOE**<br>
Stop nitpicking my spelling mistakes. What, are you Simon now XDDD<br>
*[Sent at AM 10:02]*

**JOE**<br>
By the way, did you guys get back together?
Why are you guys contacting each other so often recently?<br>
*[Sent at AM 10:02]*

**Cherry**<br>
No, we didn't
 Some things happened. It's complicated...<br>
*[Sent at AM 10:05]*

**Cherry**<br>
I'd ask another question, are Simon and NEKO really not dating or anything?<br>
*[Sent at AM 10:07]*

**JOE**<br>
I don't think so. He said their age is too far apart. He treats her like a little sister<br>
*[Sent at AM 10:07]*

**Cherry**<br>
So like Shannon...<br>
*[Sent at AM 10:07]*

**Cherry**<br>
Have you talked to him about it? How his sister is doing and stuff<br>
*[Sent at AM 10:07]*

**JOE**<br>
Nope. He never allowed me to even mention his sister. Every time I bring it up, he gives me this look with ''SHUT UP'' written all over it<br>

**Cherry**<br>
I see. I'm almost leaving. I'll talk about the rest at your place<br>
*[Sent at AM 10:08]*

**JOE**<br>
Got it. I'll be waiting in the shop<br>
*[Sent at AM 10:08]*

**Cherry**<br>
Just a heads up, don't get wasted by me before your customers show up, 
Alcohol Master~<br>
