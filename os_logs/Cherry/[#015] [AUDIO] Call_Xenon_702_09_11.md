**Cherry**<br>
Hello, it's me.

**Xenon**<br>
Sherry? Did you change your number?

**Cherry**<br>
Yes, this is a friend's spare number. It's more secure this way.

**Xenon**<br>
OK. What's wrong?

**Cherry**<br>
Umm... about that meeting on the 15th, I might not be able to make it... agency wants me to replace PAFF at an event she can't attend. I only just received the notice. 

**Xenon**<br>
Is PAFF's condition really that severe?

**Cherry**<br>
You darn cream Puff, all you do is care about her first... Ah, then I have some big news to tell you.

**Xenon**<br>
What news?

**Cherry**<br>
Although it's a slip of the tongue by my agent, it appears that PAFF has been missing recently.

**Xenon**<br>
Missing!? What on earth happened?

**Cherry**<br>
Yeah, it seems like Sis Helena can't find her either.

**Xenon**<br>
... My instincts tell me that PAFF's incident might have something to do with the case I'm investigating right now.

**Cherry**<br>
How so?

**Xenon**<br>
PAFF began canceling her official events since she collapsed on stage during her 7th\-anniversary concert. She hasn't even shown up in public since that event. When she collapsed, she was performing the very song she performed on Æsir\-FEST. PAFF herself has experienced memory loss in her past, which leads me to believe that the memory alteration caused by the Æsir event could have particularly severe effects on her. 

**Cherry**<br>
... Your speculation makes so much sense that it could make the news if you post it on the internet.

**Xenon**<br>
The internet is too chaotic. My identity doesn't allow me to post stuff like this. Before I figure out the truth behind all this, I would not do anything.

**Cherry**<br>
Sounds just like you.

**Xenon**<br>
In short, don't force yourself to come. I'll investigate on my own. If I made any progress, I'll inform you. <br>
Also, if it's possible, inform me if you know anything new about PAFF's situation.

**Cherry**<br>
Ok, ok. See ya you cream Puff.

**Xenon**<br>
... Is this a thing? Why's everyone using this term?
