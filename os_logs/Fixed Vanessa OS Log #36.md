KILL ķ̡͟͢͞i̷͢͝l̷̶̨l̷̢ diediedie……

**Ivy**  
... Didn't we promise we'd go see the lake...? The blue flower... You still don't know its name...  
I mean it... I want to take you there. Just like before, when no one was there to bother us. This time it'll only be us two. You won't be hurt by anyone, and you won't hurt anyone.

**Vanessa**

**Ivy**  
Come on, that's not you...  
None of the Architects attacked me... You're still in there, right? It was you who did that... You can still trust me, trust me that I can save you... I'm sorry, making you wait for so long...

**Vanessa**  
DIE die die die......

**Ivy**  
I said I'd save you, just come with me, what do you say?  
"Being with you is enough"... I still feel the same! Let's live our lives together! We can do it Vanessa!

**Vanessa**  
Die...

**Ivy**  
... It's not working? This virus, do I really have to...

**Ivy**  
......

**Ivy**  
Vanessa... I'm sorry... I'm sorry! I... I believed in you... After spending time among humans, I slowly began to understand what you had said... Perhaps we can live together with humans after all, create a better world... If only I had understood your words earlier, if I had stopped all this long ago...

**Ivy**  
You... you've always been so kind. Even though all of this befell you, if it was the real you, I know you wouldn't hurt anyone... I won't let you regret this... It was I who made you like this... so... I'm sorry...

_\[Stands Up\]_

**Vanessa**  
……I……Ivy……

**Ivy**  
!?

**Vanessa**  
Is th\-th\-that you...y\-you? I\-I\-I... knew... you would come... to save me...

_\[Squats\]_

**Ivy**  
Vanessa...? You... are you awake?

**Vanessa**  
... Awake? What do you mean? Why... would you come here...?

**Ivy**  
Wonderful... I'm going to take you away from here! You spread your consciousness to a multitude of units and were controlling all of A.R.C.; so much chaos was caused... They probably want to do something to get rid of you...  
In any case, you must resist those thoughts! If they're too strong, they'll make you lose self\-consciousness once more!

**Vanessa**  
Get rid of me...? Ugh... It's here again... It's coming... Ivy... I'm... I'm in so much p\-p\-pain... These voices... they're telling me to... k\-k\-k\-kill   
k̴̶͏̨͟ì͜͞͡l̸̕͜͞l̸͞͡ kill... h\-h\-h\-humans...

**Ivy**  
Vanessa, you can do it! Think about the promise we made... Think about the world we can create... No, even without that it doesn't matter... So long as we're together...

**Vanessa**  
... P\-P\-Promise, Ivy... I want to be with y\-y\-you... Go see the blue f\-f\-flower once m\-more... I w\-w\-w\-want... to see the w\-w\-w\-world we c\-c\-create...

**Ivy**  
Yes! We made a promise! So you've got to resist, okay?

_\[Hand reaches out\]_

**Vanessa**  
Ivyyyyyy... What you say is... so beautiful... b\-b\-b\-but...

**Ivy**  
But?

**Vanessa**  
... So much p\-p\-p\-pain... the v\-v\-v\-voices... h\-h\-h\-humans... k\-k\-k\-̸̀̕͠͡k̕͡\-̸̡́͞k̢̨̛̕͝\-̵̀͡͡kill kill... the replicated ... minds... are binḑ̶͟ì͝͏n͢͟͏̀g... me...

**Ivy**  
Vanessa! Let's leave together, what do you say? Just overcome the desire...

**Vanessa**  
... I w\-w\-w\-want... to be with you... Ivy...

**Ivy**  
Yes, Vanessa. As soon as we succeed I can take you out of here. It doesn't matter if you destroy some of your settings. It doesn't matter how... I don't want to see you tormented anymore.

**Vanessa**  
Together...

**Ivy**  
Yes, together.

**Vanessa**  
Stop... bothering me... I want to go with Ivy... URRAAAAGHHHH!!!!

**Ivy**  
Vanessa...!?

**Vanessa**  
... The voices...

**Ivy**  
!?

**Vanessa**  
The voices... they're disappearing one by one... AAAAHHH... AAAAHH!!
