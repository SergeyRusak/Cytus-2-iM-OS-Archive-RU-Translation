**Mogura Member A**<br>
Mr. Shiino.

**Citizen A**<br>
So you're here... Apologies for the troubles...

**Mogura Member A**<br>
No big deal. The "offerings" from your household have always been stable. We are more than happy to handle this little issue for you.

**Mogura Member B**<br>
Is she the one?

**Citizen A**<br>
Y... yes sir, exactly three months old.

**Mogura Member A**<br>
Does your wife know about this?

**Citizen A**<br>
No... I'll tell her that the child went missing. With our current financial situation... we might be unable to pay the next offerings if this keeps on...

**Mogura Member A**<br>
You don't need to say more. I understand. Here, these are your rewards. We appreciate your efforts.

**Citizen A**<br>
Woah, is this amount right...? Seems a bit much...

**Mogura Member A**<br>
For some reason, the demand for these things within the organization has been increasing. Hence why the offering prices are much higher than before. We pride ourselves on being trustworthy. Once we settled on a price, we will only give you more, never less.

**Citizen A**<br>
Thank you! Thank you so much!

*\[Electronic Branding\]*

**Mogura Member B**<br>
Serial number assigned.

**Mogura Member A**<br>
Hoho? Now this is not something you see every day.

**Citizen A**<br>
Is something wrong...?

**Mogura Member A**<br>
Usually when we do the branding, the child will bawl really hard. Can't blame them though; this hurts, a lot.<br>
This one, on the other hand... no reaction at all.

**Mogura Member B**<br>
Code No. 009. This one's going to the "Ravens", right?

**Citizen A**<br>
......

**Mogura Member A**<br>
Hey, idiot. Don't ask that stuff in front of the customer.

**Citizen A**<br>
Ravens... D, do you mean the Ravens of Kyuu Hou Kai!? May I ask what will happen to her...?

**Mogura Member A**<br>
If it's going to them, nobody knows.

**Citizen A**<br>
I heard rumors that they... do a lot of cruel experiments...

**Mogura Member A**<br>
And what has that got to do with you? You've already sold her, so don't pretend to care about her now, Mr. Shiino.<br>
Or have you changed your mind and decided to back out of this deal?

**Citizen A**<br>
No... I would never dare...

**Mogura Member A**<br>
Very well. The transaction is complete. Go home; your wife is still waiting for you.
