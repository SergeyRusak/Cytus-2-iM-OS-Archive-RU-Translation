**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Update database: Nora has ability to read digital information through brain.<br>
Source: Unknown.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*Yes... I don't know where those images come from as well. After that incident, I gained the ability to see those images even when I'm not sleeping. As long as I focus my mind, I can see them.<br>
Phoenix said, that this ability is also a gift from god.*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Update database: Phoenix, has religious beliefs.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*No. He only believes in one god, the god by the name of "Knowledge".*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Not found, in database,  god with name "Knowledge" across all existing religions<br>
Update database...*

**[Nora]**<br>
*Umm, that's not what I meant... He believes that when humans obtain knowledge, we'll be able to understand Him, stand next to Him, walk the world with Him. We can even become gods ourselves.*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*This unit, don't understand.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*It's fine... All in all, besides studying the virus, Phoenix also started studying this ability of mine.<br>
However, Mogura also requested me to start doing business for them.*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*This unit, want to know, what kind of business.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*... Fortune telling.<br>
ROBO, do you know what this means?*

*\[Loading sounds\]*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Fortune telling, use of supernatural methods, to predict future, seek the truth.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*Exactly. "The Eye of Horus", otherwise known as the All\-knowing eye. This ability started to spread across Node 03 under this very name. It even spread to other places. Even though I can't see the future, as long as it's information recorded by either a surveillance camera or some other equipment, I am able to read it.<br>
They pay large sums of money to Mogura, and Mogura will grant them a meeting with me. I will then help them obtain the information they need... This is a very useful service to people in this world.*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Phoenix, agreed with this?*

**[Nora]**<br>
*I don't know... but he doesn't get the final saying in this situation anyway. Mogura gave him immense pressure. We must create profits for them for us to not face the fate of being discarded. We have no choice but to obey their demands.*
