**Member I**<br>
Nora, are you composing? It's time for your meal.

**[Nora]**<br>
*Thank you.<br>
I've improved ROBO's function. Can you help me test it again?*

**Member I**<br>
Oh! Of course! What kind of function?

**[Nora]**<br>
*A function to express emotion. Turns out a synthetic voice is still not nearly enough. Right now, it should be able to display some simple emotions.*

**Member I**<br>
That sounds pretty cool. Let's give it a shot right away!

**[Nora]**<br>
*......*

**Member I**<br>
......

**[Nora]**<br>
*What do you think?*

**Member I**<br>
Eh? It has already begun? Hmm... the face on the screen didn't change at all.

**[Nora]**<br>
*Eh...?*

**Member I**<br>
Nora, you have no emotion on your face right now either. Moreover, I don't think I've ever seen you express any emotion before...

**[Nora]**<br>
*... I don't know what I should do.*

**Member I**<br>
How come? It's really simple. You think about some things you like, then feel it with your heart... Umm, what am I talking about? Now even I am confused.

**[Nora]**<br>
*What I like...*

*\[Nora Emotion\]*

**Member I**<br>
Oh! The face changed... Eh? It's a crying face. What did you just think about?

**[Nora]**<br>
*Eh? Nothing. All in all, it seems like a success. Thank you.<br>
... Oh right... You've been the one to deliver my meals to me lately. Where's Phoenix?*

**Member I**<br>
Director has been quite busy these days. Besides analyzing the data from the previous scan, I've heard that the Ravens are doing this major project at Lab 03 right now. He's been going there to offer assistance too.

**[Nora]**<br>
*I see...*

*\[Nora Emotion\]*

**Member I**<br>
Ah! The face became a crying face again. What's the matter? Are you feeling down?

**[Nora]**<br>
*Not really. I was just thinking... I wasn't able to talk to him properly the first time. I haven't seen him a lot after that incident.*

**Member I**<br>
......

**[Nora]**<br>
*Does he dislike me...?*

**Member I**<br>
Not at all! Director cares about you more than anybody else!

**[Nora]**<br>
*That's because I am a very important research subject...*

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Member I**<br>
!

**Phoenix**<br>
Ichiro, leave. I have something to say to Nora.

**Member I**<br>
OK...

**Phoenix**<br>
Nora, this is for you. Here, come and take a seat.

**[Nora]**<br>
*......?*

**Phoenix**<br>
Good. Now, try and connect ROBO\_Head's other port to this one here.

*\[Wheelchair activated\]*

**[Nora]**<br>
*Wow! It moved!*

**Phoenix**<br>
This is a wheelchair that can be controlled via virtual connection. This way, you're able to move freely. You are no longer restricted inside this room.

**[Nora]**<br>
*Phoenix... Did you make this?*

**Phoenix**<br>
Yes. Since you're able to speak now, I shouldn't continue limiting your actions.

**[Nora]**<br>
*...... Thank you!*

*\[Nora Emotion\]*

**Phoenix**<br>
However, you are not allowed to leave the Central Lab area. Understand?

**[Nora]**<br>
*Got it!*
