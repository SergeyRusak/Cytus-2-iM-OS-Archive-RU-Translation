**[Nora]**<br>
*Hahaha! Ichiro, you are so dumb!*

*\[Nora Emotion\]*

**Member I**<br>
Argh\~ I lost again! It's practically impossible to beat Nora!

**Member D**<br>
How are you feeling right now after being utterly destroyed by a five\-year\-old?

**Member I**<br>
Shut up! If you're so good, why don't you challenge her! She is definitely not your average five\-year\-old...

**[Nora]**<br>
*If so, how about we stop playing chess and switch to a game that relies solely on luck? That way, it's fair to everybody.*

**Member D**<br>
Ho? Not a bad idea. Lemme find one.

**Member I**<br>
If it's only about luck then I won't lose!

**Member D**<br>
That I can't disagree with... your luck scares me sometimes... I can never understand why someone as dumb as you ever got a job in this place.

**[Nora]**<br>
*Haha, that's mean.*

**Member I**<br>
Damnit...<br>
Oh, right! Have you heard Nora's new song? It's really dope!

**[Nora]**<br>
*That song's still unfinished...*

**Member D**<br>
Then show it to me after you've finished it. I am looking forward to it a lot.<br>
Nora is truly amazing. She can compose music AND she is knowledgeable in mechanical engineering.

**[Nora]**<br>
*Both mechanical engineering and programming are taught to me by Phoenix. I hope I can grow up to be someone like him. If I can be a musician as a side gig, even better.*

*\[Nora Emotion\]*

**Member I**<br>
Grow up...

**Member D**<br>
Hmm, you definitely can. We will offer you our wholehearted support.

**Member I**<br>
Ah... that's right! Nora's going to be even more amazing after she grows up!

**Phoenix**<br>
Hey, break time's over. Get back to work. Nora, you're sleeping in the silent chamber tonight. You should rest early.

**[Nora]**<br>
*... OK.*

*\[Nora Emotion\]*

**Member I**<br>
Can't help it then. We'll play again tomorrow!

**[Nora]**<br>
*Sure. I will not lose!*

*[→Signal Switch to Nora'sRoom]*

**Phoenix**<br>
The setting is complete. You can enter the silent chamber now.

**[Nora]**<br>
*It's really hard to sleep in this. It's cramped and dark inside...*

**Phoenix**<br>
I know. This is all to stabilize your symptoms of nosebleed and epilepsy that occasionally occur during your sleep. Just hang in there. Do you still get nightmares these days?

**[Nora]**<br>
*Uh\-huh... I still do sometimes, but they are a lot less scary now.*

**Phoenix**<br>
Try and see if you can remember the contents of your dream. It is also helpful for our research. Maybe we can discover something from your dreams.<br>
Alright, time for you to sleep.

**[Nora]**<br>
*OK, understood.<br>
I want to drink some water before I sleep... Ah, I left my water bottle in the break room. can I go get it?*

**Phoenix**<br>
Sure. Can you go on your own?

**[Nora]**<br>
*Yes.*

*[→Signal Switch to CLab06]*

**[Nora]**<br>
*Water bottle water bottle...*

**Member I**<br>
Poor Nora... I don't know what to reply after hearing that.

**Member D**<br>
You mean the "grow up to be like Phoenix" part? Ha... She has no idea about the crap ton of horrible things director has done.

**Member I**<br>
Despite that, at least she still has her dreams.

**Member D**<br>
You're way too sentimental. If you want to stay here, you should keep your emotions in check. If not, you're going to constantly feel terrible.

**Member I**<br>
Don't you have even some feelings for her!?

**Member D**<br>
... We are simply following our orders to take care of her. Don't think too much.

**Member I**<br>
We only have a few months left. Judging by our current progress, there's a very high chance that she'll be scrapped...

**[Nora]**<br>
*... Scrapped!?*

**Member D**<br>
I don't want to as well... We've already tried our best. After all, she is nothing more than a mere test specimen...

*\[Bottle drops\]*

**Member D, Member I**<br>
!?

**[Nora]**<br>
*... I'm here... to get my water bottle.*

**Member I**<br>
Nora!

**[Nora]**<br>
*I'm going to bed now! Goodnight.*

**Member D, Member I**<br>
......

*[Signal Lost]*
