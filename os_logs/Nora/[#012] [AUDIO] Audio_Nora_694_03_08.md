**Member I**<br>
Nora, time for dinner.

**Nora**<br>
(Nods)

**Phoenix**<br>
Afterward, we'll draw blood for the new formula. That will be it for today. You can go to bed after the blood draw, understand?

**Nora**<br>
(Nods)

**Member I**<br>
Director, this child... she's three years old already, yet she still can't talk?

**Phoenix**<br>
Yes... But her cognitive abilities are working normally.

**Member I**<br>
Could it have something to do with her immunity?

**Phoenix**<br>
In science, the crucial thing is actual evidence. Before I can get a definitive confirmation, I will not make any hasty conclusions.<br>
You, go ask A team to prepare the equipment we'll be using later.

**Member I**<br>
Yes sir... Ah, apologies. I forgot to schedule the phlebotomy room. Director, can you sign this for me? I don't want a time conflict with another team.

**Phoenix**<br>
... Hey, you seem pretty capable when you were in Kim's team. That's why I transferred you over here to be an assistant. Yet you screw up right away.

**Member I**<br>
I'm sorry...

**Phoenix**<br>
Hand me the board. I won't be so kind next time. How many units did you draw last time? Do you have the notes?

**Member I**<br>
Ah... I... that... I'm really sorry! I forgot this one as well...

**Phoenix**<br>
You little...

**Member I**<br>
Eek!

**Nora**<br>
Ah... Ah... (four fingers)

**Phoenix**<br>
Hmm? Ho? Is it forty...?

**Nora**<br>
Hmm. (Nods)

**Phoenix**<br>
Thank you, Nora.<br>
It's because of Nora that you are spared a serious beating. You better thank her.

**Member I**<br>
... She... understands what we are saying?

**Phoenix**<br>
As a matter of fact, Nora's intelligence has already far surpassed that of a regular child in the same age range. However, due to her inability to talk, there are a lot of things we simply can't measure.

**Member I**<br>
... Amazing.

**Phoenix**<br>
Stop spacing out. Proceed with the preparations.

**Member I**<br>
Ah! Yes, sir!

**Phoenix**<br>
Is she asleep?

**Member I**<br>
Yes.<br>
When she's asleep... she looks just like a normal child. It's really hard to imagine that she is so important to the research.

**Phoenix**<br>
Her genes are the keys to the world for us humans. The new medicine we made this time have to be effective...

**Nora**<br>
Hmm......

**Member I**<br>
......?<br>
Director, wait a second. Something's not right with Nora.

**Nora**<br>
Ugh...

**Member I**<br>
Her eyeballs are moving around rapidly. Is she having a nightmare...?

**Phoenix**<br>
......

**Member I**<br>
Yikes! She is having a nosebleed! Nora! Nora...

**Phoenix**<br>
Wait! Don't wake her up for now!

**Nora**<br>
Umm......

**Member I**<br>
It stopped... Director, why did that happen?

**Phoenix**<br>
I have no idea... The surveillance cameras recorded the whole process, right? Retrieve the recording and save it now.<br>
Actually, this is already the third time this has happened. Starting next week, we'll let Nora sleep in the BIT silent chamber and see if we can discover anything from her brainwave activities.

**Member I**<br>
Got it...
