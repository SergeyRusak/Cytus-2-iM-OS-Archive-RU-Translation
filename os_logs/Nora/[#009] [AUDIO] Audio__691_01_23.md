**Member A**<br>
The area around here should get the job done.

**Member I**<br>
That was quite the temper tantrum Brother Kim threw back there...

**Member B**<br>
You must be new here, right? He does that a lot, but in reality, he doesn't have the balls to do anything. You'll get used to it.

**Member I**<br>
Wasn't he incarcerated before...?

**Member B**<br>
Yep, in Node 02. To be honest, all eight Ravens were scientists convicted of felonies in different Nodes. According to rumors, it was Phoenix who later got them out of prison and organized them to be a "team". He was then able to earn Mogura's trust, which led to the current Kyuu Hou Kai.

**Member I**<br>
He was able to organize eight criminals all by himself!?

**Member A**<br>
At least that's what I've heard, but it's very believable. Didn't you see Phoenix manhandling brother Kim's a\*\* back there? Haha, that was quite a sight.

*\[Crying\]*

**Member A**<br>
Just put them over here.<br>
Final confirmation. 001, 003, 004, 005, 008, 009... Good, all present.

**Member I**<br>
These... They're all still little...

**Member B**<br>
Hey, if you are in this business, I advise you to stop being sentimental, rookie. You're going to see A LOT of things like this in the future.

**Member I**<br>
So that's all we need to do? Just dump them here?

**Member A**<br>
Yep. Under direct exposure to the virus, they'll die in a few hours and become food for the beasts.

**Member I**<br>
... May I ask, why don't we just dump them outside the lab? Why do we have to take them all the way out of the city?

**Member A**<br>
Oh, about that, Mogura's leader —— Boss Ryu seems to be a very superstitious person. He is very devoted to stuff like "Taoism" and "Feng Shui" or something like that... In short, he doesn't mind having deaths during experiments, but he forbid us from storing or processing corpses there, saying that it will create "Yin energy"... I think?

**Member B**<br>
We can't just randomly dump them in the city either since it's bad for the organization's image. Therefore, the forbidden area that no one cares about is the best place for such things.

**Member I**<br>
Such a weird set of morals...

**Member B**<br>
Ha! You'll gradually realize this, that people who made it to the top of Node 03 are usually one step away from complete insanity.

**Member A**<br>
Let's go back. There's another batch tomorrow we need to dump. By the time of our next visit, what's left here could be piles of bloodied meat and bones. Rookie, you ok with that?

**Member I**<br>
... I'll be fine.

**Member I**<br>
... I'm ready!

**Member A**<br>
Relax. They're all dead. However, there don't seem to be a lot of creatures around here. Their bodies are still pretty intact...

**Member B**<br>
Haha, what, you freaking out, rookie? I bet the Yin energy here is super strong. Maybe they'll all become ghosts and haunt you forever!

**Member I**<br>
...N... Nonsense...

**Member A**<br>
... What are you, a child...

**？？？**<br>
Ahhh... Hmm...

**Members**<br>
WAHHHHH!!!! IT'S HERE!!!!

**？？？**<br>
Umm...

**Member A**<br>
... Hey, look at that...

**Member B**<br>
One of them is still alive!? It's... 009 from yesterday!

**Member I**<br>
... W, what should we do? Leave her out here for a few more days?

**Member A**<br>
Leave her out my a\*\*! Take her back to Phoenix! There's no way someone's still alive after being exposed to the virus for such a long time. She could have immunity!
