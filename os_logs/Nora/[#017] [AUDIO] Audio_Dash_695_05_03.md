**Kim**<br>
What is this all about!?

**Lam**<br>
Exactly what it says.

**Kim**<br>
You're kidding. You're going to ignore all the things I did in the past just because of this one small incident?

**Lam**<br>
You really think that the profits you created in the past, which is no bigger than your dick mind you, can make up for your mistake this time? Don't make me laugh.

**Kim**<br>
What did you just say!?

**Lam**<br>
All things considered, you better finish this project before the end of the month. If not, then maybe we should saw off your legs and mail them to the buyers so you can literally kneel in front of them as an apology. You like that?

**Kim**<br>
Phoenix occupied the entire Central Lab to play house with his daughter! There's no way we can...

**Lam**<br>
I can already think of multiple methods for you to complete this thing within a month. Of course, I'm not going to help you out.<br>
Kim, in Node 03, those who don't have the ability can only drown in the sewers. <br>
You don't need me to teach you that lesson again, right?

**Kim**<br>
......

**Lam**<br>
When you're half as capable as Phoenix, then you get to whine about him. If not, I suggest you mind your own business first.

**Kim**<br>
Motherf\*\*\*\*\*! Who does he think he is!?

**Member A**<br>
Brother Kim, what should we do...?

**Kim**<br>
How should I know what to do? Damnit, that bastard Phoenix; that specimen was recycled from my team in the first place. Now he's getting all so cocky...

**Member B**<br>
......

**Kim**<br>
I'll dispose of 009 right now! Let's see what he has left to be so cocky about!

**Member A**<br>
Brother Kim! Please calm down! That will only make the situation A LOT worse!

**Member B**<br>
He's right. We should figure out how we're going to finish that project within a month. Isn't that more practical?

**Kim**<br>
... No good. This budget... The number of tests we can perform is far too few.

**Member B**<br>
How about we sell some elements to the folks at "Hou Sang Tong"? I heard that they are paying good prices for Tritium. We just so happen to have some here.

**Kim**<br>
......! That's right. Go check the storage. You finally came up with something useful!

**Member A**<br>
Ah man... can't do. Right now, the research project at Brother Chen's place has taken almost all of our Tritium supply... What we have left is just too little to sell.

**Kim**<br>
S\*\*\*! We're all Ravens... Why is it that I'm the one to have so many goddamn restrictions. This is bulls\*\*\*...

**Member B**<br>
Probably because he makes more money...

**Kim**<br>
Huh!? Do you have a death wish!?

**Member B**<br>
Yikes! I'm really sorry!

**Kim**<br>
... We'll steal some.

**Member A**<br>
Eh?

**Kim**<br>
I know where he stores the Tritium. You people are going to steal some for me.

**Member B**<br>
That's impossible! The security at Lab 03 is several times tighter than what we have here!

**Kim**<br>
I used to operate in that lab. I know the way to sneak inside... I have a plan...

**Member A, Member B**<br>
