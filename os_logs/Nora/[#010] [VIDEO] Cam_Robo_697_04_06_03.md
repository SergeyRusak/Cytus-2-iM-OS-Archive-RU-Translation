Phoenix allowed me to live here because of that as well.*

*Nora, how do you view, Phoenix?*

*... Without him, I would've already been eaten by wild beasts. He gave me food, clothes, a place to live and he is very kind to me too... This wheelchair is also something he made for me. I am very thankful to him.*
