## Log Content
**[Nora]**<br>
*ROBO, why did you lie? You even made a fake report.*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*This unit, decision, Nora and Phoenix's life threatened.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*... Weird. I don't remember inputting this kind of logistics in your settings. Don't move, I'll perform a basic troubleshoot for you.*

*\[Removing parts\]*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Nora, this unit, wants to ask question.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*ROBO really likes to ask questions... What do you want to ask?*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Data shows: Lying is an action that's against moral principles. Not a positive thing. In serious cases, lying will result in a criminal trial.<br>
Conflict with Nora's previously mentioned moral values. <br>
Please explain, reason.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*I'm not sure myself either... However, if you didn't produce that fake report, the situation would've become more dangerous for us, without a doubt.<br>
In reality, you saved us. Thank you, ROBO.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*... Right, if we can categorize this incident as a method of "protection", we can then explain your motives...*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*This unit, don't have such cognitive preconditions.<br>
Loading Local.log...... 100%<br>
Record shows, at moment, all core systems operating normally.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*Is that so... Then the only explanation is that you did so because of your instincts.<br>
But, artificial intelligence shouldn't have any ambiguity in their thought process. How were you able to create "instincts"...*

*\[Types on keyboard\]*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*... Nora.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*What's the matter?*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*This unit, lied to humans. Executed actions that don't conform to system settings.<br>
Decision: This unit, has malfunction that can't be fixed through self\-diagnostics.<br>
Is this unit, defective product, that should be discarded?*

**[Nora]**<br>
*Of course not... Besides, lying is not that bad. Take Ichiro for example. He often makes mistakes and he lies to Phoenix too... Despite all that, he is still very kind to me. He is a good person.<br>
Ah, don't tell that to Phoenix though. If you do, Ichiro's gonna get punished.*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Not telling Phoenix, does that count as lying?*

**[Nora]**<br>
*It doesn't. You just preferred not to say. It will be fine.*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*This unit, understand.<br>
Therefore, this unit, not defective product that should be discarded.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*I said before that I will not discard you, right? It's a promise I made.*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*But, Nora don't know as well, why this unit, told a lie.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*That's true... I still have no idea.*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Then, this unit would like Nora to tell me one thing.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*What?*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*This unit, what am I?*

**Nora**<br>

**[Nora]**<br>
*... Maybe we should shut you down first. It's necessary that we do a complete diagnosis of your core system. <br>
Activate shutdown command. Enter voiceprint password: [NORA].*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*... Creator voiceprint command, verification success.<br>
Nora, goodbye.*

*\[ROBO_Head Shutdown\]*

**[Nora]**<br>
*Having self\-consciousness will lead to conflict and clashes with self\-awareness. Did the system, after self\-learning... achieved personal growth? If I just leave him alone, it could lead to even more problems.<br>
Maybe we can solve this issue by resetting the system... But if I do that, ROBO's memory...*

**Nora**<br>
......

**[Nora]**<br>
*... No, the way he is now should be just fine.*
