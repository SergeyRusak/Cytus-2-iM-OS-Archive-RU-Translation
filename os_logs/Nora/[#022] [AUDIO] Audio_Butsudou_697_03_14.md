**Phoenix**<br>
Ask your question.

**Zhang**<br>
What the heck? How dare you talk to me like that? Do you have any idea who I am?<br>
Every single woman of Mogura is my property. Without me, you lonely pieces of s\*\*\* can only jerk off yourself in your dirty bedroom. So show me some damn respect!

**Nora**<br>
...... (Looks at Phoenix)

**Phoenix**<br>
Unfortunately, I have no interest in the prostitution industry.

**Zhang**<br>
HUH? Ha! Makes sense. I heard that you've been having quite some fun with that little loli over there. We have girls in this age range too. Don't you underestimate my harem.

**Lam**<br>
Mr. Zhang, you've already used three minutes.

**Zhang**<br>
... Hmph. How I want to spend my money is none of your business. <br>
Hey brat, I want to see the addresses of all the beautiful women in Node 03 who is aged between eight and eighteen. Hurry up.

**Nora**<br>
...... (Shakes head)

**Zhang**<br>
Huh? Why do you mean by shaking your head?

**Phoenix**<br>
... What she means by that is the range is simply too big. There simply isn't enough time. Besides, according to the rules, you can't take the information with you. In addition, there's a limit to how much she can use her ability...

**Zhang**<br>
Why the f\*\*\* are you the one yapping again? Is that loli speech impaired or something?

**Lam**<br>
Phoenix, follow the contract. You do as much as the customer is paying. They know what they are getting.

**Zhang**<br>
Ha, if I'm not satisfied I'll add more money naturally. Now, stop the nonsense and show me the girls!

**Phoenix**<br>
... Nora, you can start.

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

**Zhang**<br>
Ehehehe, this one's top quality. That innocent look and that thicc a\*\*, hoho... Ooh, and her feisty little sister looks pretty tasty too...<br>
Brat, show me the next one!

**Nora**<br>
... Ugh... Ummmm...

**Zhang**<br>
What the hell are you waiting for? Stop wasting my time!

**Nora**<br>
... UGH! Cough cough! AK AK AK!

*\[Things knocked down\]*

**Phoenix**<br>
Nora！

**Lam**<br>
... What is happening to her!? She has a really serious nosebleed!

**Phoenix**<br>
She has exceeded her limit. She can no longer continue. We need to stop right now!

**Zhang**<br>
What nonsense are you talking about? I bought half\-an\-hour! I still haven't seen the best of the best. Keep going!

**Phoenix**<br>
... You heard what I said. Now f\*\*\* off.

**Zhang**<br>
You motherf\*\*\*\*\*...

*\[Gunshot\]*

**Phoenix**<br>
Argh!

**[Nora]**<br>
*……Phoenix……！*

**Zhang**<br>
You hear that? The next shot will be through the head of that brat.

*\[Loads Gun\]*

**Lam**<br>
Mr. Zhang, I hope you realize that your gun is currently pointing at an important property of Mogura.

**Zhang**<br>
......!?

**Bodyguard**<br>
......! Don't move!

**Lam**<br>
Oh, you wanna bet? Who has the faster trigger, your bodyguards, or me?

**Zhang**<br>
... You guys... put your guns down...

**Bodyguard**<br>
Boss...

**Zhang**<br>
Big brother Lam, I... I was just kidding...<br>
See, I put my gun down. Haha... please don't pull the trigger.

**Lam**<br>
As you may see, business is done for the day. We will refund the appropriate amount of fees based on the service time you used. Of course, that fee will be deducted a bit since you injured one of our men. Got any problems?

**Zhang**<br>
No problem! No problem!

**Lam**<br>
Then please, leave.

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

**Phoenix**<br>
Nora, can you stand?

**Nora**<br>
...... (Shakes head)

**Phoenix**<br>
Here, I'll carry you. We'll return to the silent chamber.

**[Nora]**<br>
*... Phoenix... your leg...*

**Phoenix**<br>
This is a minor injury. No big deal.

**Lam**<br>
Hey, what's going on? Are you trying to taint Mogura's reputation?

**Phoenix**<br>
I said before. Nora's ability is nowhere near omnipotent. It's quite a burden to her physically. This is the first time she has such a serious reaction...

**Lam**<br>
Whatever. I never like Zhang to being with.<br>
Nevertheless, I will remind you again. A contract is a contract. If a similar incident like this occurred in future services and brought shame upon Mogura again...

**Phoenix**<br>
You guys don't give a damn as long as you get the money, don't you? Stop making pointless threats. I am well aware of our contract.

**Lam**<br>
... The dragon's reverse scale is not something to toy with. This is my first and final warning. You better behave yourself.
