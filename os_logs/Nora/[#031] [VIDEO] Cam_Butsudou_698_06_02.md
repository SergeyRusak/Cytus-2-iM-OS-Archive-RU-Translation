*\[Door Opens\]*

**Nora**<br>
......

**Huang**<br>
I said I would come back.

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Mr. Huang. Greetings.<br>
You have 20 seconds. Please ask your question.*

**Lam**<br>
... So you only bought 20 seconds? I didn't know that Hou Sang Tong is already this poor, Mr. Huang.

**Huang**<br>
20 seconds... are more than enough.

*\[Flips switch\]*

**Lam**<br>
......!?<br>
Ugh! Ark ark! Blarghhh!

**Kim**<br>
Hahaha! Idiot! Did you really think that I can't do anything with a fake report?<br>
Have a taste of my masterpiece!

**Mogura Bodyguard**<br>
Boss!

*\[Gunshot\]*

**Mogura Bodyguard**<br>
Arghhhh!

**[Nora]**<br>
*ROBO!*

**Lam**<br>
... What... did you do...

**Huang**<br>
A nano\-capsule developed by Kim. The moment I flip this switch, the capsule will explode within your body and release The Ender virus... You're getting too old, Manson. Bet you didn't expect that I added some extra "ingredients" to your meal, didn't you?

*\[Kicks gun away\]*

**Huang**<br>
Without a gun, you're nothing more than a worthless hack. Karma's a b\*\*\*\*, Manson. Enjoy your death from a "cause" you created on your own.<br>
As with this little girl, I'll gladly take her. "The Eye of Horus" shall be property of the Hou Sang Tong. Muhahaha!<br>
Grab her!

**Kim**<br>
No problemo!<br>
... Don't hate me, Nora. It's Phoenix who caused all of this. If you want to hate someone, hate him. Hehehe!

**[Nora]**<br>
*Let me go! ROBO! Wake up!*

**Kim**<br>
It's useless. This baby here is armed with EMP Armor\-piercing rounds! He is now nothing more than a pile of scrap metal, haha!

*\[Consecutive Gunshots\]*

**Huang, Hou Sang Tong Bodyguard**<br>
ARGHHHHH!

**Kim**<br>
......!?

**Lam**<br>
Cough cough... As long as I'm alive... always remember... to kick the gun further away from me... cough cough... bunch of idiots...

**Huang**<br>
... You!

*\[Gunshot\]*

**Lam**<br>
Haha... Cough... Only you left... Put Nora down, and I'll grant you a less painful death... Cough cough...

**Kim**<br>
... Impossible!? Why aren't you dead!?

**Lam**<br>
I told you before... You're not even half as capable as Phoenix... He has developed a vaccine that can vastly reduce the power of The Ender a while ago. Furthermore, he went ahead and tested it on multiple key members of the organization already... If you increased the virus concentration in the capsule, maybe I'm already dead by now... For the first time in my life... I have to thank you for your foolishness...

**Kim**<br>
D... Don't come near me! Another step and I'll blow her brains out!

**Lam**<br>
Did you forget... what happened to you the last time you utter those words?

*\[Loads Gun\]*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Detect...... Nora...... Danger......!!*

**Lam**<br>
!?

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Detect...... Nora...... Danger......!!*

**[Nora]**<br>
*ROBO! NO!*

*\[Heavy Blow\]*

**Lam**<br>
ARGH!

*\[Heavy Blow\]*

**Kim**<br>
UGH!!

**[Nora]**<br>
*STOP IT! [NORA] !!*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*... Creator... voiceprint command... verification... success.<br>
Nora, goodbye...*

*\[ROBO_Head Shutdown\]*

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

*\[ROBO_Head Start-Up\]*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*This unit, start\-up, success. Running self\-diagnostics... complete.<br>
Detect multiple physical damages on hardware.*

**Nora**<br>
......

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Analyzing situation... Unable to comprehend.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*Kill... ROBO... killed someone.*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*... Everyone. here?*

**[Nora]**<br>
*No... Only uncle Lam and Kim... That's not the point. The Mogura people will discover this immediately... We need to run away, fast! Let's go back to Kyuu Hou Kai first! Phoenix is still there!*
