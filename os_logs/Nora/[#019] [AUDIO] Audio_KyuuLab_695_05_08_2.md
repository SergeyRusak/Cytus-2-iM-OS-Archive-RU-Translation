**[Nora]**<br>
*Ichiro's not the thief.*

**Phoenix**<br>
Nora!? Didn't I tell you not to leave Central Lab?

**[Nora]**<br>
*The culprit is Kim.*

**Everyone**<br>
......

**Kim**<br>
What kind of bulls\*\*\* are you mumbling about, you stinkin brat!? Do you want me to break your two arms as well!?

**[Nora]**<br>
*May 3rd, 09:45 P.M.<br>
At the parking lot of Lab 06, you told your team members to steal the items, then fake the evidence to frame Ichiro. The dashboard camera on one of the parked cars has a recording of that conversation. The license plate number of said car is PY \- 5644.*

**Kim**<br>
......!

**[Nora]**<br>
*May 6th, 10:08 P.M.<br>
You met up with a Hou Sang Tong member in area 15 of the downtown area. The transaction was done with cash. The surveillance camera of a barbeque shop at the alley entrance caught you on tape. A total of 9.81 million in cash is still hidden in an abandoned basement located on Shin\-Shen street, Quadrant III.*

**Phoenix**<br>
......

**Kim**<br>
Nonsense...

**Lam**<br>
... Nonsense or not, I'll get the admins to investigate now and we'll know the results soon enough. If what she said is true, I hope you are prepared for the consequences.

**Kim**<br>
F\*\*\* ...... All of you, FREEZE!

**[Nora]**<br>
*Ahh!*

**Phoenix**<br>
Let her go!

**Kim**<br>
Don't come near me! Another step and I'll blow her brains out!

*\[Gunshot\]*

**Kim**<br>
ARGHHHH! My hand!!

**Phoenix**<br>
HEY! What if you accidentally hit Nora!?

**Lam**<br>
I don't care.

**[Nora]**<br>
*Cough cough!... I'm fine.*

**Lam**<br>
Kim! Surrender yourself. You messed with Mogura's business; losing a hand is going to be the least of your worries today!

**Kim**<br>
Goddamnit!

*\[Glass bottle shatter\]*

**Phoenix**<br>
Is that... The Ender!? Where did he...

*\[System Warning\]*

**[Lab System]**<br>
*Warning: High virus concentration level detected. Danger level: A<br>
All gates set to lock down.<br>
All personnel, please remain at your spot and protect yourself with the prevention equipment. *

**Phoenix**<br>
Don't let him get away!

**Lam**<br>
Put on the mask first!<br>
......<br>
So he got away... Good on him.

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

**Phoenix**<br>
Nora! Cough cough... Are you alright?

**[Nora]**<br>
*Yes...*

**Phoenix**<br>
Ah, right. The virus doesn't affect you... Thank goodness. About your accusations of Kim back there, how did you know those things?

**[Nora]**<br>
*My dreams at night... I followed your words and tried very hard to remember my dreams. I discovered that those are not dreams. They are all events recorded by machines. They actually happened...*

**Phoenix**<br>
......!
