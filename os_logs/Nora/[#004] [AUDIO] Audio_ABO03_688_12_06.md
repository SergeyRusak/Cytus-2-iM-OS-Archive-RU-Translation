**Lam**<br>
... Hmm, this is without a doubt an impressive resume and proposal.<br>
I'll be honest with you; we don't need this resume at all. The name "Phoenix Wyle" speaks for itself among researchers. Your reputation far precedes you.

**Phoenix**<br>
I'm flattered. I've also heard plenty of good things about Mr. Lam in the past.

**Lam**<br>
Don't be so polite. I am the head of Node 03's Administration Bureau. Of course you would know me.

**Phoenix**<br>
Certainly. Apologies for my intrusion.

**Lam**<br>
Also, skip the honorifics. Is this some sort of stereotype people of Node 08 have towards Eastern cities...?<br>
That's not how we do things here. Here, power is everything. The amount of respect you get is determined by how much "contribution" you can make. 

**Phoenix**<br>
......

**Lam**<br>
So when I said that "We don't need this resume" just now, I believe you've mistaken what I truly meant.

*\[File Deleted\]*

**Phoenix**<br>
......!?

**Lam**<br>
If you really thought these fancy words will get you access to "our" resources, I advise you to throw that naivety in the trash and think again.

**Phoenix**<br>
.... I have no intention to do that. However, with all due respect, judging by the current technology level of Node 03, you guys will absolutely need someone like me. My background in...

**Lam**<br>
I said it already. Over here, power is everything. Your past, background, achievements... we don't care about any of them.<br>
You must use your own methods to prove your worth and show how much "value" you can bring us.<br>
Did you really think we don't have any former A.R.C. people here? Why can't they survive? Simple, because they have no value to speak of. This is Node 03's way of life..

**Phoenix**<br>
Umm...

**Lam**<br>
Don't get me wrong; I've read all your research papers. As a scientist myself, I personally still have great admiration for the ideals you represent.<br>
But, under our "rules", the way you are now is nothing more than a tiny "fledgling" clinging on to a flimsy branch. It only takes a light breeze for you to fall down the tree and die a horrible death.

**Phoenix**<br>
......

**Lam**<br>
Please leave. Right now, you are not qualified to meet our boss.

**Phoenix**<br>
... Tch.

**Lam**<br>
However, I do sincerely hope... that our next meeting will be one where we are the ones to schedule it. You're a very smart man; you should know what I mean by that.

**Phoenix**<br>
... Understood.

**Lam**<br>
Don't get yourself killed. Node 03 isn't exactly kind to big city folks like you. <br>
I look forward to your growth, Mr. Phoenix. *\*Chuckles\**...
