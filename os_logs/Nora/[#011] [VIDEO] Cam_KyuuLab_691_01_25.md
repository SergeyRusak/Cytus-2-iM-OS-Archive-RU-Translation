**Member I**<br>
Boss!

**Phoenix**<br>
Don't call me Boss; how many times do I have to tell you that? <br>
I prefer "director". Are you new here?

**Member A**<br>
Apologies, director. Please take a look at this.

**Phoenix**<br>
......?<br>
Hey, isn't this a discarded specimen from Kim's project? Don't bring this kind of stuff into Central Lab.

**Member A**<br>
No... That's not it! We indeed discarded her, but this child... she was not affected by the virus. She survived!

**Phoenix**<br>
WHAT!? IS THAT TRUE!?

**Member A**<br>
Absolutely true! We made our trip the exact night of the experiment. After almost an entire day, we went back only to discover that she's still alive...

**Phoenix**<br>
Th... This child is very important! Register her to Central Lab right away! She looks very weak... A team, B team, prepare life support, NOW!<br>
You two, come with me. We need to go get Kim. The necrosis on her legs must be treated immediately, or it would spread to her entire body and that would be too late! This child must survive no matter what!

**Phoenix**<br>
What is her situation?

**Member D**<br>
Yes sir. The amputation surgery on her two legs was very successful. The necrotic cells from Kim's failed tests didn't expand to other body parts.<br>
Her level of synchronization with the life support is also very positive. We estimated a complete recovery in 1 or 2 days.

**Phoenix**<br>
Thank goodness...

**Member D**<br>
Director, this child... is quite intriguing. She experienced so much hardship in the labs, yet we've never heard her cry. She doesn't even seem to show any emotion...

**Phoenix**<br>
She is very special... Starting today, she will be the focal point of our research regarding "The Ender". <br>
Pay extra attention to those Ravens. Do not let those nutheads harm her.

**Member D**<br>
Certainly. Just now, the system has completed the specimen registration process. Her serial number will remain the same: 009. Members of the other labs will be unable to access her.

**Phoenix**<br>
No, remove her from the specimen database. She has way too much value to be placed alongside regular specimens...

**Member D**<br>
Director, without a specimen registration, it will cause us all kinds of trouble...

**Phoenix**<br>
I said before; she is special. From now on, I will take care of her myself.

**Phoenix**<br>
... Nora. We'll call her Nora. Give her an independent directory in the database.

**Member D**<br>
Nora...?

**Phoenix**<br>
It means "The ninth children" in an ancient language. It also has the meaning of "Honor". She will bring light to human civilization!
