**Phoenix**<br>
Nora, how are you feeling now? Better?

**[Nora]**<br>
*Much better.*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*After physical and medical treatment, immune system functioning normally. <br>
Temperature lowered to 36.824 degrees. Recovery process: going well.*

**Phoenix**<br>
Good to hear that. Nora's not afraid of The Ender, yet she fell prey to a small flu virus. You have no idea how much panic the team was in when that news broke out.

**[Nora]**<br>
*... I'm sorry...*

**Phoenix**<br>
No need to apologize. Just so happens that there are no fortune telling requests this week. If any comes in, I'll try my best to push it back for you. Take your time and rest well.

**[Nora]**<br>
*Got it. Thank you.*

**Phoenix**<br>
I'll not disturb you anymore.<br>
ROBO, take good care of her.

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Message accepted, Phoenix.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*Phoenix worries way too much... This is just a small cold. Nothing serious.<br>
ROBO, you don't have to watch over me all the time too. It's pretty boring, right?*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*This unit, don't understand, definition of "boring".<br>
Decision: This unit, not equipped, with logistics of said human emotion.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*You do though. Sometimes, when you're not doing anything, your screen will display some random icons or your body will perform some meaningless actions. That's what we call "bored".<br>
You can go to the workshop to compose your music. I'll be just fine on my own.*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*This unit, judgment, Nora, not yet fully recovered. May need assistance from this unit any time.<br>
In addition...*

**[Nora]**<br>
*Hmm?*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Data shows: when having a conversation partner, human body will recover faster.<br>
According to a document from 684 N.A., researcher compared a sample size of 500 patients infected with the cold to normal cold patients. These 500 patients all have a conversation partner. He observed a 28% decrease in recovery time. Difference is significant.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*You're talking about the paper written by Jones Walker, right? Although his speculation did indeed correlate with the experiment results, it felt way too forced. He was not able to come up with a scientific theory to back his explanation.<br>
If Phoenix is here, he'll definitely say that what he's doing is essentially praying. The researcher is praying desperately that the truth is exactly as he has hoped.*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Phoenix's point of view, this unit agrees.<br>
Nora, this unit's creator and target of protection. This unit, want to accelerate Nora's recovery.<br>
Decision: Stay by Nora's side until she fully recovers.*

**Nora**<br>
......

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*... Is, this decision, weird?*

**[Nora]**<br>
*Yep, it is weird.<br>
Nevertheless, I feel like the way ROBO is right now is just fine.*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*This unit, will follow Nora's instructions.<br>
After Nora recovered, this unit, suggest Nora pay more notice to her health conditions. Excluding the flu factor, overall health parameters, 7% decrease compared to last week. <br>
Downward trend quite obvious.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*... Thank you for the consideration, ROBO. I will do just that.<br>
If you don't mind, can you do me a favor?*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Of course.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*I want to listen to some music. Can you play it for me?*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Command accepted. Commence operation.<br>
This unit, searching music that helps body recuperate, 7,902,005 results found...*

**[Nora]**<br>
*You don't have to search.<br>
Can you play《Jakarta PROGRESSION》for me?*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*This unit, does not recommend.《Jakarta PROGRESSION》vibrant style, complicated rhythms. Not suitable for patient to recuperate.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*It's fine. I like that song, and I want to listen to it now.*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Got it. Will follow Nora's instruction.*

*\[Music\]*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Thank you to Nora for liking this unit's first musical composition.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*You're welcome. I also have to thank ROBO for creating such wonderful music.*

*\[ROBO_Head shaking his head\]*

**[Nora]**<br>
*Woah! ROBO, what are you doing?*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Self\-diagnostics...... 100%<br>
... This unit currently in irregular state, analysis, unavailable. Signal velocity and energy conversion efficiency, operating stably at 125% of usual capacity.<br>
Nora, please explain, this condition.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*Haha, I can understand that feeling. It's probably...*

**Nora**<br>
......

**[Nora]**<br>
*... "Happiness", I believe.*

*[Signal Lost]*
