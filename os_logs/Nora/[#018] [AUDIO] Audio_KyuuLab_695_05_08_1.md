**Phoenix**<br>
I believe everyone already knew the reason we are gathering here.<br>
A few days ago, the element warehouse of Lab 03 was broken into by a thief.

**Members**<br>
Did someone decrypt our security system!?

**Lam**<br>
The thief's methods are extremely clean, so clean to a point that I am not willing to believe it's an outsider's handiwork. If there really is someone capable of hacking our system in Node 03, it's very unlikely that we don't know anything about such a talent.

**Phoenix**<br>
Indeed. Both the lab and the security system showed no signs of a forceful entry. <br>
Tritium, the element that was stolen this time, is a highly valuable material on the market right now. I suspect that someone within the organization stole the element for money.

**Everyone**<br>
......

**Lam**<br>
To be honest, I don't give a damn about the management within this organization. <br>
Theft, robbery, or even murder; you're free to do whatever you desire.<br>
I'll go as far as saying that if you can prove your worth and ability by committing the previous crimes, I will even advocate such actions.

**Everyone**<br>
......

**Lam**<br>
However, as everyone may know, the project Chen is working on right now at Lab 03 will play a very crucial role in Mogura's growth for the entire second half of the year.<br>
To the person who dared to mess with such an important project for personal benefits... You're not getting away.

**Everyone**<br>
......

**Lam**<br>
So nobody wants to confess?

**Everyone**<br>
......

**Lam**<br>
Ichiro Murata. You here?

**Member I**<br>
!?<br>
Y, Yes, sir!

**Lam**<br>
At 11:00 P.M. of the 5th, the surveillance camera in Lab 03 started to experience malfunctions. The items disappeared not long after that. Where were you at the time?

**Member I**<br>
In my own room...

**Member I**<br>
Eh!?

**Lam**<br>
By yourself?

**Member I**<br>
... B, by myself...

**Kim**<br>
Now that I think about it... Ichiro's family has always been short on money. He used to be the person responsible for managing the imports and exports of the element warehouse at Lab 03. He has a very good understanding of the security system's functions.

**Kim**<br>
Ah, right! I remember! You installed a brand\-new resident care system for your grandmother just two days ago, right? Where did you get the money?

**Member I**<br>
I, I got it from my own savings of course... Besides, wasn't brother Kim the one who recommended me to install that system!?

**Kim**<br>
Hey, I did indeed talk to you about it. But this timing... coincidence? Isn't that a bit far\-fetched?

**Member I**<br>
If I was the one who stole the items, why would I do such a major purchase so soon afterward!? Even I know that's going to be super suspicious! Just take a look at the transaction records and you'll see that I...

**Lam**<br>
Ichiro Murata, I investigated your account. I did not see the transaction record you mentioned.

**Member I**<br>
...Eh?

**Lam**<br>
Take a look yourself.

**Member I**<br>
This... How is this possible?

**Lam**<br>
I'll get to the point. On the air vent on\-site, we discovered your fingerprint... a rather new one too.

**Phoenix**<br>
......

**Member I**<br>
It's not me! Director, please believe me! It's really not me who stole it!

**Phoenix**<br>
... I personally don't believe you have the nerves to do such a thing.
