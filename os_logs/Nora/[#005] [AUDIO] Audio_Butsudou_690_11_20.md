**Lam**<br>
So we meet again. In less than two years... judging by your face, you must've been through a lot between our two meetings, haven't you? You certainly didn't disappoint me.

**Phoenix**<br>
......

**Lam**<br>
And those masked people behind you are...?

**Phoenix**<br>
These eight people are my "team members".

**Lam**<br>
...... Boss can meet you only. Those who don't show their face are not allowed to go inside. They must wait outside.

**Phoenix**<br>
We are a team. Without them, we couldn't complete the projects you people are interested in. They are going inside together with me.

**Lam**<br>
... You don't want to annoy me.

**[Ryu]**<br>
*Manson, it's fine. Let them in.*

**Lam**<br>
......

**Phoenix**<br>
Thank you. Since they made a compromise... you guys, take off your masks.

**Lam**<br>
......!

**Lam**<br>
... No wonder... Haha, I see. Being able to organize these people... not bad, not bad at all. Looks like you've truly gone above and beyond my expectations...

**Phoenix**<br>
... Enough with the chit\-chat. Let us in so we can talk business.

**Lam**<br>
Of course. We would like you to clear the security check first. This way, please.

*[â†’Signal Switches]*

**Ryu**<br>
... So you're Phoenix?

**Phoenix**<br>
I'm guessing that you're "Ryu"? The actual leader of "Mogura".

**Ryu**<br>
You can say that.

**Phoenix**<br>
Doesn't see anyone who refuses to show their face, yet covers up your own face. Nice fair rule you got there.

**Ryu**<br>
Haha, I like your attitude. It's different than those spineless cowards out there.<br>
But, that's not the point today. The thing I'm interested in is your "merchandise".

**Phoenix**<br>
Of course. I'm not here to be a sleazy salesman either. We'll ignore the ones that don't make money and jump straight to the big guns. I know what you guys want to see the most. Hey, open it up.

*\[Device Door Opens\]*

**Lam**<br>
......!!

**Ryu**<br>
So the rumors are true...

**Phoenix**<br>
W... Where am I? W... who are you guys!?

**Phoenix**<br>
As you can see right now, appearance, voice, hair, fingerprint, all perfectly replicated. You can take a look at the scanners. The ID and personal information displayed are all mine as well. Even the latest biometric system at Node 08's Administration Bureau can't tell the difference.

**Phoenix**<br>
H... Help! Please, let me go!

**Lam**<br>
This really is a perfect copy... Even the scars on your face... Unbelievable...

**Ryu**<br>
This person is...?

**Phoenix**<br>
A random male sample we seized from the downtown area. This is how he originally looked and some basic information. You can see that his age, height, weight are all completely different. As long as the blood type and gender are the same, we can pretty much achieve a result like this all the time.

**Ryu**<br>
... Nonetheless, rumors are still rumors. This could be your twin brother that nobody knows about, right?

**Lam**<br>
......

**Phoenix**<br>
*\*Chuckles\**, I surely didn't expect such a dumb question to come from someone as smart as you.<br>
However, it's about time we conclude this demonstration.

*\[Gunshot\]*

**Phoenix**<br>
Argh!!

**Lam**<br>
......!?

**Phoenix**<br>
Although killing him doesn't completely rule out the possibility of what you brought up, it does show that I can make them as much as and whenever I want. Of course, making these things cost a fortune. Do you understand what I'm saying?

**Ryu**<br>
......

**Lam**<br>
... You bastard! How dare you bring a gun inside!

**Phoenix**<br>
Ho? This is another one of our merchandises, but compare to a perfect human replica, I felt that you guys probably don't have much interest in it, hence why I didn't bother to tell. Your security check devices are quite the ancient pieces of trash.

*\[Applaud\]*

**Ryu**<br>
*\*Chuckles\**... Hahahaha! Excellent! You're quite the man!

**Lam**<br>
......

**Ryu**<br>
No need for another word. We've all seen the business opportunities you created in the past year. You have certainly proven your worth to Mogura.<br>
Speak. What are your conditions?

**Phoenix**<br>
I want to establish a science research organization in Node 03 with us 9 at the helm. Under your investment, you get to use all of our current inventions and their subsequent mass productions. However, in return, 60% of the income profit from those inventions will belong to us as funds for our own research. You can have the remaining 40%. In addition, you also have to provide the group's privileges and services in Node 03 for us to utilize.

**Ryu**<br>
Not a problem. Manson, prepare the contract. I'll let you handle the documents.

**Lam**<br>
Yes, boss.

**Phoenix**<br>
You're pretty forthright yourself too.

**Ryu**<br>
Do you have a name for your organization?

**Phoenix**<br>
Is that what you care about...? Nothing particular comes to mind right now.

**Ryu**<br>
Phoenix... [Kyuu Hou Kai], that shall be your name. We will be a combo of the "Dragon" and the "Phoenix"!

**Phoenix**<br>
Whatever you please.
