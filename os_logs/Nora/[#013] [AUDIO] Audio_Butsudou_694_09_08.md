**Phoenix**<br>
Is there something you want?

**Ryu**<br>
... Phoenix, it has been four years since Kyuu Hou Kai's establishment. The organization has certainly brought our city quite the benefit and growth...<br>
However, when it comes to "The Ender research", the situation has always been rather... unclear. I want to understand the current process.

**Phoenix**<br>
A few months ago, we've successfully developed a medicine that can slightly reduce the symptoms of those infected...

**Ryu**<br>
That's not my question. Right now, the investors are not very happy because your research has been constantly losing money. In fact, many of the budgets that were supposed to go into other researches have all been absorbed by your project. Care to explain yourself?

**Phoenix**<br>
I believe our initial agreement stated that as long as the total profit of the organization reaches a certain threshold, whatever remains can be used to conduct our own researches. Am I mistaken?

**Lam**<br>
Some of the Ravens have been complaining, that your project is taking up the entire Central Lab and almost all the resources.

**Phoenix**<br>
Funny, what do they think we are, roommates? I'm the one who decides how the spaces and resources are distributed.

**Lam**<br>
Phoenix, I heard that you've been raising a specimen in the lab for the past three years. Is this true?

**Phoenix**<br>
... Yes. That child has immunity to the virus.

**Lam**<br>
You've been studying the same specimen for three years, yet you haven't made any progress.

**Phoenix**<br>
Didn't I just mention, the medicine we developed last month...

**Ryu**<br>
That thing's not going to sell even a single pill. You should know this very well, don't you?

**Lam**<br>
Regular civilians have no interest in the world outside of the Nodes. The "hunters" and "gravediggers" who go out regularly all have the proper equipment as well.

**Phoenix**<br>
... Our purpose for researching The Ender, I'm sure you guys haven't forgotten about it, have you? If we're able to crack the secret code behind this virus and grant humans complete immunity, we will gain access to the entire world map. Node 03 can expand to a scale never imagined before. It can even take over other Nodes.

**Ryu**<br>
Certainly. This is a vision we acknowledged back then too. However, for a project this grand and this long\-term, I may never see it come to fruition in my entire life if we were to judge by the pace you are progressing right now.

**Phoenix**<br>
Ryu, I believe you are not someone who's that short\-sighted. Think about your place in history, in the future we created together... Just give me some more time and patience.

**Ryu**<br>
... One year. I will give you one more year. If you still can't get a positive income here, this project will be forcefully terminated. That's the one thing I will not compromise. At the very least, you have to produce some kind of value. As long as you can do that, I will not interfere with your other actions.

**Phoenix**<br>
Understood. Then I'll take my leave.

**Lam**<br>
Hold it right there. Let me go take a look at that specimen.

**Phoenix**<br>
... Why?

**Lam**<br>
Right now, the profits of Kyuu Hou Kai are held up entirely by the eight Ravens. I can't just ignore their complaints all together.<br>
Besides, I'm also quite curious about why you are so persistent about her...

**Phoenix**<br>
... Guess it's fine. There's a very high possbility that Nora has even more unique talents than immunity. She is completely different than the other one\-time use specimens. You understand once you see her.

**Lam**<br>
Nora... so she has a name? Whatever, take me to her.

*[â†’Signal Switch to Nora'sRoom]*

**Lam**<br>
She is the one?

**Phoenix**<br>
Yes. Nora, say hi. This is uncle Lam.

**Nora**<br>
...... (Nods)

*\[Music\]*

**Lam**<br>
What is she doing?

**Phoenix**<br>
Composing. Every instrument in this room, and those machinery over there; she invented and built all of them. Can you imagine that? A four\-year\-old child did all this! Although she can't talk, she is already displaying an extremely high level of intelligence.

**Lam**<br>
... What happened to her legs?

**Phoenix**<br>
She was originally a specimen of another research project over at Kim's team. The experiment later failed. In order to save her, we had to amputate her legs.

**Lam**<br>
......

**Phoenix**<br>
Let's talk outside. It gets a bit noisy in here when she starts composing.

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Phoenix**<br>
Do you understand now?

**Lam**<br>
... It is indeed surprising that she has such creative abilities at such a young age.<br>
However, what does that have to do with your research? I can see that she is no ordinary child, but I can't see the reason why you are so persistent about her.

**Phoenix**<br>
As of now, we haven't discovered a direct correlation between her intelligence and the virus. However, it is clear that she is not an ordinary human. She may have other secrets hidden inside her...

**Lam**<br>
Other secrets?

**Phoenix**<br>
No. I haven't figure out the specifcs either...

**Lam**<br>
You're not someone who fumbles with his words... I'll be frank. Some of the Ravens believe that you've developed personal feelings for the specimen. You are wasting a large amount of resources on her just so you can drag out the research and have more time with her.

**Phoenix**<br>
What!?

**Lam**<br>
If that's really the case, I advise you to come back to your senses. It's clear to me that you're not that kind of person, or should I say you've already lost the right to be one.<br>
All in all, you heard what the boss said. Another year of losing money and this research project will be terminated. This child will also have to be scrapped. Understand?

**Phoenix**<br>
... Understood.
