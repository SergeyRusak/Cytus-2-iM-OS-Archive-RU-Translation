Research Log 6980601\_23

Alright... This is the first research log for June of 698. This week, the medicine team tested a formula consists of refactored Acetylcysteine molecules in an attempt to suppress external symptoms. Despite several attempts, we are still unable to prevent "The Ender" from directly attacking human cells and leading to other symptoms. Similar to what has happened in the past, "The Ender" acts in a way that's almost... life\-like. It will bypass all defensive barriers and find new weaknesses to kill its host.

The specimen team performed a more comprehensive check\-up on Nora this week, yet nothing was found. Her blood doesn't contain any unknown element that can suppress "The Ender". It's just like every other person's blood. However, this discovery did indeed spark a new theory in my mind: What if "The Ender" is a completely different virus type, one that's never been observed before?

I have suspected a long time ago, that besides some special element within her body, it could be her other characteristics that have been stopping "The Ender" from harming her body. After we discovered Nora's ability, we've also started analyzing her brainwaves. Due to Nora's frequent use of her ability in recent days, patterns that were previously hidden have become clearer and clearer... This is still a speculation, but I believe that Nora's brainwaves are the keys to opening the door. On top of that, Nora's body doesn't make her "immune" to the virus. Instead, it is using some sort of mechanism so she can... "coexist" with "The Ender".

The only issue is that as of today, we haven't found any evidence that can support this speculation.  Nora's brainwaves are almost as hard to grasp as "The Ender". It's extremely difficult to replicate the same result multiple times... I still need more active samples, especially her brainwave data while she is using her ability. If only... we have more cases of people with immunity...

... If we do... Nora won't have to go through these hardships anymore. She can go to Node 08, showcase her talents at A.R.C. and bring benefits to human civilization... She can reach even higher places than I did... or... she could just lead a normal life... one that everyone human being deserves... Compose music from time to time... That's happiness to her, right?

Happiness, eh... What do I know... about happiness? ... In the past, I did so many despicable things, all in the name of research... Manson was right. I've long lost the right to have a heart or feel any emotion...

......

It seems that I... am a bit too drunk. What was I thinking... saying all this stuff in a research log... Whatever, the research will continue tomorrow, once the tedious fortune telling is over. I hope we can have a significant breakthrough very soon. Recording complete. Voiceprint verification: Phoenix Wyle.
