**Member I**<br>
Nora, get ready for your scan... Nora? Where are you\~?

**[Nora]**<br>
*Ichiro.*

**Member I**<br>
Yikes!? Who's calling me!?

**[Nora]**<br>
*... I'm Nora. Looks like it's a success. I'm behind the shelf.*

**Member I**<br>
Nora!? This machine... did you make this?

**[Nora]**<br>
*Yes. The name is "ROBO\_Head". It's a bit like... a translator, I guess? This way, I'm able to talk.*

**Member I**<br>
Wow... So this is your voice?

**[Nora]**<br>
*It's a simulation of my voiceprint. I don't know how to talk to begin with, so I have no clue whether this is my voice or not.*

**Member I**<br>
That's incredible! We're finally able to hear you talk... How did you do that?

**[Nora]**<br>
*A.R.C. announced the cyTus technology a while ago. I wrote a program with its protocol. It can directly translate what I want to speak via virtual connection.*

**Member I**<br>
It really is incredible. You're truly a child prodigy!

**[Nora]**<br>
*There are still some functions I would like to test out. Do you mind helping me out a little bit?*

**Member I**<br>
Not a problem!

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

**[Nora]**<br>
*Hmm... Everything's more or less functioning normally. There are some places that can use some minor tweaking... Thank you for helping me out with the tests.*

**Member I**<br>
This is awesome! We need to tell director ASAP!

**[Nora]**<br>
*Wait!*

**Member I**<br>
Eh?

**[Nora]**<br>
*... Still not prepared... about what to tell him...*

**Member I**<br>
How come? You're speaking very fluently! On top of that, your speech doesn't sound like a child at all!

**[Nora]**<br>
*That's not the problem...<br>
Children... How do they talk? I don't know, because all I have around me is you guys.*

**Member I**<br>
Ah... sorry.

**[Nora]**<br>
*Why are you apologizing?*

**Member I**<br>
Umm, nothing. It's just that... when I hear those words coming directly from you, I feel sorry for the kind of life we put you through...

**[Nora]**<br>
*I've never had a different life before. Ichiro, you don't have to be sorry.*

**Member I**<br>
......

**Phoenix**<br>
Ichiro, we asked you to pick up Nora. Why are you taking so long? Everyone's been waiting for you.

**Member I**<br>
Ah! Director! Look! Nora is amazing. She made this machine by herself. She is now able to speak!

**[Nora]**<br>
*......*

**Phoenix**<br>
......?

**Member I**<br>
What's wrong? Nora! Show it to director!

**[Nora]**<br>
*... H, Hello, I'm Nora...*

**Phoenix**<br>
......

**[Nora]**<br>
*... Ummm...*

**Phoenix**<br>
... Did you make this with the cyTus technology? Very impressive. You're able to master the programming language I taught you in a very short time.

**[Nora]**<br>
*Thank you...*

**Phoenix**<br>
Take her to do the scan. We are already having a serious delay.

**Member I**<br>
Ah... Yes sir! I'm sorry!

**[Nora]**<br>
*......*
