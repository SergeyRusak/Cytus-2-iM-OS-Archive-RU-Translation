**Lam**<br>
My, my, the head of the well\-known Hou Sang Tong decides to spare his time to pay us a visit. We apologize for the lack of a proper welcome, Mr. Huang.<br>
Your recycling business has been quite successful. It has benefitted us a lot too.

**Huang**<br>
Rumors spread fast, Manson.<br>
"The Eye of Horus" If it's really that useful, us Hou Sang Tong and you Mogura will all gain significant profits from it. The smell of money is strong with this one.

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Nora、Phoenix**<br>
......!

**Kim**<br>
Long time no see.<br>
Ooh, looking at all your surprised faces is making my hand itch... even though I don't have a hand. Ehehe...

**Lam**<br>
This guy went and seeked refugee at Hou Sang Tong after he ran away from here. He is more cockroach than man if you ask me. He seems to find a living among trash.

**Phoenix**<br>
... After selling Tritium to Hou Sang Tong, you decided to sell yourself after that?

**Kim**<br>
Hoho, right now, I am Hou Sang Tong's leading researcher. You guys can't touch me, so save your bullets.<br>
Got a couple more bodyguards, it seems? And what's that big tin can doing here? Are you guys THAT afraid of getting killed? Hehehe...

**[Nora]**<br>
*......*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Greetings, Mr. Huang, Mr. Kim. This unit is ROBO\_Head\- Unit 02.<br>
Please ask your question. This unit is responsible for organizing Nora's fortune telling results and presenting them to you.*

**Kim**<br>
Hmph, so it even has an audio system... You're really using this pile of scrap metal as a bodyguard? Phoenix, is your brain alright? Did you get lead poisoning or some random crap?

**Huang**<br>
Kim, the four\-and\-a\-half minutes I purchased is not for you to say hi to your old friends, so shut up.

**Kim**<br>
Tch......

**Huang**<br>
I remember the rules are that we can ask anything, right?<br>
Then, I would like to see Kyuu Hou Kai's research report on "The Ender" virus.

**Lam**<br>
......

**Phoenix**<br>
... That's my research. So stop dreaming about it. The meeting ends here.<br>
Nora, let's go back.

**Lam**<br>
Phoenix, follow the contract. Or are you worried that once this bastard gets your report you will become worthless?

**Phoenix**<br>
......

**[Nora]**<br>
*... Understood... I'll take a look now.*

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

**Huang**<br>
Is that all? Plenty of results, but only a few of them are actually useful.<br>
I heard that Kyuu Hou Kai has been studying "The Ender" for many years. Turns out this is the best they got. How disappointing.

**Lam**<br>
......

**Phoenix**<br>
If you're done here, f\*\*\* off.

**Kim**<br>
Hehehe, boss Huang... I believe that this data is not the complete research report.

**Phoenix**<br>
......!

**Kim**<br>
I know this man very well. He will not write down all his thoughts and conclusions in the records... Instead, he hides them in an encrypted file that only he can access.<br>
B\-U\-T, under "The Eye of Horus", these files should all be accessible to her.

**Phoenix**<br>
... I have no idea what you are talking about.

**Kim**<br>
You have no idea? Then I wonder if Nora has any idea? You should be able to see them, right? Then why don't you show us?

**[Nora]**<br>
*...... I......*

**Phoenix**<br>
......

*\[Loads Gun\]*

**Lam**<br>
Hey, don't let me say if for the third time. Follow the "contract"...

*\[Prints document\]*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Fortune telling report, organize complete.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*... Eh!?*

**Phoenix**<br>
......!

**Lam**<br>
......

**Huang**<br>
Now this is more like it. Kim, take a look.

**Kim**<br>
... This does indeed look like Phoenix's handiwork. Hahaha! I see. I see! With this, it will be much easier for me to make that... hehe!

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Time is up. Thank you for using the service of the All\-knowing eye. The exit is at the rear right.*

**Kim**<br>
Muhahahah! Phoenix! Prepare to meet your end! The secret of The Ender is now mine!

**Huang**<br>
Looks like "The Eye of Horus" is indeed trustworthy. I will come back next time.

**Lam**<br>
