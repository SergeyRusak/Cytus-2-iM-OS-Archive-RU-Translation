## Log Content
**[Nora]**<br>
*Even though after that incident where Phoenix got injured, Mogura sent us a lot of their bodyguards, I still wanted to be protected by someone I can trust.*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Therefore, this unit, was created. Understood.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*Yes... I don't want Phoenix to be injured again...<br>
ROBO, you may not realize this, but you're really strong. Your body was painstakingly crafted by me. In an emergency, it will definitely come in handy.*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Fortune telling, massive decrease in Nora and Phoenix's safety parameters. This unit, suggestion, stop participating, in said event.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*We can't.<br>
The contract does not allow us to do this.*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Decision: This contract, conditions, unfair.<br>
Suggestion: Renegotiation*

**[Nora]**<br>
*... Looks like there's still a lot for you to learn, ROBO.*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*This unit, don't understand.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*ROBO, I want you to have the ability to distinguish between right and wrong. That's why I spent so much time on setting your moral values, which I did so by recalibrating the data on "Unit 01". I hope that when you make decisions, you can make a reasonable and fair judgment. However, most things in this world are neither reasonable nor fair...*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*If so, should base on statistical average, to produce accurate decision results.<br>
This unit, suggestion: recalibrating the parameters.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*No. I want to know what kind of decision you will make in this cruel environment. Therefore, it is crucial that you have a kind and considerate heart.*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*This unit, doesn't have the organ "Heart".*

**[Nora]**<br>
*Haha... That was just a metaphor. ROBO, you're so funny!*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Nora, feeling happy. Update humor logistics.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*I feel so relaxed when I'm talking to you... I haven't felt like this in a very long time...<br>
When was the last time I laughed out loud? Ever since I learned that I was an item that could be discarded at any moment...*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Nora, human, not item. Different from, this unit.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*Thank you, but don't worry. I will not discard you.<br>
From now on, I shall be in your care, <br>
ROBO\_Head \- Unit 02.*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Understood. This unit, be in your care as well.*
