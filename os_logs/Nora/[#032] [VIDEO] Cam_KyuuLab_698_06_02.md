**[Nora]**<br>
*Phoenix! I...*

**Phoenix**<br>
No need to talk! I've already received the report. Quick, come with me! Both the Mogura and Hou Sang Tong people are coming towards here.

**[Nora]**<br>
*I'm sorry... It's all because of me...*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Responsibility, all on this unit. Did not execute protect command correctly.*

**Phoenix**<br>
Ahah, Manson's dead... Mogura only wants to dispose of ROBO\_Head. The bigger problem is with the Hou Sang Tong people. They could destroy the entire Lab and kill everybody...

**Nora**<br>
......

**Phoenix**<br>
Regardless of what happened, I will not let any one of you be in danger. Those two groups will definitely clash with each other first outside. We'll use that opportunity to get away.

**Phoenix**<br>
This is a secret passage way that's connected to the sewer system. They will not discover this place. I've asked Ichiro to prepare a speedboat. We'll make our way to the transit station and escape to another Node.

**Kim**<br>
You are not going anywhere!

**Phoenix**<br>
...... Kim!

**Kim**<br>
Hehe...Eheeeheee! I knew it! You guys will try to escape through here...<br>
Didn't expect this, didn't ya? That stupid robot f\*\*\*ed up my entire left arm... Yet somehow I just can't die...

**Phoenix**<br>
So you survived... Kim, you're indeed a cockroach with how goddamn hard it is to kill you. Well, guess there isn't a more fitting place for your grave than this disgusting sewer, am I right!?

**Phoenix**<br>
ROBO, take Nora with you and run first...

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*... Understood.*

**Kim**<br>
All of you, stay the f\*\*\* why you are! You are all gonna die here!

**Phoenix**<br>
... Kim, this grudge is between you and me. Let them go.

**Kim**<br>
Huh!? What kind of stupid BS are you talking about!? That stinkin robot destroyed my left arm. That stupid brat exposed my plan. You made my life a heaping mess... and Manson Lam for blowing my right hand off! All of you will pay for what you did to me, right here, right now! Manson Lam ! Where the f\*\*\* are you!? Show yourself!! You c\*\*\*sucking son of a b\*\*\*! Ahahahaha EHehehehehe!!

*\[Gunshot\]*

**Phoenix**<br>
UGH! Run!

*[→Signal Switches]*

*\[Hurried Footsteps\]*

**Phoenix**<br>
Ha...! Ha......!

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Phoenix, gunshot wound in abdomen region. Potential damage to organs. Should apply emergency treatment right away.*

**Phoenix**<br>
Shut up... Keep running.

*\[Speedboat Engine\]*

**Member I**<br>
Director! Nora! Get on the boat!

**Phoenix**<br>
Ugh......! Ichiro, start the boat!

**[Nora]**<br>
*...... Phoenix?*

*\[Gunshot\]*

**Kim**<br>
Where are you hiding you bastards!? Come and get some you pieces of s\*\*\*! Ehe, ehe, Eheheheh! Ahahahaha!

**Phoenix**<br>
Quick... start the boat...

**Member I**<br>
Director!!<br>
......!? Yikes! You're badly injured...

**Phoenix**<br>
If you take me with you... you aren't getting very far away. Kim is harder to kill than a f\*\*\*\*\*\* cockroach... I have to finish him off myself, or he will never stop chasing you guys...

**Nora**<br>
......

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Let this unit... deal with Kim.*

**Phoenix**<br>
Have you taken a look at yourself?<br>
... ROBO, you are not created as a weapon to kill... Those EMP Armor\-piercing rounds Kim has, you've witnessed its power, haven't you? That thing's gonna tear you apart in seconds.

**[Nora]**<br>
*...... Phoenix......*

**Phoenix**<br>
Nora, your real name is...... [Shizuka Shiino]. Your birthday is 690 N.A., November 11th... When you reach Node 08, find a person by the name of "Noah Black". He was my subordinate when I was working at A.R.C. Take this new identity and go live a new life. I'm sure he will help you settle everything down...

**[Nora]**<br>
*...... Phoenix! No! Nora is my name! I......*

**Phoenix**<br>
... I... am not someone who's worthy of respect... The crimes I committed are too many to even properly count... However, after you came into my life... I finally realized... how despicable I used to be. I thought I can justify my actions by using "science" as a solid reasoning... but science was nothing more than an excuse I created so I don't have to accept what a horrible person I have become... It was thanks to you that I was finally able to remember the true purpose of my research... We humans have the power of "knowledge". That's why it's our duty to make the world a better place....... I've always wanted to let you live in a world like that... Now, it's up to you to create that world yourself...

*\[Gunshot\]*

**Kim**<br>
I, found, you\~\~

**Phoenix**<br>
ICHIRO! GO! NOW!!

**Member I**<br>
I... ARGGGGHHHHHH!!!!

*\[Speedboat Engine\]*

**[Nora]**<br>
*Phoenix！！！*

**Phoenix**<br>
I'm sorry... I was never a good father...
