**Kim**<br>
DAMNIT! Why!?

**Members**<br>
......

**Kim**<br>
Failed again... My calculations should be absolutely perfect...

**Member A**<br>
Brother Kim...

**Kim**<br>
Shut up! It's definitely because you guys screwed up!

**Member B**<br>
But we followed your orders for every step of the experiment...

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Phoenix**<br>
What's wrong?

**Member B**<br>
Ah, Boss...

**Phoenix**<br>
I told you not to call me Boss anymore.<br>
So, another failure, is it? ... Her legs are already starting to develop necrosis. I told you a long time ago that there is no chance for you to succeed on a specimen just three months old.

**Kim**<br>
F\*\*\*! Using this "Physical Enhancement" technology on adults is not just pointless, there's no challenge at all! <br>
One has to own this modification at all young age in order to realize its full potential! That's the whole point! Do you understand, you f\*\*\*\*\*\* moron?

**Phoenix**<br>
Hoho, talking the big talk now, aren't you? <br>
Should I give you a reminder about who rescued your sorry a\*\* from prison AND gave you the power to do whatever you want here? 

**Kim**<br>
... Tch.

**Phoenix**<br>
009... Wasn't this specimen just delivered here a few days ago? This is the ninth one already... Just because we gave you the budget doesn't mean you can go ahead and waste it like this.<br>
Mogura has been looking forward to the results of this project. Get your act together.

**Kim**<br>
Hmph, easy enough for you to say. After the facility was established, you've been doing nothing but studying "The Ender". Did you really think a research that couldn't be completed at A.R.C. will have even a slight chance in this s\*\*\*hole? Don't make me laugh...

*\[Equipment crashing\]*

**Kim**<br>
Ugh! Cough! Ak ak!!

**Members**<br>
......!

**Phoenix**<br>
I will not repeat myself again. Watch your mouth. If you p\*\*\* me off one more time, I will make sure that there are just seven Ravens left.

**Kim**<br>
I... I'm very sorry! Cough! Please let me go......

**Phoenix**<br>
Solving the mystery behind the virus is currently the entire organization... No, you can even say that it's the most important scientific breakthrough for humanity as a whole. We have ruins of human civilization all across this massive planet, yet right now our only way of life is to be locked inside the tiny Nodes and hang on for dear life. Have you ever wondered why?<br>
If we can allow the modern human race to expand our cultural significance to that of our " ancestors"...

**Kim**<br>
Cough cough......

**Phoenix**<br>
Forget it. For someone like you who's satisfied with your little toys, I'm casting pearls before swine.

**Phoenix**<br>
Physical Enhancement, you have to present something passable to Mogura in two months. If you can't, this side project will be handed off to someone else. I'm here to inform you this.

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Member A**<br>
Brother Kim... Are you alright?

**Kim**<br>
Leave me alone! Damnit...

**Members**<br>
......

**Kim**<br>
I don't get it! That bastard Phoenix produced nothing himself too, yet he's the only one who gets off scot\-free... F\*\*\*ing hell!

**Member B**<br>
As expected, it's way too difficult to produce results with just a dozen of us. We can ask the other Ravens for help...

**Kim**<br>
Shut up! Never in a million years! This is MY invention! Why should I share the glory with other people!?<br>
Discard 009 and other failed ones to the forbidden area. Tomorrow, we'll restart the experiments with 002.

**Member A**<br>
Okay...
