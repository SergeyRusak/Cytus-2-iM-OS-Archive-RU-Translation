**Member I**<br>
Huff...... Puff..... This way!

**Member I**<br>
Here, the ticket and the clearance pass are all here. Your Node 08 citizen ID should be completed before you arrive. Nora's ID will be "Shizuka Shiino". ROBO can clear the security check directly as Shizuka's proxy robot...<br>
Ah! But no matter what happens, don't let the law enforcement agents find out that you're an artificial intelligence; or else the security check process is gonna get really complicated!

**[Nora]**<br>
*... How about you, Ichiro?*

**Member I**<br>
Me? No, we only have tickets for you two. I'm not going.

**[Nora]**<br>
*You're staying here? You should leave with us!*

**Member I**<br>
I still need to take care of my grandmother. I can't just leave her here and go somewhere else.<br>
Besides, you don't need to worry. Mogura and Kyuu Hou Kai will definitely be victorious! The Hou Sang Tong people are no match for them!

**[Nora]**<br>
*... You assisted us in our escape. Mogura will not forgive you for that...*

**Member I**<br>
... Umm... Well... Where there's a will, there's always a way! Haha, don't worry about me!

**Nora**<br>
......

**Member I**<br>
Alright. Mogura has informed the entire Administration Bureau. People will catch up with us anytime now. You better get moving!

**[Nora]**<br>
*But...*

**Member I**<br>
JUST LEAVE YOU BASTARDS...!!

**Nora**<br>
!?

**Member I**<br>
Director is dead! His final wish is for me to see you guys off safely!! So F\*\*\* OFF!!<br>


**[Nora]**<br>
*Ichiro...*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*This unit, understands. Ichiro, goodbye.<br>
...... Thank you.*

**Member I**<br>
Farewell, you big stinkin robot...

**[Nora]**<br>
*ROBO, when you see this message, it means you've already arrived at Node 08. I'm sorry... I couldn't go there with you.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*As long as you are with me, Mogura will definitely follow us there as well, no matter where we hide... The folks at Mogura want to dispose of you. You'll never be truly safe with them constantly chasing you.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*I, on the other hand, still have a lot of value to them. I am very certain that they won't harm me. Therefore, I decide to stay here and use my ability as a bargaining chip to persuade them to no longer hold you responsible for what you did.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*Ever since I created you, so many things have happened... We created music together. We talked with each other. We played games... Whether it was the good or the bad, you were always there by my side. The time I spent with you... was truly some of the happiest times in my life. Thank you.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*ROBO, you are a very special existence... Much more than just a simple A.I. You have your own emotions, your own soul that was birthed from the database that is me——Nora.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*Do you remember what I told you before? The spirit, the mind, the memories... All of them are proof that a "human" once existed. Therefore, for someone who inherited all of the above from me, you are the proof of my existence.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*So, please, go pursue "your own" freedom and dreams... If you do that, it's like you're pursuing my freedom and my dreams.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*I have reconfigured your supreme command. From now on, protecting me is no longer your reason to live. I also forbid you from returning to Node 03.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*On behalf of me, experience more happy things. Let more people hear our music. Learn even more things... Go live a life that you've yearned for. This is something you deserve.*

*\[Platform announcement\]*

**[Platform Announcement]**<br>
*The train is about to depart. For passengers who haven't board the train, please proceed to take other trains. Thank you for your cooperation*

**[Nora]**<br>
*.... Goodbye, ROBO\_Head.*
