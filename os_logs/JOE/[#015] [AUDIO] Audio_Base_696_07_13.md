**Saxon**<br>
Last one, all done.

**JOE**<br>
Uh\-huh.

**Saxon**<br>
... You are not your usual cheery self today. What's wrong?

**JOE**<br>
Nothing.

**JOE**<br>
......

**Saxon**<br>
... Something did happen, didn't it? What happened? Tell me about it!

**JOE**<br>
... Are you trying to read my mind? <br>
Nothing much; it's just that our band disbanded.

**Saxon**<br>
Disbanded? What happened? You guys had an argument?

**JOE**<br>
Umm... the situation is... complicated. I myself haven't digested the info properly too.

**Saxon**<br>
Do you want to tell me about it?

**JOE**<br>
Yeah...

**Saxon**<br>
... Come up here. Pops will treat you to a drink.

**JOE**<br>
... They are all good people and are serious about making a splash in the music world... Perhaps I'm the only one who treated it as just something fun. Whatever, it's all over now. I'll probably never see them again, ever.

**Saxon**<br>
Do not look down on yourself. For Crystal PuNK, every single member is crucial, including you. Without any one of you, the band will not be the same. That's why you guys chose to disband instead of finding replacements.

**Saxon**<br>
Having played music with such wonderful friends, you are already much more fortunate than many others.

**JOE**<br>
......

**Saxon**<br>
Let's listen to some music. Rock? Metal? Some Shredding...

**JOE**<br>
No... something slower.

**Saxon**<br>
... Then how about this one?

*\[Music\]*

**JOE**<br>
... Ah...

**Saxon**<br>
When you were still a kid, you stood there playing this very song. That was the first time you finished this song, remember?

**JOE**<br>
Yes.

**Zark**<br>
Arf!

**JOE**<br>
... Such a good song. Zark, do you think so too?

**Zark**<br>
Arf Arf!

**Saxon**<br>
... We don't get to drink together often. Another one?

**JOE**<br>
Yeah...

*\[Cheers\]*

**JOE**<br>
*\*Gulp!\* \*Sniff\* \*Sobs\**......

**Saxon**<br>
Oh? So you're the type who cries when drunk?

**JOE**<br>
I wanted to cry back when I was talking with KAI about this. I don't want him to think that I'm a sissy... but I really don't want it to end! We had become such good friends! We are hosting a music festival at the end of the year too!

**Saxon**<br>
Who told you that crying means you're a sissy? Crying is what turns you into a man. So go ahead and cry. Remember, tears and laughs are the best ingredients for any good music.

**JOE**<br>
*\*Sobs!\** Shut it... old man! *\*Sobs\**...

**Saxon**<br>
Man, if you can't hold your liquor well, how can I entrust this shop to you?

**JOE**<br>
What... entrust...

**Saxon**<br>
... Knocked out already? Too young, too young.
