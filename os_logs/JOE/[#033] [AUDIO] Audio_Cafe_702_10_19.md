**[News]**<br>
*...after six months of investigation, the special ops team of Node 08's law enforcement department launched a cleanup blitz yesterday. 16 suspects were arrested in Quadrant III and IV. Of the suspects, notorious pedophiles are among the criminals arrested...*

**JOE**<br>
Ha... The case is solved... Nice one, Simon!

*\[Turns off TV\]*

*\[Doorbell\]*

**JOE**<br>
Hello, handsome; we're already closed for the day...<br>
......!

**Diego**<br>
I know. That's why I chose to come in at this time.

**JOE**<br>
......

**Diego**<br>
It has been a long time since I was here for a drink, JOE.

**JOE**<br>
Diego...

**Diego**<br>
What's wrong? Your face has "nervous" written all over it.

**JOE**<br>
... Martini?

**Diego**<br>
No, why would you ask that? There aren't any transactions lately, right?<br>
Give me a Tequila.

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

*\[Glass slides\]*

**Diego**<br>
I haven't talked to you about this, haven't I? I was born in Node 07. There, this type of liquor is a local specialty. I've developed a liking for it since I was eight and that liking has remained to this day.

**JOE**<br>
......

**Diego**<br>
Afterward, I arrived at Node 03, joined Mogura, then I came here to control the Baro Brotherhood.<br>
The world around me is always changing. The only thing that will never betray me is Tequila. This taste will always be what it is.

**JOE**<br>
What do you want to say?

**Diego**<br>
Nothing. I'm at that age already; I get nostalgic sometimes.<br>
Speaking of Mogura... Node 03 has been a huge mess these days. You got the information, haven't you?

**JOE**<br>
I saw it on the news. Something about a major explosion.

**Diego**<br>
The news? Haha, if that's all the owner of JOEZ Cafe knows, the great UNCLE \- Saxon will be so disappointed he'll rise from his grave and punch you in the face.

**JOE**<br>
... You want information about the explosion? You travel to 03 more often than me, right? Isn't it faster for you to go there yourself?

**Diego**<br>
Due to the previous transaction, I can't leave here in the near future. I've gotten wind of a news that several Node 03 law enforcement agents will be at 08 for the next two days to do business. You figure out a way to get them to Cafe and see if you can squeeze some info out of them.

**JOE**<br>
... Sure. That's not hard.

**Diego**<br>
I'll let you handle it. The reward will be included in the next Martini.

**JOE**<br>
......OK.

*\[Drinks\]*

**Diego**<br>
I mentioned just now that I'm a nostalgic person. Seeing the explosion incident brings back memory of an old friend who used to be there.<br>
Have you ever heard the name "Manson Lam"?

**JOE**<br>
Of course. Former head of the Node 03 Administration Bureau, scientist, as well as Mogura's second\-in\-command. Well\-known for being a sharpshooter ... He died a few years ago...

**Diego**<br>
You could say that we two admire each other. Unfortunately, when he got caught up in an incident and died, I was already in Node 08...<br>
He helped Boss Minatsuki create Mogura and made it the largest force to be reckoned with in Node 03. He even allowed the Baro Brotherhood to sneak into Node 08 and thrive. He was one heck of a man.

**JOE**<br>
Ho... so you're worried about your old friend's organization? <br>
You don't seem to be that considerate of a person.

**Diego**<br>
You can look at it that way.<br>
I'm done with my drink. I shall take my leave.

**JOE**<br>
Walk yourself out.

*\[Doorbell\]*

**Diego**<br>
... Right, one more thing.<br>
Rumor has it that one of our customers got arrested by the admins... He had a couple "Devil Puppet" transactions with us.

**JOE**<br>
......

**Diego**<br>
Baro Brotherhood has performed a complete investigation. No one leaked any information...<br>
Perhaps some men leaked some other things while they're being tortured...<br>
Forget it. That guy is a downstream customer, no better than human trash. I don't have the time to deal with this issue.

**JOE**<br>
......

**Diego**<br>
However, as long as such a leak exists in the organization, it's my duty to figure out the details.<br>
JOE, do you know how the former boss and Liang died?

**JOE**<br>
... Betrayed by someone in their own organization?

**Diego**<br>
Haha, I'll count your answer as half\-correct.<br>
The correct answer is, betrayed by me. That's how I was able to climb to the top. In other words, I am very aware of how this thing called "Trust" works in our world.

**JOE**<br>
......

**Diego**<br>
The method I used back then... is also why I'm paying so much attention to the 03 explosion incident this time. If I can understand this incident, perhaps it won't take me long to figure who is "screwing around" within the organization.

**JOE**<br>
......

**Diego**<br>
All things consider, I hope that the next time we meet, I'll still be drinking Tequila instead of being here for something else.<br>
Adios...

*\[Doorbell\]*

**JOE**<br>
... Hah~...

**JOE**<br>
Zark... please, give me courage... please...
