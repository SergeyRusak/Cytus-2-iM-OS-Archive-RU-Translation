JOE.

**JOE**<br>
So it was you! How come you didn't tell me that you're coming!

**Saxon**<br>
Didn't want to give you pressure.<br>
The performance was good. The song you wrote was great.

**JOE**<br>
Hahaha! Thanks! Just like you said; the feeling is so awesome!

**Saxon**<br>
The crowd is so packed that it reached the exit. The ticket sales must be pretty good, right?

**JOE**<br>
Super good! If we calculate based on the rent this time, the profit alone is more than enough to hold two more sessions. Did you have a crowd this big when you're performing?

**Saxon**<br>
We didn't even have a Live House the size of Under Velvet back then.

**JOE**<br>
Hahaha... If we can keep this up, a few more sessions and I will have enough for a brand\-new effects unit. Pops, are you interested in sponsoring me?

**Saxon**<br>
We'll see about it. Set aside the money stuff, how does it feel performing on stage?

**JOE**<br>
It was SOOO amazing! Even though I screwed up a lot haha.

**Saxon**<br>
Can't help it. You can practice your skills anywhere, but the cheering and attention you received from the audience is something you can't experience at home.

**JOE**<br>
Indeed. Man, what should I do now; I want to perform again right now!

**Saxon**<br>
No need to worry. From what your band showcased today, it won't be a long time. Trust me; this is a prophecy from the true BASS god of Quadrant III.

**JOE**<br>
Woah, why are your words so kind today... feels creepy. Thanks a lot for coming though! Is everything ok back at the bar?

**Saxon**<br>
I closed it to come to hear your performance. However, have work later tonight. I have to go.

**JOE**<br>
Then I'll collect my stuff and go back with you too...

**Saxon**<br>
No need for that. You guys still have to celebrate and discuss your performance, right? Don't waste your time on an old man like me.

**Saxon**<br>
Remember... enjoy these times as much as you can.

**JOE**<br>
Huh?

**Saxon**<br>
Listen, when I look at you, I see my younger self. In the future, you will begin to shoulder more responsibility... Cherish these experiences right now, as they will be a memory you recall when that time comes.

**JOE**<br>
What the... why are you telling me this now?

**Saxon**<br>
Nothing. Remember to call your mother if you're going to stay out late at night. I'll be leaving now.

**JOE**<br>
Got it. See ya pops!
