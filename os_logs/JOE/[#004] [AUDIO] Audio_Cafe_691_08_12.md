**Saxon**<br>
So you're here?

**JOE**<br>
We're talking about money, of course I'm here! What are we carrying this time?

**Saxon**<br>
No need to rush now.<br>
Here, have a drink.

**JOE**<br>
... Milk?

**Saxon**<br>
What? You want booze? Wait another year, you lil' brat.<br>
... It's been several months since you started helping me, right?

**JOE**<br>
Woah, serious talk isn't it... I guess so.

**Saxon**<br>
You've made yourself a decent fortune these days. You should understand what this "work" is all about now.

**JOE**<br>
I know, I know. Contact sellers for the customers, look over the products for them, then wait for them to come pick it up.

**Saxon**<br>
More or less. Those products are not illegal but are hard to obtain. The customers' identities are also rather obscure. That's why my social network is required in these transactions.

**JOE**<br>
No wonder they are super respectful of you.

**Saxon**<br>
Sort of. Besides transactions, I sometimes provide other assistances. For example, leading customers to specific locations.

**JOE**<br>
So basically a tour guide. Why don't they go there themselves?

**Saxon**<br>
Because they don't know how... in fact, most of the customers come from Node 03.

**JOE**<br>
That really messed up place? Your social network really is wide and expansive.

**Saxon**<br>
.... Being naive is not a bad thing. Here, take this paper.

**Zark**<br>
Arf\-arf! Arf\-arf!

**JOE**<br>
Hey Zark! Knock it off, don't bite it... what is this, an address?

**Saxon**<br>
When the customers arrive in a minute, you help me lead the way. Escort everyone to the location on the paper. Once they reached the location, you come back to me, I pay you the money. Simple enough?

**JOE**<br>
Are you treating me like a guide dog? I feel like this is a job for Zark...

**Saxon**<br>
I will pay you double.

**JOE**<br>
I'm going to wait for the customers outside!

**Saxon**<br>
What's with the hurry? Finish your milk before you go!

**JOE**<br>
Give it to Zark! Only idiots drink milk in a bar!

*\[Doorbell\]*

**Saxon**<br>
You little brat... Zark's gonna get diarrhea if you give him this stuff.

**Zark**<br>
Arf?
