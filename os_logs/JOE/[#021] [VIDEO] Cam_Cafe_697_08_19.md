**Diego**<br>
Good stuff. Exactly the same as the one Saxon made.

**JOE**<br>
......

**Diego**<br>
You seem to be very cautious towards me.<br>
Please, relax. I'm one of your uncle's old friends as well.

**JOE**<br>
I've never seen you before.

**Diego**<br>
Your uncle wasn't exactly welcoming to me... Our ideals are a bit... different. However, he's a great man. He dedicated his entire life for all of us. He deserves all the respect he got.

**JOE**<br>
But Boss Luo and other are...

**Diego**<br>
Yes, the top members of the Ando gang getting arrested has made everyone very nervous. I have a meeting with a few old friends later today.<br>
... However, I feel like the talk with you deserves priority, so I came here first.

**JOE**<br>
With me...? I was the one who f\*\*\*ed up and got Boss Luo and Co. busted... The thing uncle's been carefully maintaining...

**Diego**<br>
Balance, right?

**JOE**<br>
... Yes.

**Diego**<br>
Saxon did a lot of things for everyone. The three gangs benefited greatly from him and were able to thrive together. Despite our differences, I also hold a deep respect for your uncle.

**JOE**<br>
......

**Diego**<br>
However, JOE, an opportunity now rests in your hands... one that allows both us and the entire gang business to take a big step forward.

**JOE**<br>
A big step forward?

**Diego**<br>
The Ando gang is now in disarray. This very night, the Baro Brotherhood is the biggest organization still operating. So, naturally, we have to do something for everyone. To do so, we need to prepare a large amount of resources and information... a lot more than anything in the past.

**JOE**<br>
Umm, and then?

**Diego**<br>
I feel like you should realize this as well... Why do you think I specifically made the trip here?

**JOE**<br>
Aren't you here for a drink?

**Diego**<br>
Indeed, for this "Martini".

**JOE**<br>
... OH! You mean this!

**Diego**<br>
JOEZ Cafe's ability to collect resources and information surpasses that of the three gangs combined. When Saxon was still alive, he only allowed transactions in the grey area... but now, we have even more options.

**JOE**<br>
But pops did that because...

**Diego**<br>
To maintain the balance between the gangs. That's why he didn't get involved with illegal businesses. I know.<br>
... Yet the balance no longer exists anymore.

**JOE**<br>
Umm...

**Diego**<br>
JOE, the gangs are facing a very tough situation. However, a crisis is also an opportunity. As long as you work with me, not only can we recreate the glory days, but we can also receive even greater benefits... you, me, every gang organization in Node 08, all of us.

**JOE**<br>
I... get benefits as well?

**Diego**<br>
... Certainly. <br>
In the past, the price of this Martini is ten percent of the transaction amount, correct?

**JOE**<br>
Yes. A price set by pops. Hasn't changed in decades.

**Diego**<br>
I give you double.

**JOE**<br>
!?

**Diego**<br>
If you agree to lift the limitations, for future Baro Brotherhood transactions, you get twenty percent. What do you think?

**JOE**<br>
......

**Diego**<br>
Don't pull a long face. I'm asking you a question.

**JOE**<br>
... Twenty\-five.

**Diego**<br>
... What?

**JOE**<br>
I want one\-fourth of the transaction amount...!

**Diego**<br>
Hoho... hahaha! Boy! I knew you wouldn't disappoint me!<br>
Alright! One\-fourth it is!

**JOE**<br>
To celebrate our future partnership, a toast?

**Diego**<br>
Of course! I'm beginning to like you even more, boy!

*\[Cheers\]*

**Zark**<br>

**Zark**<br>
Arooo...
