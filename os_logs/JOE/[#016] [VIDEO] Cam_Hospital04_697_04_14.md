**JOE**<br>
Hi\~ How are you doing today?

**Saxon**<br>
The doctor said I can have one drink today.

**JOE**<br>
Then drink my p\*\*\*, you drunkard. Getting hospitalized because of a heart attack, I was scared s\*\*\*less you know!

**Saxon**<br>
No need to worry, death won't take me down that easily... is Zark doing well?

**JOE**<br>
He's much healthier than you, so no probs. I did visit the shop to feed him before I came here.

**Saxon**<br>
Thanks for the help.

**JOE**<br>
Don't say that. You're a patient, ya know?

**Saxon**<br>
......

**JOE**<br>
... Here, apples.

**Saxon**<br>
Your knife skills have improved a lot.

**JOE**<br>
Of course! I've been practicing it every day while preparing the ingredients. I've learned over half of the cocktail recipes too.

**Saxon**<br>
By that, I'm assuming that you have agreed to my proposal. When is the sign going to change?

**JOE**<br>
Scheduled to be next week. But, um... what's with the "JOEZ Cafe" name? It's kinda embarrassing...

**Saxon**<br>
It's your shop; of course it's going to bear your name.<br>
I want you to take care of this shop just like yourself. Also, don't worry your mother.

**JOE**<br>
We're just a bar selling booze...

**Saxon**<br>
... JOE, I told you many times before. This bar is not just about selling booze.

**JOE**<br>
Yes, yes... the "Underground Balance" thing, I get it.

**Saxon**<br>
Do not underestimate it. For many years, the gangs of Node 08 are able to maintain balance, thrive together with each other and not harm regular civilians till this very day. The reason for that is because of the service we provide. Do you understand? Cafe plays a very important role in this.

**JOE**<br>
... Assist gangs in their transaction, yet insists on not taking part in illegal businesses. I can't really understand why. Is it a moral thing? Or is it just personal taste?

**Saxon**<br>
Neither. I did so because it's the only effective method.

**JOE**<br>
Huh?

**Saxon**<br>
There is no absolute black or white in this world. We are all different tints of grey, carefully traversing between the light and the shadow. Those who go for the extremes are often too much for the regular folks to accept. However, as long as some rules are in place, those who walk on the edge can live on with their head held high too.

**JOE**<br>
You mean... the gangs are not really the bad guys?

**Saxon**<br>
What I mean is, we have the ability to not let gangs become something truly evil.

**JOE**<br>
With this shop?

**Saxon**<br>
And you.

**JOE**<br>
... Alright. But even if everything you said is accurate, would those guys actually listen to me?

**Saxon**<br>
Of course not. Do you know which gangs are in Node 08?

**JOE**<br>
The largest one is Ando, then Baro; the smallest is Cino...

**Saxon**<br>
Besides these, Node 03's "Mogura (土竜)" and "Kyuu Hou Kai (玖凰會)" also has operations over here. Let me tell you, those are the real big boys.

**JOE**<br>
You seem to know a lot about all of them...

**Saxon**<br>
Yes. This is the answer: make friends.

**JOE**<br>
Hoho, then I'm really good at that!

**Saxon**<br>
... There are still exceptions, though. For example, the Baro Brotherhood has been constantly trying to break the balance. I just never gave them the opportunity.

**JOE**<br>
Oh...

**Saxon**<br>
Don't just think about being friends with everybody. You must always be alerted. One little slip\-up... the consequences will be unimaginable. There are also some people that you must pay extra attention to.

**JOE**<br>
Like whom...?

**Saxon**<br>
I'll gradually tell them to you once we have the time. No need to worry, as long as you don't get involved with illegal businesses, they won't be able to touch this shop if you bring up my name.

**JOE**<br>
Umm... hmm... alright.

**Saxon**<br>
Also, take good care of your mother.

**JOE**<br>
Of course I will. Why did this pop up all of a sudden?

**Saxon**<br>
... Just something that came to my mind. Any more questions about this job?

**JOE**<br>
... One last question. What did you spend your entire life doing this? Maintaining the balance between the gangs... what benefit does this bring you?

**Saxon**<br>
.... Wait till the day I pour you my last glass of booze, then we can talk about it.
