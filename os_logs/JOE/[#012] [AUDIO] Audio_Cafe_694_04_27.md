**JOE**<br>
Hello, I'm JOE...

**Angus**<br>
I know who you are. Is the cargo here yet?

**JOE**<br>
Um, not yet... Ah! It's that truck, right?

**Hunter**<br>
Capo, I've got the cargo. So you're JOE? Open the basement gate; we'll get the cargo down there right away.

**JOE**<br>
Got it! No probs!

**Angus**<br>
Any issues?

**Hunter**<br>
Nothing. Everything went very smoothly.

**Angus**<br>
Open it. I want to check.

*\[Back door opens\]*

**Hunter**<br>
......

**Angus**<br>
Hey, why is there so much dirt underneath here?

**Hunter**<br>
Huh? Oh... the air conditioning in the car broke down on the way, so I opened the windows. Maybe that's why...

**Angus**<br>
... Open the crate.

**Hunter**<br>
Umm... the buyer specifically told us that we are not allowed to look inside before...

**Angus**<br>
I said open the damn crate! I'm going to check what's inside. If you let me repeat one more time, I'll use your ear as an ashtray.

*\[Unlocks crate\]*

**Angus**<br>
... Hey, what the heck is this all about?

**Hunter**<br>
Umm... I'm so sorry! The fact is, we ran into a little accident on the way here. But I can promise, the cargo was not damaged! It just got a little bit of smudge on it! <br>
It's true! I swear!

**Angus**<br>
Uh\-huh, I get it.

**Hunter**<br>
......

**Angus**<br>
You can close it now.

**Hunter**<br>
Ummm... O, okay.

*\[Punch\]*

**Hunter**<br>
Blargh! Ughhhh...

**JOE**<br>
HOLY!

**Angus**<br>
......

*\[Punch\]*

**Hunter**<br>
Awk! Capo, I'm sorry...

**Angus**<br>
Hmm? Why are you apologizing?

*\[Punch\]*

**Hunter**<br>
I damaged the cargo! I damaged the cargo!

**Angus**<br>
Hmm? Didn't you say that it was not damaged? I also think it just got a little bit of smudge on it, just like your f\*\*\*\*\* face!

*\[Punch\]*

**JOE**<br>
Hey! Are you trying to beat him to death?

**Angus**<br>
Is the gate opened yet?

**JOE**<br>
It is opened. Umm...

**Angus**<br>
Then shut up. Another noise from you and your face will look like his.

**Angus**<br>
Mad Dog, be grateful that I can cover up your s\*\*\* this time with just a few punches. If you dare to have this attitude again on the next delivery, Diego will deal with you himself; and he's not exactly a kind soul like me. Capiche?

**Hunter**<br>
Yes...

**JOE**<br>
......

**Angus**<br>
Hey, s\*\*\*head, leave this piece of trash here. You watch over the cargo with every f\*\*\*\*\* thing you have. I'll go get the buyer now. Before that, clean up the cargo so that it looks good as new. <br>
Also, about the accident this idiot here caused, no leaks to anyone, get it?

**JOE**<br>
What accident?

**Angus**<br>
Smart kid.
