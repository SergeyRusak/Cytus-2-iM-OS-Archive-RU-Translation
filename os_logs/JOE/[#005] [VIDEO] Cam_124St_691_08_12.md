**Wang**<br>
Good... I dare you to repeat that s\*\*\* again!

**Fang**<br>
Idiot, your lack of brains is why you've been stuck in your position all these years.

**JOE**<br>
Eheheh, what the heck is going on?<br>
Wasn't everything fine beforehand? How come I went to take a p\*\*\* and now you two are trying to bash each other's head in?

**Fang**<br>
None of your business, now get out of the way.

**Wang**<br>
Hey, you. Take that out.

**Crew Member**<br>
Eh? Are we using it here?

**Fang**<br>
Ha! That's why I said you lack brains! Did you even think about the consequences of using cargo for private purposes!?

**Wang**<br>
Shut your damn mouth. I'll blow your sorry a\*\* to kingdom come, then say it was a trigger accident.

**Fang**<br>
I advise you to shut up before I send one right through that blockhead of yours...

**JOE**<br>
THE FIRSSSTTT~~~~ EVARRRRR~~~~ GUNSLINGER SHOWDOWN!!!!

**Fang、Wang、Crew Member**<br>
……！？

**JOE**<br>
Everybody's connected to the internet, right? Gimme a sec, I'll set up the room.

**Wang**<br>
... What are you talking about?

**JOE**<br>
Done! Let's see... 1 vs 1 Deathmatch between you two, select.

**Fang**<br>
Woah! A gun appeared...

**Wang**<br>
What the heck are these?

**JOE**<br>
You guys don't know? This is an AR shooter that's all the rage on cyTus these days. First one to 50 kills wins.

**Wang**<br>
Hey! You really think a child's game like this can...

**[Game notification]**<br>
*Headshot! First Blood!*

**Fang**<br>
Ahahaha! Holy S\*\*\*! His head exploded! The effects are sick!

**Wang**<br>
OWW!

**JOE**<br>
Capo Wang, even though it's a game, it hurts like s\*\*\* when you get hit.<br>
I've cranked up the immersion to max. If you get hit consecutively, you're gonna faint from the pain.

**Wang**<br>
Hmph! Nonsense!

**[Game notification]**<br>
*Headshot!*

**Fang**<br>
That's two points for me. If I win, you better shut your damn mouth for now on.

**Wang**<br>
F\*\*\* you! Die! Die, you son of a b\*\*\*\*!!!

**Crew Member**<br>
T... they really started playing...

**JOE**<br>
Hey! I've added all you guys to the observer mode. Come, place your bets! Press the UI on your arm and the choices will appear. I accept both C coins and cash! But, I will take 15 percent commission.

**Crew Member**<br>
Hey, this seems quite interesting... 10 grand for capo Wang!

**Crew Member**<br>
20 grand for capo Fang!

**Crew Member**<br>
20 grand for capo Wang!

**Fang**<br>
Hey, you bastards! I'm in the lead; why is everyone placing bets on Wang?

**JOE**<br>
His odds are higher. If he wins in the end, those who bet on him will get a boatload of money.

**Fang**<br>
HA! Interesting!

**JOE**<br>
Hoho~ this way, we keep the cargo intact, nobody gets hurt, and I make some quick dough.<br>
Haha! I'm such a genius!
