**Zark**<br>
Arf arf! Arf!

**Xenon**<br>
.....

**Customer**<br>
Oh? An unfamiliar face... does this count as a face?

**Xenon**<br>
... Hello.

**Customer**<br>
Have a seat. The owner went to take a s\*\*\*, haha.

**Zark**<br>
ARF!

**JOE**<br>
Why the hell are you barking, stupid dog? What, a customer? Welcome, helmet guy. First time here?

**Xenon**<br>
JOE!?

**JOE**<br>
Huh? Do we know each other?

*\[Removes Helmet\]*

**Xenon**<br>
Do you know now?

**JOE**<br>
JASUS! Simon!? Why are you here!?

**Xenon**<br>
Just happen to pass by here. Came in out of pure curiosity.

**Customer**<br>
Your friend?

**JOE**<br>
He's the guitarist of my old band! <br>
I mentioned him before! Where the f\*\*\* did you disappear to though? It's been years!

**Xenon**<br>
Umm, it's a long story...

**JOE**<br>
Take a seat first. Why are you standing there? Haha.

**Xenon**<br>
Sure... pretty nice shop you've got here. Did you open this yourself?

**JOE**<br>
I inherited this shop from my uncle.<br>
Ah, right. You've never been here before. I did some renovation. What do you think?

**Xenon**<br>
It is quite nice. I was lured inside by the music and the exterior decoration. <br>
Of course, that suspicious sign also helped... your horrible naming sense might be the only major flop.

**JOE**<br>
My uncle was the one who came up with the name! He wants me to treat this shop like myself and take good care of it.

**Xenon**<br>
Too bad you're someone who can barely take care of yourself properly...<br>
Right, Zark? It's been a long time.

**Zark**<br>
Ruff ruff ruff... Arf!

**JOE**<br>
Dude, maybe he doesn't remember you at all. Be careful; he might chomp you if you touch him in the wrong place.

**Xenon**<br>
You're the only person he bites though?

**JOE**<br>
Aha, that's it! Your super sharp verbal jabs! Damn do I miss them!

**Xenon**<br>
Haha... Are you still playing in a band now?

**JOE**<br>
Never since. Not long after we disbanded, my uncle died and left me with this shop.<br>
I've been working my a\*\* off operating this place. I don't have the time.

**Xenon**<br>
I'm sorry...

**JOE**<br>
Nothing to be sorry about, all things from a long time ago. Bro, you have no idea how happy I am seeing you again! <br>
Here, order a drink! It's on me!

**Xenon**<br>
You know that I don't drink alcohol, right?

**JOE**<br>
Huhhhh? Is this how you apologize for your past actions?

**Xenon**<br>
... Didn't you just say there's nothing to be sorry about?

**JOE**<br>
Haha, I know, I know. Just make an order, soft stuff is fine too.

**Xenon**<br>
Soft?

**JOE**<br>
It means non\-alcoholic drinks.

**Xenon**<br>
Um, milk?

**JOE**<br>
Puhahaha, in the long history of this shop, this may be the first time we see "milk" on a receipt! Puhahahahaha!

**Xenon**<br>
... Shut up.

**JOE**<br>
It's probably not gonna be the last time though?

**Xenon**<br>
Probably.
