**JOE**<br>
Look! I have everything set up!

**Saxon**<br>
Alright, set up the music stand here...

**JOE**<br>
No need for that! Yours truly here have memorized the entire thing already!

**Saxon**<br>
You're way too young to be calling yourself "yours truly"... alright then, let's begin.

**JOE**<br>
No probs!

*[»»» Fast Forward »»»]*

**JOE**<br>
Ehhh... do this here...

**Saxon**<br>
Seems a bit different from what I taught you?

**JOE**<br>
Ah, it's this string...

*[»»» Fast Forward »»»]*

**JOE**<br>
Uhhhh...

**Saxon**<br>
Your fingering is off. I'll teach you one more time...

**JOE**<br>
Nah pops, I got this!

**Saxon**<br>
... Then try again.

*[»»» Fast Forward »»»]*

**Saxon**<br>
That's right, just like this. Don't stop, keep going.

*[»»» Fast Forward »»»]*

**Saxon**<br>
Your fingers are too stiff. Don't forget: sway your body, feel the music.

*[»»» Fast Forward »»»]*

**JOE**<br>
Hehe, hehehehe...

**Saxon**<br>
Yes, smile. Music is like good wine. You need to enjoy it with ease and to the fullest. Only then can you truly perform music with soul.

*[»»» Fast Forward »»»]*

**JOE**<br>
Whew, I finished! Yeah!

**Saxon**<br>
Not bad. However, your pinky finger is not flexible enough. Are you doing your scale exercises properly? That's the most basic skill, you must practice it every day.

**JOE**<br>
Of course I did\~ You never believe me, even though I'm such a good boy!

**Saxon**<br>
I will believe you once you show me some results. One more time?

**JOE**<br>
Again? How about you have a go!

**Saxon**<br>
For what? You're the one who's learning how to play BASS.

**JOE**<br>
If you don't practice, I will be as good as you in no time. Then you will have nothing to teach me!

**Saxon**<br>
Hoho... you really think you can catch up with the BASS god of Quadrant III...

**JOE**<br>
If you're really that godly, then show me! Come on, come on...

**Saxon**<br>
... Alright; give me the BASS. I'll show you a glimpse of a true master at work.

**JOE**<br>
YEAH! Love ya so much, pops! Here, now hurry!
