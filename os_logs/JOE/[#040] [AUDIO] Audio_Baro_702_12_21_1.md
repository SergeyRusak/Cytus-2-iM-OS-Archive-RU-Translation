**Hunter**<br>
What the f\*\*\* are you arguing about!?

**Fang**<br>
... Hunter, calm down.

**Hunter**<br>
Oh, shut your piehole! <br>
Hey, what are you pieces of crap doing here all of a sudden?

**Zheng**<br>
Quit barking, Mad Dog. Everybody heard about what happened to Diego. We're here to ask for an explanation.

**Hunter**<br>
Ex\-Explanation? What explanation?

**Zheng**<br>
Your entire branch in 03 was f\*\*\*\*\* annihilated and Diego's brains exploded into a bigger bloom than a goddamn sunflower, no? This ain't no resting in peace. Who's Baro feuding with? Will it affect the other gangs? You better give me an explanation.

**Hunter**<br>
Uhh...

**Lai**<br>
Brother, that's not all! Some of our boys were also in the branch that was destroyed. Baro was the one that forced us to send people there. How are you gonna take responsibility for that?

**Hunter**<br>
Responsibility my a\*\*! Most of the guys killed were ours!

**Fang**<br>
Hunter!<br>
Sorry, Brother Zheng. We're doing our best to investigate it right now...

**Zheng**<br>
We're really sorry about what happened to Diego. However, he was making everyone take on work that overstepped certain boundaries. It caused the public reputation of us gangs to become worse and worse. And now, he even got himself involved with those drones that caused all that chaos... He lost his life because of that, didn't he?

**Hunter**<br>
All this pointless yapping. You think I'm stupid or what?

**Zheng**<br>
Hmph, so the Mad Dog doesn't understand human language, huh? Then let me be clear... Our organizations are leaving the control of the Baro Brotherhood. From now on, you stay out of our way and we'll stay out of yours.

**Hunter**<br>
You piece of...!

**Fang**<br>
... Brother Zheng, you don't have to do this.<br>
Without the support of Baro, with the power and resources you have now, there's no way you'll survive...

**Lai**<br>
And why do you think that's the case? Because you Baro bastards took them away from us!

**Zheng**<br>
Lai, stop it.<br>
We were able to make it work 20 years ago. Right now, we're merely starting over again. This situation with the drones is serious. If we just contribute our strength and help out the victims, then we'll naturally carve out a new way to survive.

**Fang**<br>
... I don't oppose that, but Diego unified the gangs so people like me, who were abandoned by society since youth, can get some respect without the need to rely on normal people to get by...

**Zheng**<br>
Fang... you've been in the gangs since you were a child. I understand how you feel... You entered Baro to protect yourself, but you don't entirely agree with Diego's methods. We don't even need to mention this dumb mutt, obviously...

*\[Fists Flying\]*

**Zheng**<br>
Oof!

**Lai**<br>
Brother Zheng!

**Hunter**<br>
Who said you could keep talking!?

**Fang**<br>
Hunter!? What the hell are you...

**Hunter**<br>
Listen carefully, you pieces of s\*\*\*! Diego might not be here, but Baro's men and guns still outnumber all you little s\*\*\*shows combined by a country mile! Fang, ain't that right!!?

**Fang**<br>
……

**Zheng**<br>
Tch...

**Hunter**<br>
Get it straight. The lives of you worthless craps belong to Baro! You wanna leave? Great! You'll soon find out whether or not you can do business without me finding out about it!

**Lai**<br>
Damnit... are you threatening us?

**Hunter**<br>
Yeah, I am threatening you f\*\*\*s! You got a problem!?

**Fang**<br>
... Hunter! They're our elders...

**Hunter**<br>
*\*spit\**...! So what? What the hell is there to discuss with the boss of a has\-been gang like that? You think just cuz Diego died, you are free to leave? Bulls\*\*\*! If you wanna live longer, you better listen and listen good!

**Fang**<br>
……

*\[Door Knock\]*

**???**<br>
Yo, can I come inside?

**Gang Member**<br>
You kidding? Course not! The bosses are discussing serious stuff...

**???**<br>
Oh, so I made it in time? Wonderful.

**Fang**<br>
......?

**Hunter**<br>
Wha the hell's going on outside!?

*\[Door Opens\]*

**JOE**<br>
Long time no see, guys. Ooh, everyone's here.<br>
... My information was right on the money after all.

**Hunter**<br>
S\*\*\*head!?

**Fang**<br>
... It's you?
