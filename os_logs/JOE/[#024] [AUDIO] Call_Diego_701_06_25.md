**JOE**<br>
Hello, brother Fang? Gimme a sec, I'm cleaning a glass...

**Diego**<br>
Hi, JOE.

**JOE**<br>
... Diego!? Why did you call me yourself?

**Diego**<br>
The next job is very crucial. So I decided to inform you directly.

**Zark**<br>
Arf... Arf!

**JOE**<br>
Woah! Zark...

**Diego**<br>
Playing with the dog?

**JOE**<br>
One moment please... get down you dumb dog... can't you see that I'm working?

**Diego**<br>
......

**JOE**<br>
Apologies, I'm back. So what's this crucial job?

**Diego**<br>
Three days later, secret code: "Devil's puppet". Hunter will be on\-site to supervise everything. You get it, right?

**JOE**<br>
Puppet?

**Diego**<br>
Yes.

**JOE**<br>
... A human, isn't it? Another kidnapping?

**Diego**<br>
F\*\*\*! Wise up! Now I have to spend money to erase this phone call from the records.

**JOE**<br>
......

**Diego**<br>
Hunter told me that you helped out a few years ago. You know what to do then.<br>
These types of buyers are very rare, but the payment is usually significant. Both you and I can make a fortune out of this deal.

**JOE**<br>
Hmm...

**Diego**<br>
What's wrong?

**JOE**<br>
Nothing.

**Diego**<br>
... JOE, do you know what I see when I look at you?

**JOE**<br>
... Huh?

**Diego**<br>
The answer is myself. Your eyes show my reflection. Maybe you think you've kept it well\-hidden, but I'm always there. You and I are the same. What you see, what you hear, what you think, I know it like the back of my hand.

**JOE**<br>
......

**Diego**<br>
So, you just need to do one thing... tell me, whatever is on your mind. Tell me clearly, word by word.

**JOE**<br>
I...

**Diego**<br>
I'm listening.

**JOE**<br>
Recently... I've been thinking about this a lot. I still feel like this is not good. Pops' ideals exist for their reasons. I don't understand them back then, still don't really understand them now, but...

**Diego**<br>
Your conclusion?

**JOE**<br>
I don't want to break the law anymore! In the future, JOEZ Cafe will return to what it used to be. I will only offer services to legal transactions and maintain the current balance... even though you guys are already by far the largest gang now.

**Diego**<br>
......

**JOE**<br>
Hello?

**Diego**<br>
... I've been expecting you to say that, JOE.<br>
We've been partners for a long time now. To be honest, I already noticed that your mind was struggling.

**JOE**<br>
Is that so...?

**Diego**<br>
However, I've already accepted this deal. Canceling it now will do great harm to my credibility. Take this as a final request. Help me out on this case, and we'll talk about the details after its done. Deal?

**JOE**<br>
... Alright.

**Diego**<br>
Boy, I've been in the gang business since I was 15. It's been decades. Yet you're the only person in my career so far that feels "alive" to me. I won't let you suffer.

**JOE**<br>
... Thank you!

**Diego**<br>
No need for that. Go play with your dog.
