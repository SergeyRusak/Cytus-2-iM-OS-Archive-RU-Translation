## Log Content
**Xenon**<br>
King of Germs.

**JOE**<br>
JASUS! That freaked me out... Why are you here?

**Xenon**<br>
I'm here to visit my father's grave... Hey, are you crying?

**JOE**<br>
Me? The manly JOE? What nonsense are you spewing! Hahaha!<br>
I'm also here to visit pops. What a coincidence!

**Xenon**<br>
Uncle Saxon... When we visited your house back then, he was always so welcoming to us.<br>
I'm sorry; I wasn't able to make it to his funeral... Let me light a cigarette for him.

**JOE**<br>
Haha, sure, go ahead! He's gonna love it!

**JOE**<br>
But seriously, when are you going to quit smoking? You're already 26.

**Xenon**<br>
Advising me to start drinking while also advising me to quit smoking, isn't that a bit contradictory...?

**JOE**<br>
Back then, during band practice, you and big sis were constantly going outside to "breath air". It was a waste of everyone's time.

**Xenon**<br>
Shut up.

**JOE**<br>
... How's everything going these days, between you and her? 'Bout time you guys get back together, isn't it?

**Xenon**<br>
... In your dreams. We haven't contacted each other since we were done with the Æsir case.

**JOE**<br>
Yikes... That's a bit heartless, don't you think?

**Xenon**<br>
She's kind of a celebrity now. On top of it, some paparazzi people have been harassing me lately. I don't want to have too much connection with her now.

**JOE**<br>
Jasus, you got paparazzi on you a\*\* now? Why don't I have the luxury to worry about these things...

**Xenon**<br>
Besides...

**JOE**<br>
Besides what?

**Xenon**<br>
Nothing. Forget about it.

**JOE**<br>
Aww\~ come on, why the hesitation?

**Xenon**<br>
I told you, it's nothing.

**JOE**<br>
Ehh\~\~? Muuu\~\~ Come on, tell me\~\~

**Xenon**<br>
... That's gross. Stop trying to imitate NEKO. You sound nothing like her and it's rather creepy...

**JOE**<br>
Teehee\~

**Xenon**<br>
......<br>
...... All in all, I feel like the fact she approached me all of sudden... it feels very... odd.

**JOE**<br>
Eh? How so?

**Xenon**<br>
... Our conversation that night, the one where you got really drunk, you actually didn't forget any of it, did you?

**JOE**<br>
......

**Xenon**<br>
What I'm about to tell you next has something to do with that conversation.

**JOE**<br>
......<br>
...... Haha, bro, that's cheating... You know very well that I don't want to lie in front of pops. That's why you decided to bring it up here, isn't it?

**Xenon**<br>
JOE, I said before, that no matter what happens, I will still be on your side.<br>
This time, I will no longer be hesitant.

*\[Puts down metal can\]*

**Xenon**<br>
... What is that?

**JOE**<br>
When I was still a kid, I had no idea what to give to pops for one of his birthdays. So, I found this metal can from a random trash heap, rubbed it until it shines, then gave it to him as a present.

**JOE**<br>
He gave that can back to me and told me to save my remaining allowance inside it. Once I have the whole can filled, donate it to the admins' Foundation for the Homeless. He said that the action itself can be my birthday gift to him.

**JOE**<br>
For the next year or so, I made multiple donations. Sometimes, in order to meet the donation deadline, I even asked for extra allowances from pops. Every time I did that, pops would be so happy.

**Xenon**<br>
... Let me make a guess. What actually happened was that you never even donated once. Instead, you spent all that money on video games.

**JOE**<br>
Haha! Bingo! You sure do know me well. There was this really popular handheld console at the time, the "SENA GAMEBAI III", right? One time, I got greedy and bought it with the money in the can. Pops later discovered the console and asked me where did I get the money to buy it. I had no choice but to tell him the truth. <br>
That old man was FURIOUS, let me tell you. I still flinch a bit when I recall the pummeling he served up that day. Haha...

**Xenon**<br>
You had it coming...

**JOE**<br>
I've received so many things from pops in my life, too many for me to count... yet I squandered them all.<br>
My grades at the Academy, Bass...... even now.

**Xenon**<br>
......

**JOE**<br>
Pops, I filled the metal can once again. This time, I will not disappoint you...

**Xenon**<br>
JOE……

**JOE**<br>
Simon, come to the Cafe tonight. Whatever you want to know, I will tell you.

**Xenon**<br>
......

**JOE**<br>
However, you must promise me one thing: make the right decision, one that you truly believe in.

**Xenon**<br>
Yes, I will. I promise you.
