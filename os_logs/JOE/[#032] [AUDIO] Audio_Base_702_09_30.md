*\[Door Opens\]*

**Xenon**<br>
What is this place?

**JOE**<br>
The basement of the Cafe... More commonly known as "The Exchange".

**Xenon**<br>
......

**JOE**<br>
Simon, what I'm about to tell you is everything that I have done here, in this very location, all of it.

**Xenon**<br>
... Got it. Go ahead.

**JOE**<br>
... This thing started all the way back with pops...

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

**JOE**<br>
... And just like that, all the transactions take place here. Even until now, this cafe is still offering the same services, operating among the gangs...

**Xenon**<br>
......

**JOE**<br>
I've never had a person to repent my crimes to. This business was passed down to me by pops. I acknowledged his ideals too... To be honest, I'm not even certain if this is something I need to repent... The only thing I know for sure is that I f\*\*\*ed up big time...

**Xenon**<br>
......

**JOE**<br>
After hearing all that... you find me despicable as well, don't you...?

**Xenon**<br>
... It is indeed despicable.

**JOE**<br>
Haha... As expected... I don't mind that either. I realized that a long time ago, and I've already prepared myself to live the rest of my life shouldering all the guilt...

*\[Punch\]*

**JOE**<br>
Ugh!

*\[Consecutive Punches\]*

**JOE**<br>
Arghhhh!!

**Xenon**<br>
I'm the sole person that you can repent to, right? Then the only person you need to feel guilty towards is me. I felt really p\*\*\*ed off after hearing you talk about those things, so I punched you. I feel much better now after giving you a smackdown.

**JOE**<br>
......

**Xenon**<br>
Now we're even.

**JOE**<br>
... Huh? Hey, you promised me that you'll make the right decision, one that you truly believe in...

**Xenon**<br>
Yes, and I just did. Afterward, if I ever remember these things and still feel p\*\*\*ed off, I'll come here and punch you again. I will punish you in place of those who suffered because of your actions. All you need to do is shut up and take my punches like a man.

**JOE**<br>
Ha... So is this the punishment I'm getting?

**Xenon**<br>
The underground punisher, didn't you ask if I was interested to make a comeback? Well, here I am.

**JOE**<br>
Haha... Okay, you win... By the way, what kind of puny punch was that? It barely tickled me.

**Xenon**<br>
Then how about I treat you to a few more of them?

**JOE**<br>
...... N, no thanks......

**Xenon**<br>
... JOE, about the human trafficking you just mentioned, there's a little girl with the name "Ringo", right? That just so happens to be related with the case I'm investigating.

**JOE**<br>
For real!?

**Xenon**<br>
Yes. I gave it some thought... About the situation between you and the Baro gang, I can't really do much from my current position. They are way too big of an organization for me to take on...<br>
However, at the very least, I can help solve the case of this little girl first.

**JOE**<br>
How are you going to do that? Diego and Co. cover their tracks very well. If any information leaks, they'll immediately suspect that I was involved...

**Xenon**<br>
Rest assured. The legendary "X" has returned. Let me handle this. I will not let the lines be traced back to you.

**JOE**<br>
... Simon, thank you.

**Xenon**<br>
The heck? This is so unlike you. Besides, I now have free punches to throw at your face whenever I feel like it. Don't thank me so soon.

**JOE**<br>
No, I am truly grateful to you... I've been under this immense pressure for such a long time, to the point where I can barely breathe. It's like the devil is clamping my heart in its claws... It's making me hysterical... Even my mom is really worried about me. I feel so much better after pouring my heart out to you...

**Xenon**<br>
......

*\[Punch\]*

**JOE**<br>
Oof!

**Xenon**<br>
This punch is "You're welcome".

**JOE**<br>
...... You really should work out more.

**Xenon**<br>
Shut up.

**JOE**<br>
... Oh, right. You said... that the incident with big sis may have something to do with the things I just said. What's all that about?

**Xenon**<br>
Yeah...... Sherry, Luis, Shannon... as well as my father's death; they may all be related to this human trafficking group.

**JOE**<br>
Eh!?

**Xenon**<br>
I was able to track this group down afterward. This is an organization whose roots were from Node 03 and have existed for multiple decades already. I think "Mogura" is the name. It's highly possible that 03's Administration Bureau has been infiltrated by them as well... Human trafficking is one of their largest businesses.

**JOE**<br>
Are you saying that big sis is...?

**Xenon**<br>
... Here's my personal view on all this...
