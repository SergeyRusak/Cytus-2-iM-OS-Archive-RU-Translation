**JOE**<br>
... Hello.

**Fang**<br>
It's me.

**JOE**<br>
Brother Fang? Business?

**Fang**<br>
Yes.

**JOE**<br>
A bit too much recently, don't you think? I'm almost sleep deprived these days.

**Fang**<br>
Who gives a f\*\*\*? I'm gonna speak, listen carefully.

**JOE**<br>
Gimme a sec, I'll grab the Pad... OK, go ahead.

**Fang**<br>
Capo Hunter wants me to inform you, transaction date is three nights later. Secret code: "Devil's Candy". Pretty big package, be prepared.

**JOE**<br>
Candy... so, the cargo this time is...

**Fang**<br>
Even if you guessed it, don't say it. It's gonna leave a record.

**JOE**<br>
... Just a heads up, I don't have much experience dealing with this stuff. When pops is still alive, we would absolutely not touch this stuff. When did Baro start selling "Candy"?

**Fang**<br>
A few dozen years already. Boss wants to expand the business, which is why you are involved this time. If things go along smoothly, will become one of the major products in the future.

**JOE**<br>
......

**Fang**<br>
What's wrong?

**JOE**<br>
... Nothing, it just hit me, that Diego is really now your Boss.

**Fang**<br>
The Ando gang is nothing more than a name at this point. Only a small bunch is still holding on. Joining Diego's ranks is the way to go. I still want my career to last longer.

**JOE**<br>
Brother Wang is now one of Ando's top members. He's gonna explode if he hears this from you.

**Fang**<br>
That guy's too stubborn. I don't expect him to understand my choices either. Sorry, no more gunslinger showdowns for you to charge commission anymore.

**JOE**<br>
Haha...

**Fang**<br>
......

**JOE**<br>
... Feels like you have changed, brother Fang.

**Fang**<br>
People change. Nothing special.

**JOE**<br>
Really? Cause I feel like I didn't change much, haha.

**Fang**<br>
It's been more than half a year since you started working with Boss. Are you sure about that?

**JOE**<br>
......

**Fang**<br>
That's all there is. See you in three days.

**JOE**<br>
... Bye.
