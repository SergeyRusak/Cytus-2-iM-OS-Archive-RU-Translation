**JOE**<br>
Hello, sit anywhere you like.

**Hayato**<br>
Do you have saké?

**JOE**<br>
Yep, wait one sec.<br>
Do you want it heated?

**Hayato**<br>
No.

**JOE**<br>
Never seen you before. Are you from the east? Node 03?

**Hayato**<br>
Yes. Is it rare to see one around these places?

**JOE**<br>
Nah, where do you think this is? It's 08, any type of people can be found here.<br>
But cold saké... indeed not an order you see every day.

**Hayato**<br>
Back home we call this "Yukihie", refreshes the brain quite well... *\*Gulp!\**

**JOE**<br>
Yukihie, I see...

**Hayato**<br>
*\*Gulp!\**

**JOE**<br>
Jasus, slow down. If you get drunk so fast, I'm gonna be the one carrying your limp body outside.<br>
I've always had a fond interest in chatting with customers from other Nodes.

**Hayato**<br>
I'm... not exactly the type who's good at chatting.

**JOE**<br>
Haha, it's fine. I'm JOE, and you are?

**Hayato**<br>
Hayato... *\*Gulp!\**

**JOE**<br>
Did you get dumped?

**Hayato**<br>
... Why did you ask?

**JOE**<br>
Well, a young fella with a depressed look visiting an unfamiliar bar with the sole purpose of getting trashed. Pretty sure that means it has something to do with relationship issues... I think?

**Hayato**<br>
I'm... looking for a female.

**JOE**<br>
Girlfriend?

**Hayato**<br>
More or less my childhood friend, been missing for years already... *\*Gulp!\**

**JOE**<br>
For years... could it be that she already... ah, I'm sorry.

**Hayato**<br>
No need to be...I gave up a long time ago too. In Node 03, missing people usually stay missing forever. It's practically a part of everyday life.<br>
However, for some unknown reason, I just always have this feeling that she is right here in Node 08. A very powerful feeling too...*\*Gulp!\**

**JOE**<br>
... If you're looking for someone, maybe you've come to the right location.<br>
Not to brag about it, but this little shop really has all kinds of people visiting every day. Give me some hints, maybe I can help. If you have a photo, even better.

**Hayato**<br>
A photo... I always have it with me. Here.

**JOE**<br>
Hoho, lemme take a look. Heard from folks that Node 03 is where all the cute gals are at...

**JOE**<br>
......!

**JOE**<br>
...... This person......

**Hayato**<br>
...... zzZ......

**JOE**<br>
... He's drunk.

**Hayato**<br>
...... Kaori......
