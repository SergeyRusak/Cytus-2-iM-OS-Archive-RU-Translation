*\[Crowd screams and applauds\]*

**Cherry**<br>
That was《CREDENCE》! Thank you, everybody!

**Cherry**<br>
Didn't expect so many people to show up today... Everyone's so passionate! Give yourselves a large round of applause!

**Cherry**<br>
Good... For our next song, it is written by the bassist of Crystal PuNK, JOE... hey JOE, you introduce it yourself.

**JOE**<br>
You serious? Can I hold the mic?

**Cherry**<br>
Hurry up.

**JOE**<br>
Ehe, hehehe, um, hello everyone. I'm JOE... Oh god, I'm so nervous. Umm, the, um, next song is...

**Cherry**<br>
Why are you stammering! Stopping faking it! Your acting sucks!

**JOE**<br>
OWWW!

*\[Crowd laughs\]*

**JOE**<br>
We agreed on not to hit the hair! Alright, hello guys! I'm Crystal PuNK's bassist JOE!

*\[Crowd screams\]*

**JOE**<br>
Those who have followed us must know this. WHO AM I??

**Audience**<br>
THE BASS GOD OF QUADRANT III!

**JOE**<br>
Good, very good! Everyone's being nice today! To be fair, my BASS was taught by my uncle. I call him pops. Pops loves Jazz music, so much so that he opened a Jazz bar. The shop's name is SAXO Café. If you happen to pass by, we welcome you to come in and have a drink...

**Xenon**<br>
Hey, time is running out.

*\[Crowd screams\]*

**JOE**<br>
Wait, what are you guys screaming for? Damn you Xenon, you and your good looks...

**Xenon**<br>
Another word and you get drumsticks to the face.

**JOE**<br>
You're not even the drummer... ok, ok. All in all, I wrote a song with a bit of Jazz flavor in it. It's slightly different from our previous style. I hope...

**JOE**<br>
……！！

**JOE**<br>
……Pops?

**Xenon**<br>
What's the matter?

**JOE**<br>
Umm, nothing... I hope everyone likes it!
