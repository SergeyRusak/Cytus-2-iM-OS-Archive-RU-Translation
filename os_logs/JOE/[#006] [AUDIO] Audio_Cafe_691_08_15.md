**Zark**<br>
Arf!

**Luo**<br>
It's been quite a while, UNCLE. Been in your care for quite some time now.

**Saxon**<br>
Oh, it's you! Haven't seen you in a long time. Must be tough managing an entire gang, right? Martini?

**Luo**<br>
No, just here to open my wine collection and have a chat. How are you doing these days?

**Saxon**<br>
Business is booming. Thanks to "R", I recently got access to a brand\-new group of customers.

**Luo**<br>
R... the information broker you mentioned before?

**Saxon**<br>
Yes. His purchases mostly feature obscure documents, be it about history, ancient technology, information on other Nodes... all rare and exquisite stuff. Also, I've seen this guy do business myself; not your average joe.

**Luo**<br>
How so?

**Saxon**<br>
He is well educated and very intelligent. It's very obvious that he is vastly different than the other thugs who come here to trade for information. I often see him play his informant like a fiddle.

**Luo**<br>
Sounds like a dangerous folk... you should be careful yourself too.

**Saxon**<br>
Hmph, no need to worry\~ He is good enough to earn my praise, but not enough to truly impress me. He has a clear understanding of the rules here, and he never buys on credit too.

**Luo**<br>
So he has a good credit score just like me.

**Saxon**<br>
Indeed. Over here at my place, "Credit is everything". <br>
Cheers?

**Luo**<br>
Of course.

*\[Cheers\]*

**Luo**<br>
Ah, right. During the last trade, some crew members got into a fight and things nearly got out of hand. It was your boy who came in and calmed everyone down. I have to thank you for that.

**Saxon**<br>
You mean... JOE?

**Luo**<br>
You've never heard about it?

**Saxon**<br>
He didn't mention anything about this to me. What happened?

**Luo**<br>
Well, it's like this...

*[»»» Fast Forward »»»]*

**Luo**<br>
Those two love to compete with each other, too much actually. Sometimes the mood in the gang just gets really awkward when those two are at it. Even I was having a little trouble dealing with them...<br>
Since JOE introduced them to the game, now they handle most of their clashes through that game. Thanks to that, the other gang members can also treat their competition with a more relaxed manner.

**Saxon**<br>
Is that so...

**Luo**<br>
Pretty good job by that kid, don't you think? I expect no less from your protégé.

**Saxon**<br>
The only thing he cared about is the money. Don't you dare think about dragging him into your world.

**Luo**<br>
You're still as sharp as always. Don't worry, I won't.<br>
Even though it is a pity...

**Saxon**<br>
A pity... is it?

**Luo**<br>
Yeah. From what I see, he's a kid with quite the potential.

**Saxon**<br>
......

**Luo**<br>
Woah, so it's this time already. Thanks for the drink. I have to go.

**Saxon**<br>
Alright. See you next time.

*\[Doorbell\]*

**Saxon**<br>
... Potential, eh? Not that I could see any.

**Saxon**<br>
Ah! Ugh...

*\[Glass Shatters\]*

**Saxon**<br>
*\*Huff\**, *\*Puff\**... My chest...

**Saxon**<br>
*\*Huff\**...... *\*Puff\**...... Damnit, what's going on...

**Zark**<br>
Arf, arf!, ARF!

**Saxon**<br>
No need to worry, Zark... I'm ok.
