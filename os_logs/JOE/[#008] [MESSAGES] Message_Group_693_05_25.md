**JOE**<br>
OK, let's get back to the meeting XD<br>
*[Sent at PM 08:37]*

**KAI**<br>
First the band name, final decision is the one Big sis came up with, crystal punk, everyone ok with this?<br>
*[Sent at PM 08:38]*

**Cherry**<br>
Some of the letters are capitalized, it's Crystal PuNK<br>
*[Sent at PM 08:39]*

**KAI**<br>
Got it. I myself quite like this name. It has a nice ring to it<br>
*[Sent at PM 08:39]*

**JOE**<br>
How bout CRYSTAL PUNK? Looks more impactful<br>
*[Sent at PM 08:39]*

**Cherry**<br>
All Caps names are everywhere, doesn't stand out<br>
*[Sent at PM 08:40]*

**JOE**<br>
I know that XDDD I'm ok with the name\~
The most important thing is that it's a band with you guys!<br>
*[Sent at PM 08:40]*

**JOE**<br>
We are Crystal PuNK!! Our goal is the world stage!!<br>
*[Sent at PM 08:40]*

**Cherry**<br>
... If KAI's the one who said this, I would probably be really touched<br>
*[Sent at PM 08:41]*

**KAI**<br>
That's a bit much
Alright, one thing done, next thing. 
Regarding other members, any thoughts or possible candidates?<br>
*[Sent at PM 08:41]*

**KAI**<br>
I'll go first. Last time, I went on a LIVE and came across a pretty good bassist. He's pretty consistent; let's switch JOE out<br>
*[Sent at PM 08:42]*

**Cherry**<br>
Agreed<br>
*[Sent at PM 08:42]*

**JOE**<br>
Wait, WTF XDDD
What about our goal of the world stage!!!!!<br>
*[Sent at PM 08:42]*

**KAI**<br>
Who said it's going to be with you? That guy's slap is incredible<br>
*[Sent at PM 08:43]*

**Cherry**<br>
Looks like JOE you can leave in peace<br>
*[Sent at PM 08:43]*

**JOE**<br>
NOOOOOOO\~\~\~\~<br>
*[Sent at PM 08:43]*

**KAI**<br>
Nah, just kidding. JOE, you mentioned about a guitarist you knew. Is he any good?<br>
*[Sent at PM 08:44]*

**JOE**<br>
Ah, right! I'll show you guys his solo!!
He's totally gonna be the next big thing!<br>
*[Sent at PM 08:44]*

**JOE**<br>
[JOE has shared a link.]<br>
*[Sent at PM 08:45]*

**Cherry**<br>
Holy cow... he's amazing... that's professional level stuff right there<br>
*[Sent at PM 08:48]*

**KAI**<br>
Amazing indeed. The sound is stable. The tone is smooth and clear even during shredding. How did you get to know him?<br>
*[Sent at PM 08:48]*

**JOE**<br>
I actively harassed him ofc XD
We know each other pretty well now. Should I get him in this chat?<br>
*[Sent at PM 08:48]*

**Cherry**<br>
Sure, but I have things to deal with tonight. How about tomorrow?<br>
*[Sent at PM 08:49]*

**KAI**<br>
I think tomorrow's fine too. JOE, contact him. Invite him to this chat tomorrow night and we can continue the discussion then<br>
*[Sent at PM 08:49]*

**JOE**<br>
Understood! Yes Sir, leader!!!<br>
*[Sent at PM 08:50]*

**KAI**<br>
Can someone else be the leader instead... please...<br>
