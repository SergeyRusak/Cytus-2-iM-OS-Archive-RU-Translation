**JOE**<br>
Greetings, Mr. R. I found you a seller.

**[Rald]**<br>
*Hello, successor. It's not like this is the first time we exchanged information. Why do you have to be so formal?*

**JOE**<br>
You are my customer. This is a job... The seller wants information regarding the secret passageways in Node 08's outskirt areas. As long as you can provide it, this transaction will be a done deal.<br>
I would like you to include my handling fees as well.

**[Rald]**<br>
*The secret passageways in the outskirt areas... That is highly\-classified stuff that both the light and shadow sides of society are pursuing...  Bringing up such a request, and willing to provide me information... The seller is unquestionably related to the Administration Bureau. Young lad, I hope you realize that you're walking on extremely thin ice.*

**JOE**<br>
I have my connections... No need for you to be concerned.

**[Rald]**<br>
*Hoho... Quick reminder, successor. When Saxon was still around, this was not how you people do business.*

**JOE**<br>
I do things my way. You just haven't understood me well enough.

**[Rald]**<br>
*This is where you are wrong. About you, I definitely know plenty...<br>
Sparing other unrelated details, at the very least, I am very well aware of your relationship with Simon Jackson.*

**JOE**<br>
......!

**[Rald]**<br>
*No need to be shocked. On the day I requested the transaction, I mentioned his name. For an instant, you hesitated. That's why I decided to look into it...<br>
Band name's Crystal PuNK, right? Still too young, but the music is quite good. You can feel the power.*

**JOE**<br>
... So what? What is there to hide about this?

**[Rald]**<br>
*Then perhaps you should try to hide it. If someone wants to harm your friend, you are his biggest weakness.<br>
Oh, or are you the one who's most aware of this?*

**JOE**<br>
......

**[Rald]**<br>
*Whatever. I've already sent the information the seller requested to you. The handling fees are transferred to your account as well. You take a look. This dark web travels a long way to the server at Node 03. The signal is so pathetic that every time I use it, I'm worried about an error occurring.*

*\[File transfer\]*

**JOE**<br>
Everything is fine. I will now send you the info you requested.

*\[File transfer\]*

**[Rald]**<br>
*Got it. Let me take a look... perfect. Even has footage of that guy's arrest. <br>
It was certainly the right choice to approach you for this deal.*

**JOE**<br>
Arrest...

**[Rald]**<br>
*......*

**[Rald]**<br>
*One more question.<br>
Did you know that he is Æsir? Or, he kept you in the dark too and you didn't notice it at all throughout all these years?*

**JOE**<br>
... Simon is indeed a phenomenal hacker. However, he is definitely not that Æsir person. The admins got the wrong guy.

**[Rald]**<br>
*Ho?*

**JOE**<br>
You seem to be investigating the Æsir incident as well, right? No matter what you want to do, I for one is certain that Simon is innocent. He will be released by the admins in no time.

**[Rald]**<br>
*Then I have some bad news for you.<br>
From what I've heard, the Æsir incident has caused immense pressure to the admins. On top of that, the civilian riots a while ago have made them incredibly nervous. Therefore, they plan to make him plead guilty as soon as possible.*

**JOE**<br>
That's bulls\*\*\*. They can't...

**[Rald]**<br>
*Young lad, You should know very well about the methods they use to doom a person... Hide the truth, force a conviction, manipulate the public... In the end, the gates of hell will be opened to him.<br>
When it comes to these sort of things, the admins are even more brutal than the gangs. And that, is the end that awaits Simon Jackson.*

**JOE**<br>
......

**[Rald]**<br>
*... Despite that, you seem to firmly believe that "Simon Jackson = Æsir " is a lie.<br>
If so, accept this! You will have a use for it.*

*\[File transfer\]*

**JOE**<br>
What the hell... An encrypted file...

**JOE**<br>
...... Information about the Æsir incident!?<br>
Why are you giving me this stuff?

**[Rald]**<br>
*In order to break the power of lies, one must only rely on the truth.<br>
Keep it somewhere safe! It's a free gift from me. Whatever you want to do with it, I will not interfere, successor...*
