**Wang**<br>
JOE!

**JOE**<br>
Capo Wang, what's up?

**Wang**<br>
Watch the news!

**JOE**<br>
Huh? Calm down will ya, how about a drink first...

**Wang**<br>
STOP MESSING AROUND! QUICK!

*[»»» Fast Forward »»»]*

**News**<br>
... Law enforcement agents ambushed several criminal organization strongholds late last night, uncovering dozens of firearms and criminal evidence. Dozens were arrested. According to the info, included in the arrested criminals are several key figures of Node 08's notorious Ando gang...

**JOE**<br>
Holy f\*\*\*! Is Boss Luo alright?

**Wang**<br>
Got busted! Several top members in the gang didn't make it too. Everyone's saying that those damn admins definitely got their hands on the roster list available only to the top members!

**JOE**<br>
Roster list... ah!

**Wang**<br>
What?

**JOE**<br>
No, it can't be... oh god, oh god...

**Wang**<br>
Did you think of something?

**JOE**<br>
No... there are still other customers.

**Hunter**<br>
I don't mind. Tell us.

**JOE**<br>
!! You're...

**Hunter**<br>
Long time no see, s\*\*\*head. Finally recognizing me now?

**Wang**<br>
Mad Dog of Baro...

**Hunter**<br>
Who the f\*\*\* are you? The grown\-ups are talking business, you kids can go play with your toys.

**Wang**<br>
So you can't even recognize a senior. Is it a death sentence you're looking for?

**Hunter**<br>
S\*\*\*head, Martini, three olives.

**JOE**<br>
......

*\[Doorbell\]*

**Diego**<br>
... The Martini is my order. <br>
Gentlemen, please; let me talk with this boy here alone.

**Hunter**<br>
You guys heard it. The "grown\-ups" are going to talk business. We "kids" better not interrupt them. Shoo, shoo. Get out.

**Wang**<br>
... JOE, you bastard...

**JOE**<br>
I don't know anything!

*\[Doorbell\]*

**JOE**<br>
You know about the Martini rule. You're...

**Diego**<br>
My name is Diego.

**JOE**<br>
Baro's Consigliere...

**Diego**<br>
Wrong, the Boss now. Since you know me, then things should be simple.<br>
I also happen to know that you're the owner of the Cafe, JOE... and that you're also the one who took the admins' cheap bait and accidentally leaked the roster list.

**JOE**<br>
......

**Diego**<br>
No need to be nervous. I can turn that info into an eternal secret. Today, I'm only here to have a little chat with the successor of the great UNCLE \- Saxon.

**JOE**<br>
... A chat about what?

**Diego**<br>
A brand\-new order... or something like that.
