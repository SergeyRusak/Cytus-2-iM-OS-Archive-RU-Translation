**JOE**<br>
What the hell? Who would call at this time...<br>
Hello!?

**[???]**<br>
*JOE, it's me.*

**JOE**<br>
Simon!?

**[Xenon]**<br>
*Is everything fine on your side?*

**JOE**<br>
NOPE! Nothing is fine here! So many things have happened! My brain is having trouble comprehending everything!<br>
Besides, shouldn't I be the one asking you? Where are you now? Is this call secure?

**[Xenon]**<br>
*Yes. I'm calling from Sherry's communication device with encryption. Have you seen the news?*

**JOE**<br>
......?<br>
No... I'll watch it now.

**[TV]**<br>
*... Just now, we've also been gradually receiving news regarding the drones' attacks on the cities. Due to the extreme chaos at the site, the number of casualties and other details are still unknown...*

**JOE**<br>
Yikes... That seems really bad. Rest assured though. The location in the news is quite a distance from here. From the looks of it, it shouldn't be anything serious.

**[Xenon]**<br>
*Good to hear.*

**JOE**<br>
Ah, now's not the time to talk about that!<br>
I just experienced something that's actually a big deal!

**[Xenon]**<br>
*... What is it?*

**JOE**<br>
PAFF and NEKO...

**[Xenon]**<br>
*PAFF and NEKO??*

**JOE**<br>
Ahh... my brain is still in complete chaos. All in all, you should calm down and listen to me!

**[Xenon]**<br>
*You're the one that should calm down. What happened exactly?*

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

**JOE**<br>
... That's pretty much it. Oh, and both of them rushed out of my shop just now.

**[Xenon]**<br>
*......<br>
Understood. However, this encrypted call won't last too long. Sherry and I are at a really bizarre underground facility right now. We're about to be on our way to Node 03. I'll contact you again once we arrived in Node 03. I'll contact NEKO too.*

**JOE**<br>
Gotcha! Ah, one more thing. Once you get there, go find KAI first. I told him about this. He'll probably figure out a way to get you guys a place to stay for a short while.

**[Xenon]**<br>
*... Don't get unrelated people involved in this stuff, will you...*

**JOE**<br>
What are you talking about? We're all related through "Crystal PuNK", right? If there's trouble, of course we'll help each other out!

**[Xenon]**<br>
*Okay, okay, you win... Alright, I get it. Then that's it for now. Also, thanks.*

*[Call Ends]*

**JOE**<br>
Sigh...... I need a drink...
