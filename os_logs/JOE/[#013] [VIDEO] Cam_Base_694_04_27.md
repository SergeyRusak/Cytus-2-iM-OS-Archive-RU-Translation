*\[Puts down crate\]*

**JOE**<br>
Dang, this crate is heavy as s\*\*\*... what the hell is in it?

**Hunter**<br>
......

**JOE**<br>
Um... are you ok? You spewed a crap ton of blood...

**Hunter**<br>
Shut up. I'll go clean up my wounds. You clean up the crate and the cargo inside.

*[»»» Fast Forward »»»]*

**JOE**<br>
Good, the outside is now squeaky clean. Next, the cargo inside...

*\[Unlocks crate\]*

**JOE**<br>
Jesus f\*\*\*\*\* Christ!!!

**Young Girl**<br>
...... Ugh......uhhh......

**JOE**<br>
A... a girl?

**Young Girl**<br>
...... Water......

**JOE**<br>
Water?

**Young Girl**<br>
Water...

**JOE**<br>
Oh! Gimme a sec.

*[»»» Fast Forward »»»]*

**JOE**<br>
Here, drink it.

**Young Girl**<br>
...... Gulp... *\*Cough! Cough cough!\**

**JOE**<br>
Slow down, slow down girl. Take it easy!

**Young Girl**<br>
... *\*Cough cough\**... tha...

**JOE**<br>
What did you say?

**Young Girl**<br>
......

**JOE**<br>
She fainted...

*\[Door opens\]*

**Hunter**<br>
You done? The buyer is almost here.

**JOE**<br>
Hey dude! What the f\*\*\* is this? There's a human inside!

**Hunter**<br>
S\*\*\*! Why did you move her out again!? Are you really trying to get me f\*\*\*\*\* killed?

**JOE**<br>
She said she wanted water...

**Hunter**<br>
I don't give a f\*\*\* if she wanted water or p\*\*\*, put her back in, now! Goddamnit... did I miscalculate the amount of narcotic to use? If the buyer finds out that she's awake, we're both dead meat! Move, I'll give her another shot.

**JOE**<br>
... Let her go.

**Hunter**<br>
... Huh??

**JOE**<br>
I said let her go. How could you take this? It's a living young girl!

**Hunter**<br>
Do you realize what you are talking about right now?

**JOE**<br>
Let her go. I'll take the responsibility.

*\[Punch\]*

**JOE**<br>
ARGH!

**Hunter**<br>
Responsibility? You can't even take one punch from me! Ptui!

**Hunter**<br>
Listen, s\*\*\*head, this is a very important transaction for us. Stop causing us trouble! When we first announced the reward, you were the first one to agree to help; and now you're trying to play hero?

**JOE**<br>
I had no idea that you guys are doing human trafficking! If pops knew about this kind of private business...

*\[Punch\]*

**JOE**<br>
UGHHH!

**Hunter**<br>
Pops this, pops that... shut it, you damn p\*\*\*\*! That stinkin old man, always spewing about that "balance" stuff. Do you have any idea how much crap we Baro crew members had to deal with these days because of that?

*\[Ringtone\]*

**Hunter**<br>
Hello? Yes, the cargo is cleaned, no problem at all... Yes, of course... understood!

**Hunter**<br>
They are arriving in ten minutes. I need to prep the cargo. You better lay there and don't interfere. Use your brain and think carefully before you take on a case, you f\*\*\*\*\* idiot.

**JOE**<br>
Ugh...

*[Signal Lost]*
