**Zheng**<br>
... JOE? Haven't seen you in years.

**JOE**<br>
Haha, Brother Zheng! You used to come to the shop to talk things out with Brother Luo. Pops would always treat you to an extra Godfather. You even said that it was the best booze you ever had in your life, am I right?

**Zheng**<br>
Oh... you still remember that?

**JOE**<br>
Of course. There's also that one time you guys held a bachelor party in the shop. Threw up all over the place. Pops had quite the long face that night. It was hilarious...

**Hunter**<br>
F\*\*\*. what are you blabbing 'bout!? Who the hell allowed you to come in here?

**JOE**<br>
Relax. I know you guys are talking about Diego... He was shot in one of the branches and no one knows who killed him, right?

**Hunter**<br>
!? How did you know…

**JOE**<br>
I deal in information. I have first\-hand intel on the situation in 03. Let's talk about the serious stuff. Brother Fang, you guys are in big trouble.

**Fang**<br>
... We'll figure something out.

**JOE**<br>
From what I've heard, you are in a total mess now. Baro's been abusing the power and reaping the rewards for a long time. With Diego now gone, many people are skipping out in fear of being avenged... the organization's collapsing, fast.

**Hunter**<br>
Shut your mouth! You wanna die!?

**Zheng**<br>
JOE, you came all the way here for a purpose, right? Why don't you just tell us what is it.

**JOE**<br>
... First, take a look at this.

*\[Projection\]*

**Fang**<br>
Bank account information... Hmm!? That much...?

**Zheng**<br>
... That's no small money. Is it yours?

**JOE**<br>
Heck no... I couldn’t make this much even if I sold all my organs.<br>
This is Pops' secret bank account.

**Fang**<br>
Mr. Saxon's...?

**JOE**<br>
Hehe, Pops kept his account info hidden in a small safe. When he reconstructed the Café for me, he buried it inside the concrete wall. I was only able to find it by accident when my shop got blown to pieces by the drones a few days ago.

**Zheng**<br>
This is astonishing. This money could easily support the entire gang... Why would Uncle do this?

**JOE**<br>
About that, Pops left me a note. It's embarrassing to say... but he knew me too well. He knew that I'd spend this money recklessly, so he hid it. He even went as far as to say that he hoped I'd never find it.

**JOE**<br>
He said that I could only use it if all else failed. On top of that, he wanted me to think carefully about who the right people are to spend this money on, this money that was earned by the boys in the gang, one penny at a time.

**JOE**<br>
I stressed all night. Even thought about escaping to Node 47 with this money and making it big there... but I can't do that. Pops would be very sad if I did that.

**Fang**<br>
……

**JOE**<br>
... Everyone knows in their hearts that Diego had been going overboard these last few years. The ordinary folk already treat the gangs as complete bad guys... This is not the kind of balance that Pops wanted.

**JOE**<br>
This money should not be used by me. It belongs to the gangs. I want to use it to unify everybody. Let us live with our chests out, chins raised high. Let's change people's opinions of us... Like what Pops would definitely say, "To not let gangs become something truly evil".

**Zheng**<br>
... You wanna return to Uncle's way of doing things? All by yourself?

**JOE**<br>
That's right. By myself, and every single brother in the gangs. Haha, I don't have the brightest mind, so that's all I could think of...

**Fang**<br>
You're too naïve, JOE. Those who live in the shadows will always be treated like trash by those who live under the sun. It was Diego who brought us above them. It was him who gave us our own power and territory...

**JOE**<br>
But his way of doing things caused way too much misfortune for way too many people. Remember Brother Wang? You and I... we both lost something we'll never get back.

**Fang**<br>
... Wang, he... was caught by the admins.

**JOE**<br>
Brother Fang, the admin operation that arrested the remaining Ando members really came out of nowhere; weren't you even a bit suspicious? The Ando gang at the time was already severely weakened; what was the point of arresting them? Who's the one that leaked the info to the admins? And who's the one to gain full control of 08's gangs through all of that?

**Fang**<br>
……

**JOE**<br>
Getting rid of all obstacles just for your ideals, not even caring if it's your own people... I don't want to see my friends living in a world like that.

**Zheng**<br>
*\*Chuckles\**, everyone can see it clearly. Eh…well then, whatta you wanna do? Successor of Café.

**JOE**<br>
Brother Zheng, Brother Feng, and all who are here. I, Joe Miller, swear upon Pops' name, that the Café will help everyone maintain order, and bring things back to the way Pops envisioned. However, I can't do it myself... please!

**Fang**<br>
… JOE…

**Hunter**<br>
F\*\*\* you!!!

*\[Fists Flying\]*

**Hunter**<br>
You half\-crocked piece of s\*\*\*! Sweet words, but you ain't doing s\*\*\*. You're just trying to use this chance to steal my business!

**JOE**<br>
This money was earned by everyone in the gang. It's not yours, Mad Dog! I'm absolutely not backing off this time!

**Hunter**<br>
Back off my a\*\*\*! Eat my fist!

*\[Blocks\]*

**JOE**<br>
……

**Hunter**<br>
!? You stinkin...

**JOE**<br>
HMPH!

*\[Punch\]*

**Hunter**<br>
GaPuh!!!!

*\[Objects Crashing\]*

**JOE**<br>
This punch is for Zark and that girl!

*\[Footsteps\]*

**Fang**<br>
... Nice.<br>
JOE... I'll believe you this time. The Baro Brotherhood will comply with your proposal. Go for it. 

**Zheng**<br>
Second.<br>
However, the purer the idea, the harder it is to implement. I hope you can walk the walk better than you talk the talk.

**JOE**<br>
Don't worry, I won't screw up this time...<br>
Let me handle it.
