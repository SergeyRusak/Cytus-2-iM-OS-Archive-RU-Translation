**JOE**<br>
Hi, pops!

**Saxon**<br>
Be quiet. Zark is sleeping.

**JOE**<br>
You still haven't dump him yet? He's a pretty terrible guard dog if you ask me...<br>
Maybe I should wake him up with the noise of my practice? Hey, I came up with this really awesome move yesterday!

**Saxon**<br>
Practice by your self first. I've got work coming in very soon. We'll discuss about it later today.

**JOE**<br>
That type of work again?

**Saxon**<br>
Urgent case. Customer here to collect the packages.

**JOE**<br>
Okay, okay. whatever. You're not going to tell me more details anyway, even if I asked you.

**Saxon**<br>
... Interested in my work?

**JOE**<br>
Uh\-huh, a little bit. These "mysterious underground dealings" stuff seems quite fun.

**Saxon**<br>
If you keep treating "fun" as your top priority, it will come back to bite you someday.

**Saxon**<br>
To be fair, the customer ordered quite a bit of stuff this time. It's going to be tough if I carry it all by myself. What do you think, you want to help me carry this stuff?

**JOE**<br>
Hoho? Did someone hit you in the head? You want me, of all people, to help out?

**Saxon**<br>
You're all brawn and no brains anyway. Physical work should be right up your ally.

**JOE**<br>
Stinkin old man...Then what do I gain from this?

**Saxon**<br>
What you gain is that I will not tell your mother about the trouble you caused at school.

**JOE**<br>
EHHH! That's not fair...

**Saxon**<br>
Come, I'll pay you accordingly. It's about time you learn a little bit about where money comes from anyway.

**JOE**<br>
Cargobob no.1, JOE! At your service!

**JOE**<br>
Since you're getting me to help out, can you now tell me who these customers are, and what they are buying?

**Saxon**<br>
You're not a grown\-up yet, no need to rush. Wait till the day I pour you your first glass of booze, then we can talk about it.

**JOE**<br>
Alright, alright, you stingy old man.

**Saxon**<br>
Finish your drink quickly. Once you're done washing the cup, come find me in the basement.
