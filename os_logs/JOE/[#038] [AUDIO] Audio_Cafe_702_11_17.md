*\[Door Opens\]*

**JOE**<br>
......?

*\[Things crashing\]*

**JOE**<br>
Woah!? PAFF? Are you alright!? Why did you run upstairs?

**PAFF**<br>
Hah... hah...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Aroma\-chan! Your nose is bleeding!

**PAFF**<br>
......

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Ah! It's the same as last time. Could it be that you remembered something again?

*\[Things crashing\]*

**JOE**<br>
Hey! Where are you going? You can barely stand. Take a seat and catch your breath first, okay?

**PAFF**<br>
... Kaori...

**JOE**<br>
......!?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
... Who?

**PAFF**<br>
I don't know...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
......?

**JOE**<br>
... Kaori...?

*\[Things crashing\]*

**JOE**<br>
Hey!? You shouldn't be moving around...

**PAFF**<br>
I remember now! I have to go find him!

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Find him? Find who!?

**PAFF**<br>
Hayato!

**JOE**<br>
......!!

*\[Runs\]*

*\[Doorbell\]*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Aroma\-chan! Where are you going!? Wait for me!

*\[Runs\]*

*\[Doorbell\]*

**JOE**<br>
Hey! NEKO!

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

**JOE**<br>
That's... how is that... that can't be right...

*\[Doorbell\]*

**JOE**<br>
NEKO!? How did it go? Where's PAFF?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
She was so fast. NEKO couldn't catch up to her... *\*Huff\*... \*Puff\**

**JOE**<br>
Those names she just mentioned, I think I know who they are.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Eh!? For real?

**JOE**<br>
Yeah. They clearly don't sound like Node 08 names, which makes it easier for me to remember. Take a look at this business card.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
... Hayato! Who is this exactly?<br>
Ah! Isn't this the reporter who was chasing after us yesterday!?

**JOE**<br>
Looks like he's the one... This guy came to my shop once and mentioned that he was looking for a girl. I think Kaori was the exact name of the girl he was looking for.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Then why did Aroma\-chan...

**JOE**<br>
No idea. However, she said just now that she's going to go find him. My guess is that she definitely remembered something.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Is there an address on the business card?

**JOE**<br>
Only the address of the company...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
NEKO's gonna go there right now!

*\[Doorbell\]*

**JOE**<br>
Hey!

*\[Phone Rings\]*

**JOE**<br>
What the hell? Who would call at this time...<br>
Hello!?

**[???]**<br>
*JOE, it's me.*

**JOE**<br>
Simon!?
