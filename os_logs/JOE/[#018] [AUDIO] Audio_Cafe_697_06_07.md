**Wang**<br>
JOE, why does this Sea Breeze tastes so... light?

**JOE**<br>
You don't understand. That's how Sea Breezes should taste.

**Wang**<br>
Bull f\*\*\*\*\* s\*\*\*! You forgot to add Vodka, you dumba\*\*!

**JOE**<br>
Ah f\*\*\*! You're right. Got too caught up with squeezing the juices...

**Wang**<br>
I miss UNCLE... at least back then we can get actual good cocktails.

**JOE**<br>
Too much "work" lately, didn't have time to practice.

**Wang**<br>
... So you're now blaming us?

**JOE**<br>
Hold it right there! Capo Wang, you know me. No matter what happens, I will never blame the bros...

**Wang**<br>
Only thing I know about you is your lip service. On a side note, there was an increase in "work" since you took over this shop, right?

**JOE**<br>
Just this week so far. I won't complain though, made some pretty decent dough out of them.

**Wang**<br>
As far as we go, we didn't have any transaction recently that used the Cafe. Who and what were they buying?

**JOE**<br>
Capo Wang, you know the rules. The answer to this question is already "Martini" stuff.

**Wang**<br>
......

**Wang**<br>
JOE, you better be careful.

**JOE**<br>
Why?

**Wang**<br>
Those Baro guys, they've been very ambitious since a long time ago. Since you took over Cafe, they've been acting restless. Don't think it's a coincidence; I think you should pay a little attention to them.

**JOE**<br>
OK. I know, I know.

**Wang**<br>
In fact, I've been hearing some pretty bad rumors. Do you know the name Diego?

**JOE**<br>
Who?

**Wang**<br>
Baro Brotherhood's Consigliere, a callous and deceitful man. He has been amassing power for a long time. He also has some dangerous goons under his command. Everytime we face him, even Boss Luo gets nervous.

**JOE**<br>
Never heard of this guy.

**Wang**<br>
He very rarely shows himself in public. However, rumor has it that once he shows up in person, things will definitely go according to his plans... "No matter what happens, everything will work out."

**JOE**<br>
This type of BullS\*\*\* again... if he's really that brilliant, how come Baro has been stuck in second place forever?

**Wang**<br>
... Anyway, I gave you my warning.

**JOE**<br>
I know. I'm saving a file in my brain. Beep, beep, beep...

**Wang**<br>
Idiot.

**JOE**<br>
Hahaha. Another drink?

**Wang**<br>
You mean your mixed juices? No thanks. JOE, stay alert. Don't let UNCLE down.

**JOE**<br>
Yawn... Got it. Stop worrying about me.
