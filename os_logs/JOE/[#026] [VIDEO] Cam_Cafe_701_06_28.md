*Engines turned off*

**Hunter**<br>
The cargo is here. Come help.

**JOE**<br>
... Ok.

*\[Truck backdoor opens\]*

**Little Girl**<br>
Hmmmm! Mmm!

**JOE**<br>
!?<br>
Hey! How come it's a little girl!?

**Hunter**<br>
Ha! Isn't the purpose loud and clear?

**JOE**<br>
Didn't even use any narcotics, and what's with the nasty rope\-tying...

**Hunter**<br>
A request from the buyer. Looks like we have ourselves a serious sicko. Stop yapping, lock her in the basement.

**JOE**<br>
......

*[→Signal switch to Cam\_B1\_01]]*

**Hunter**<br>
We should wait a moment. The buyer should be coming anytime... ARGH!

**JOE**<br>
I CAN'T ACCEPT THINGS LIKE THIS AFTER ALL!!!!

**JOE**<br>
Are you ok? I'll untie the ropes now!

**Little Girl**<br>
HmmmMNN!!

*\[Gunshot\]*

**JOE**<br>
ARGH!

**Hunter**<br>
Don't move... next shot... won't be on the legs...

**JOE**<br>
... Ugh...

**Hunter**<br>
I've heard from the boss... so you want out? You really think you can leave whenever you want and keep yourself squeaky clean? What do you think we are, a f\*\*\*\*\* summer camp!?

**JOE**<br>
Please, I really... don't want to do things like this anymore.

**Hunter**<br>
Do you realize how much the organization has grown in the past few years? Stop acting that you didn't benefit from that! You made a s\*\*\* ton of money, didn't you? You think you can get off scot\-free with all that money? Who do you think you are!? HUH!?

**JOE**<br>
... If you kill me, the Boss won't let you off the hook.

**Hunter**<br>
Ha! Idiot! You really think the Boss cares about you? Anyone can run this shop. Stop flattering yourself, you narcissistic a\*\*hole!

**JOE**<br>
... Then that's even better. I'm going to take this girl and run away right now.

**Hunter**<br>
If you dare take another step... I'll shoot.

**Zark**<br>
GRRR! ARF! ARF ARF!

**Hunter**<br>
Yikes! You stupid dog! F\*\*\* off!

**JOE**<br>
Zark!! No...

*\[Gunshot\]*

**Zark**<br>
Arooo\~...

**JOE**<br>
Zark！！！！！！

**JOE**<br>
YOU BASTARD!! I'M GONNA F\*\*\*\*\* KILL YOU!!!!!!

**Diego**<br>
Stop!

**JOE**<br>
！！<br>
Uh... zzZ

**Diego**<br>
Good job. Let him sleep for a while.

**Angus**<br>
Yes, Boss.

**Diego**<br>
I knew things are going to go wrong with only you in charge. Thank god the meeting ended early.

**Angus**<br>
Hey, why did you killed the dog?

**Hunter**<br>
This son of a b\*\*\*\* bit me!

**Angus**<br>
So the Mad Dog is scared of dog bites? How amusing...

**Diego**<br>
You fool! I told you to talk with him and persuade him, and your idea of a "talk" is to kill his dog? Damn, now things are going to get complicated...

**Hunter**<br>
Boss, I'm sorry... I... this bastard wanted to escape with the cargo!

**Angus**<br>
Is that so? Then I guess this is a type of "persuasion", right? Send him a message that this time it's the dog. Next time, it's gonna be his mom or friends... even though this is a very vulgar method.

**Diego**<br>
Hmph... this is just temporary. Interpersonal relationships are not as easy as you think. This is the reason why you guys are stuck at your position. Mad Dog, clean up this mess. I don't want the buyer to see this wreck.

**Hunter**<br>
Yes, Boss... Umm... what should we do with the dog?

**Diego**<br>
It's s\*\*\* you made; deal with it yourself.

**Angus**<br>
Just find a random place and bury it. Hurry up.
