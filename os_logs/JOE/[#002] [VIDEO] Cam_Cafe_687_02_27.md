Look over there. It's that dog.

Still very much a puppy though, probably no more than a few months old.

**JOE**<br>
It's been around here a lot lately. It keeps digging around in the trash cans and making a huge mess, super annoying. Chase it away!

**Saxon**<br>
... It's only looking for food, no need to go that far. When you were digging around in the shop's fridge, I didn't say anything too.

**JOE**<br>
Hey! Why are you comparing me to a dog!

**Saxon**<br>
Give me the bone in the bag.

**JOE**<br>
You even prepared such a thing? Here, take it.

**Puppy**<br>
Arf! Arf!

**Saxon**<br>
No need to be scared... This is all yours, dig in.

**Puppy**<br>
Arf... arf.

**JOE**<br>
It's enjoying that bone way too much... ok, it doesn't look THAT annoying right now.

**Puppy**<br>
Arooo\~ ARF!

**JOE**<br>
Yikes! This stupid dog bit me! Forget it; we should chase it away!

**Saxon**<br>
The way you touched it was wrong.

**JOE**<br>
BullS\*\*\*!

**Saxon**<br>
... Give it a name.

**JOE**<br>
Name? For what?

**Saxon**<br>
I'm going to raise him as a guard dog.

**JOE**<br>
Huh? You serious?

**Saxon**<br>
Yes.

**JOE**<br>
Okay, okay... lemme think... how about Cerberus?

**Saxon**<br>
Cer... what is that?

**JOE**<br>
Cerberus, something I learned in school. Have you not heard about it? It's a creature from Old Age myths. Apparently, it's a giant dog with three heads. Sounds really cool.

**Saxon**<br>
I've never even finished school. No good, too hard to remember, not to mention that it doesn't have three heads.

**JOE**<br>
... Yeah, you have a point.

**Saxon**<br>
Let's call him Zark. It's the name of an old friend. Ah... it is male, right?

**JOE**<br>
Look at that "thing", you see that? Definitely male.

**Saxon**<br>
Good. Remember to come and take care of him from now on.

**JOE**<br>
Me? No freakin way! That sounds like a terrible chore!

**Saxon**<br>
The decision is already made. Zark, let's go back.

**Zark**<br>
Arf! Arf!

**JOE**<br>
Stupid dog...
