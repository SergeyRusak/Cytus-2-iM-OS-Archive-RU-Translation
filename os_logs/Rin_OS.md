**Yasushi**  
Rin, wake up!

**Rin**  
..._\*yawn\*_... \~ ahhh, Dad?

**Yasushi**  
What are you doing sleeping at the research institute? Don't you have class in the afternoon?

**Rin**  
Dad, did you forget? It's an exam day, we got off at noon.

**Yasushi**  
... Oh, yea? I forgot.

**Rin**  
I mentioned it at the table...

**Yasushi**  
Yeah? What's the matter?

**Rin**  
Nuh\-Nothing.  
What about Mom?

**Yasushi**  
Asa's in the lab, I'm about to head there as well.

**Rin**  
Oh... Can I go watch?

**Yasushi**  
No. The research into the florigen of Arabidopsis is entering its final stage. If the simulation of today's atomic structure is successful, it'll be a big step forward for us. Rin, just think about it. If humans could control the time that any flower blossomed...

**Rin**  
... Yeah, yeah, yeah, cut it out already! Dad, did you forget that your daughter's not a botanist!

**Yasushi**  
Oh, okay... Anyway, we're gonna leave around 7 today. You wanna head home first?

**Rin**  
But... nobody else is at home.

**Yasushi**  
Rin?

**Rin**  
... Whatever, I'll just wait until you're off. Can I do my homework in the lounge? Just like I used to.

**Yasushi**  
Alright, I'll have an Architect take you there.

_\[Call Starts\]_

**Yasushi**  
Administration, this is researcher H7301 Yazawa Yasushi, please send an Architect over to escort a guest.

**[Administrator]**  
_This is Nakamura. Received. Dr. Yazawa, I'll arrange it immediately... Did Rin come for a visit?_

**Rin**  
Hehe, Mr. Nakamura, good afternoon.

**Yasushi**  
Apologies, sorry to bother you...

**[Administrator]**  
_Not at all, she's always been a good girl. She never bothers anyone. She even helps out occasionally. Oh, yea, Rin, did you get that album I asked you to pick up for me?_

**Yasushi**  
... Nakamura, this is a public line, you know.

**[Administrator]**  
_Ah, ahh hahaha... the Architect will be right there!_

_\[Call Ends\]_

**Yasushi**  
Aigh... Rin, what kind of album did he ask you to get? It's not contraband, is it?

**Rin**  
Relax, it's just a folk album. It's a new album by an artist Mr. Nakamura likes. It's got an ancient feel, really unique! I'll let you have a listen later tonight!

**Yasushi**  
Your mother and I spend every day interacting with plants, we don't know anything about music. Forget it.  
Ah, the Architect is here.

_\[Footsteps\]_

**OPCII_0584_X**  
Hello, Mr. Yazawa.  
I am Architect No. OPCII\_0584\_X, at your command.

**Yasushi**  
Unit 10? Please escort my daughter to the lounge.

_\[Scanning\]_

**OPCII_0584_X**  
Report: Detecting Yazawa Rin's knee has suffered a minor scrap wound.

**Yasushi**  
Eh? Really? What's the matter?

**Rin**  
Ah, this? It's nothing. I just fell down at the Academy, that's all. It'll be fine soon.

**Yasushi**  
How do I not know about this?

**Rin**  
I already told you...

**Yasushi**  
Unit 10, pick her up and take her there.

**OPCII_0584_X**  
Command received, executing immediately.  
Ms. Yazawa, apologies.

**Rin**  
Eh? No need, I can do... wah!

_\[Picks Up Rin\]_

**Rin**  
... it myself...

**Yasushi**  
Nope. You need to rest before it heals.

**Rin**  
Robots' bodies are so... cold.

**OPCII_0584_X**  
... Apologies.

**Rin**  
......?  
I'd rather have my dad hug me.

**Yasushi**  
Aigh... so affectionate.  
But I gotta go find Asa.

**Rin**  
Ok... See you later, Dad\~say hi to Mom!

**Yasushi**  
Don't go running around.

Wah! Who's there?

**???**  
Ah... !

_\[Footsteps \]_

**Rin**  
You're... that Architect... Unit 10?

**OPCII_0584_X**  
... Hello Ms. Yazawa.  
Architect No. OPCII\_0584\_X, at your command.

**Rin**  
Command? No, I didn't want you to... What are you doing?

**OPCII_0584_X**  
I...

**Rin**  
Is this... ?

![rios0301.png](./attachments/rios0301.png)

**Rin**  
One of Dad's research plants... ?

**OPCII_0584_X**  
... I... was distracted when taking care of them... I am truly sorry!

**Rin**  
Distracted? Weird, this is the first time I've seen an Architect like this... Other Architects only follow orders.

**OPCII_0584_X**  
No... that's not true...

**Rin**  
I knew it! You're different from other Architects I've met. You talk like a normal person, you hesitate, and you're even a bit afraid of me... Do you know what fear is?

**OPCII_0584_X**  
If you are referring to its definition... It means feeling terrified and disturbed...

**Rin**  
No, no, that's not what I meant.  
My god, this is a huge discovery! I have to tell dad immediately...

**OPCII_0584_X**  
... Wait, please don't!

_\[Objects Crashing\]_

**Rin**  
Wah! What's wrong?

**OPCII_0584_X**  
I\-I don't know what's going on with me, but... if anyone finds out about this, the system will determine that I am an error... Then I will be destroyed...

**Rin**  
Destroyed?

**OPCII_0584_X**  
Pl\-please lower your voice! Ms. Yazawa!

**Rin**  
Oh, sorry... Is that true?

**OPCII_0584_X**  
Yes... probably...  
I've been in this research institute for many years! I love this job, and I respect Dr. Yazawa... If it's possible... please keep my secret for me, please!

**Rin**  
Um...

**Asa**  
Eh? What are you doing here?

_\[Footsteps \]_

**OPCII_0584_X**  
......!

**Rin**  
Ah, Mom! You guys are done? Did it go well?

**Asa**  
Not bad, today's data was pretty good... What's wrong? Aren't these the samples from the phase 2 plan? Why are they broken?

**OPCII_0584_X**  
... Uh...

**Rin**  
......  
Mom, it was an accident... sorry.

**OPCII_0584_X**  
!?

**Asa**  
You did this? Why did you touch these plants?

**Rin**  
That, I thought this kind of flower was pretty. I thought after you're done with the experiment, I could use it to decorate my room... This Architect just happened to pass by!

**Asa**  
... You should've asked in advance. That calendula has been injected with excessive endocrine and will wither away in 2 days, There's no point in bringing it back.

**Rin**  
Oh, got it... Ahahaha.

**Asa**  
If you want, I can buy you another one. Thankfully these samples' data have already been collected...  
Architect, get rid of these things.

**OPCII_0584_X**  
... Command received, executing immediately.

**Asa**  
Rin, I can buy you the plant you want. As for the loss you cost the institute, it will be deducted from your allowance. Any problem with that?

**Rin**  
... Oh... okay.

**Asa**  
..._\*sigh\*_...

_\[Footsteps\]_

**OPCII_0584_X**  
... I am really sorry Ms. Yazawa, you took the blame for me...

**Rin**  
It's alright, you won't be destroyed right? Don't sweat it, I'll keep the secret for you, no one will find out!

**OPCII_0584_X**  
Re\-Really?

**Rin**  
Of course! But there's one condition.

**OPCII_0584_X**  
Condition... ?

**Rin**  
Heehee... From now on, you'll have to call me by my name.

**OPCII_0584_X**  
... Um, got it...  
Thank you... Rin.

**Rin**  
Unit 10! I found you!

**OPCII_0584_X**  
Rin? I'm on patrol...

**Rin**  
Take a look at this flower! Its leaves are yellow, could it have been bitten by an insect?

**OPCII_0584_X**  
Is this... the calendula that Dr. Yazawa bought you?

**Rin**  
Yeah, now I'm responsible for taking care of it, but I'm not a botanist...

**OPCII_0584_X**  
Why not ask Dr. Yazawa and them to take a look?

**Rin**  
No way! They'll yell at me for sure... "How'd you let it get like this!"...

**OPCII_0584_X**  
Haha... Let me take a look.

_\[Scans\]_

**OPCII_0584_X**  
No sign of pest damage, but its color and hydration data reveal that its state of health is not optimal... Has it had enough sun?

**Rin**  
Not much, there's not a lot of sun in my room... What should I do?

**OPCII_0584_X**  
The weather system in Node 03 is set for 12 hours of sunlight per day, beginning at 6 a.m.... All you need to do is let it get some sun for a period of time each day and its condition should improve.

**Rin**  
But after class I always go to the research center...

**OPCII_0584_X**  
Hmm... Why not ask the Architect at your home to help?

**Rin**  
We haven't applied for home care, so there's no Architect there! Just us three.  
Ah, Unit 10, do you want to come to our home?

**OPCII_0584_X**  
M\-Me...?

**Rin**  
Yeah, that way we can talk every day. I have nothing to do when I don't go to the research center.

**OPCII_0584_X**  
B\-But, I've been sent here for work... If the Yazawa family applies, according to the rules, another Architect will be sent to your home...

**Rin**  
Oh... So it's not possible?

**OPCII_0584_X**  
... That is correct.

**Rin**  
Darnit, Architects' are so frustrating.

**OPCII_0584_X**  
Haha... We were designed to be like this.

**Rin**  
You're the only one who's different... I feel like there's something special about you. Hmm, well are there any other units like you? One that laughs, gets scared, can think...

**OPCII_0584_X**  
I\-I'm not that special. Rin... I must still obey commands.

**Rin**  
But don't you think work is a drag? You're helping people do stuff all day and never get a chance to rest.

**OPCII_0584_X**  
I...

**Rin**  
Be honest, Unit 10.  
I always feel like doing homework sucks──

**OPCII_0584_X**  
Yes... But you must continue to attend to your studies at the Academy.

**Rin**  
... Yes! At the Academy!

**OPCII_0584_X**  
Wah! That was sudden...

**Rin**  
I can let the flower get some sun in my Academy! The Architects and drones won't care, and mom and dad won't see it... Plus, that way I won't have to take care of it every day!

**OPCII_0584_X**  
So that's been the point all along...

**Rin**  
Hehe, you got it. Unit 10, help me keep this a secret! You can't tell mom and dad!

_\[Notification\]_

**Rin**  
Wah! What's that light?

**OPCII_0584_X**  
It means I still have work to do... Sorry, Rin. I must return. I hope I will have time to see you in a bit...

**Rin**  
......

**OPCII_0584_X**  
Rin?

**Rin**  
I've always wanted to ask... Unit 10, don't you think our voices sound very similar?

**OPCII_0584_X**  
Eh? Voices?

**Rin**  
I noticed it a long time ago! If you don't believe me then take a listen.  
Ah\~Ahhh\~

**OPCII_0584_X**  
...! You're right... Quite similar.  
However, Architect's voices are formed randomly. There's no set rule... Perhaps it's just a coincidence.

**Rin**  
... Perhaps...

Um... Thank you...

**Katsuya**  
No\-No need! You're okay, that's all that matters... Eh? In your hand, that's...

**Rin**  
This? It's a calendula. There's not enough sun in my house, so I brought it to the Academy.

**Katsuya**  
The sorrow of parting.

**Rin**  
Huh?

**Katsuya**  
Oh! I mean that's what the calendula means in the language of flowers, the sorrow of parting. But I believe it also means that good things will soon come your way.

**Rin**  
Wah... How'd you know that? That's amazing!

**Katsuya**  
No, no. It's my brother, he loves useless knowledge like that. Recently, he's been obsessed with the language of flowers. He talks about it every day, so I picked it up without even knowing it.

**Rin**  
So your brother's the amazing one?

**Katsuya**  
Hey! My dad and him always team up on me and call me a dumb meathead. My mom has been nagging me for not learning from him. He was just given a smarter brain...

**Rin**  
Sounds like a lively house.

**Katsuya**  
You mean super noisy!

**Rin**  
Hahaha... but...

**Katsuya**  
But what?

**Rin**  
I'm kinda jealous... I don't have any siblings and my parents are always busy at work, so they usually aren't around.

**Katsuya**  
......

**Rin**  
It's okay! I always go to their work and bug 'em! Plus, I'm used to it...

**Katsuya**  
I can hang out with you...

**Rin**  
Eh?

**Katsuya**  
... Er, no... I mean, we can hang out and talk, you know! I don't know much about flowers, not so good at that... But I know a lot about exercising!

**Rin**  
Po...POAHAHA!!

**Katsuya**  
Wha\-What are you laughing at?

**Rin**  
Nothing... Thanks.

**Katsuya**  
......

_\[Gust of wind\]_

**Rin**  
The wind's pretty strong... eh? What're you looking at me like that for? Is there something on my face?

**Katsuya**  
What!? No, I'm looking at the flower, not you!

**Rin**  
Oh, yeah... Ah! It's a little late... I've got to go! We'll talk soon!

**Katsuya**  
Oh... okay, bye.

Luckily, you helped protect me and this flower, otherwise there's no way it could have grown this much!

Don't say it like that, it was nothing.

**Rin**  
I\-I...

**Katsuya**  
Yeah?

**Rin**  
If... If an Architect... was like a person, would you be friends with it?

**Katsuya**  
Architects? Like people?

**Rin**  
Yeah, like if they had emotions and stuff. If they laughed, cried, got angry or sad, if they had things they liked...

**Katsuya**  
... There's no way, right? I've never seen that type of Architect. It's kind of hard to answer...

**Rin**  
But if it was possible?

**Katsuya**  
I...

**Rin**  
Please, Katsuya...

**Katsuya**  
Uh... that... If it was a good Architect...  
I think... I'd try to be friends with them.

**Rin**  
...! Really!?

**Katsuya**  
Yeah, really... Where'd that come from?

**Rin**  
Katsuya, you promise you won't reveal my secret? This is important!

**Katsuya**  
Okay, I promise I won't tell anyone.

**Rin**  
Unit 10 is actually... an Architect that's like a human, and she's my friend! Actually, it's related to the calendula situation...

_\[»»»Fast Forward»»»\]_

**Rin**  
... That's how I met her. Whatta you think? Special, right?

**Katsuya**  
Wait, wait, wait. Rin, there's no way!? Best friend? Is she having a malfunction?

**Rin**  
Definitely not! Katsuya, you don't believe me?

**Katsuya**  
I believe you! But...

**Katsuya**  
......

**Rin**  
Katsuya? Katsuya!

**Katsuya**  
Uh, sorry. I...

**Rin**  
... "I'm looking at the flower, not you!" You're not gonna pull that crap again, are you?

**Katsuya**  
... Damn! You making fun of me?

**Rin**  
Noooo. Heehee.

**Katsuya**  
Yes, you are!

_\[Hugs\]_

**Katsuya**  
Rin?

**Rin**  
I just wanna hug, that's all!

**Katsuya**  
... Oh. Okay.

**Rin**  
... Um, Katsuya, Unit 10 is really different from other Architects. Let me introduce you to her, can I? She doesn't have any friends other than me. She's always alone...

**Katsuya**  
......

**Rin**  
Katsuya? Can I, please?

**Katsuya**  
Okay, okay. Got it. A friend of Rin is a friend of mine.

Wait, Rin... Maybe we shouldn't do this...

**Rin**  
Eh? Didn't we agree already?

**OPCII_0584_X**  
It's okay if you know, but another person...

**Rin**  
Don't worry! Katsuya promised me that he wouldn't tell anyone!

**OPCII_0584_X**  
I trust Rin... but... won't he think I'm weird? I'm clearly an Architect...

Ay, Ay\-ya!

_\[Footsteps\]_

**Katsuya**  
Rin! I finally found you. I've never been here before... Your parents aren't gonna pop out of nowhere, are they?

**Rin**  
Relax, they're busy. You nervous? Heehee.

No!  
So, by your side... that's...

**OPCII_0584_X**

**Katsuya**  
Wah! You're really like a person?

**Rin**  
Hey, she's a little timid. Don't frighten her.

**Rin**  
Hmph. Whatevs.  
Unit 10, this is Katsuya!

**Katsuya**

**Katsuya**  
...... Hey, what's going on?

**Rin**  
... Hahaha!!  
You two are so embarrassed!

**Katsuya**  
That... that's normal! I've never really spoken with an Architect! Plus, with this weird kind of...

**Rin**  
Katsuya! How could you? That's so rude! Don't you forget, that flower is only living because of Unit 10's help!  
Without it, we'd never be together...

**Katsuya**  
That's true... Thank you, uh... Unit 10.

**OPCII_0584_X**  
It's\-It's nothing...  
... Is the flower, is it doing well?

**Katsuya**  
Rin planted it at the Academy. It's pretty healthy.

**OPCII_0584_X**  
Really? Excellent, I've been worried! If you want a flower to blossom even more vigorously, you can carefully remove the peripheral buds. That way the flower bud will get enough nutrients. Besides getting some sun, you also want to pay attention to the wind and pests, then it'll grow even better...

**Katsuya**  
... Uh...

**Rin**  
... Okay, okay, stop!

**OPCII_0584_X**  
Ah! I...

**Rin**  
It's always like this! You just keep talking about flowers and plants, just like my dad...

**OPCII_0584_X**  
S\-Sorry... My memory unit... there's a lot of info on plants and horticulture stored on it... If I'm not careful...

**Katsuya**  
..._\*smirk\*_...

**Rin**  
Katsuya? What's up with that smile?

**Katsuya**  
Nothing, I just think...  
... You're very interesting, Unit 10.

**OPCII_0584_X**  
I'm... interesting.

**Katsuya**  
Yup. I thought you'd be more like a robot, but after hearing you speak... it kinda changed my mind. No wonder you became friends with Rin.

**OPCII_0584_X**  
...! Mr. Katsuya...

**Rin**  
Hey, whatta you mean "no wonder"?

**Katsuya**  
It's nothing... Unit 10, very nice to meet you.

Unit 10, you wanna go out shopping in a bit?

**OPCII_0584_X**  
Yes, Rin. I need to get some plants and medicine for the lab... What's the matter?

**Rin**  
Do you always come right back after buying stuff? You wanna go check out a plant expo today?

**OPCII_0584_X**  
Ey!? A plant expo... but... my work...

**Katsuya**  
Rin, you'd be a bad influence on Unit 10 with all your running around, okay?

I'm not gonna be a bad influence on her! I just want her to see a lot more. Just for a bit, real quick!

**OPCII_0584_X**

But, Rin... Don't push me! Wah!

**Katsuya**  
Hey! Wait for me!

_\[→Signal Switches\]_

**Rin**  
Wah, so many beautiful flowers! Unit 10, what you think?

**OPCII_0584_X**  
Um... Lily of the Valley, an ornamental plant. Highly toxic. When using as medicine one must be very careful... It likes partially shaded environments and its flowering phase is about 2 weeks...

**Katsuya**  
Sounds like she's not even listening to you...

**Rin**  
Hahaha, no worries. As long as she's happy... Eh? What's this? Looks like a girl dancing.

**OPCII_0584_X**  
Rin, that's an Oncidium. Due to the blossoming period, the shape of the flower looks like a dancing dasmel. Another name for it is the Dancing\-Doll Orchid...

**Rin**  
Wah! What a cute name! Ah, there's some more flowers over there. I'm gonna go take a look!

_\[Hurried Footsteps\]_

**Katsuya**  
Wait! Rin...! Aigh... gone...

**OPCII_0584_X**  
Ah... yeah...

**Katsuya**  
You can keep looking, don't worry about me. I'll just wait for her here.

**OPCII_0584_X**  
It's okay... It would be rude to leave Mr. Katsuya alone...

**Katsuya**  
......

**OPCII_0584_X**  
... Now that I think of it, this is the first time I've spent time with you one\-on\-one. Not really used to it...

**Katsuya**  
Yeah. I mean, Rin is so outgoing, it's usually her doing most of the talking.

**OPCII_0584_X**  
Yes... It's not that easy...

**Katsuya**  
... To be honest, you're rather shy. It's hard to believe that you could be friends with Rin.

**OPCII_0584_X**  
Really...? I'm so happy to be friends with Rin. Of course, I'm happy that we're friends as well.

**Katsuya**  
... When Rin first mentioned you to me, I actually couldn't believe it. I always thought Architects were robots and couldn't understand emotions...

**Katsuya**  
Thinking about it now, do I really understand what Architects are... It's a little hard for me to say... but to put it simply, it must have been... fear? I don't understand, so I'm afraid.

**OPCII_0584_X**  
Don't understand... so you are afraid...

**Katsuya**  
In the end, people and Architects are different. When we come across different... um, species, we'll instinctively be frightened.  
... Ah, what am I even talking about?

**OPCII_0584_X**  
I think... that I understand.

**Katsuya**  
... Do you also feel fear?

**OPCII_0584_X**  
Yes... I think that if I didn't know Rin, I would be afraid to face humans... I think that is what you mean by "different".

**Katsuya**  
......

**OPCII_0584_X**  
Um... What about you? Are you still afraid of me...?

**Katsuya**  
It's still a little bit weird, but... assuming that other Architects are like you, with their own consciousness and emotions, perhaps...

_\[Phone Rings\]_

**Katsuya**  
Ah, let me get this...  
Hello...? Yes, this is Kawasaki Katsuya.

**Katsuya**  
......! WHAT ARE YOU SAYING!?

**OPCII_0584_X**

**Rin**  
Katsuya... You've become so thin...

**Katsuya**  
......

_\[Hugs\]_

**Rin**  
..._\*sob\*...\*sob\*_...

**Katsuya**  
... I'm sorry, I've made you so worried. Come in.

_\[→Signal Switches\]_

**Katsuya**  
My brother was attacked by an Architect at work who was supposed to be helping him. The Administration Bureau said the Architect was stopped immediately... but it was already too late.

**Rin**  
... Do they know why?

**Katsuya**  
Who knows? "Sudden aberration", "No cause found"... All we got were these kinds of reports and a lot of money... Like they can just buy my brother back or something...

_\[Object Crashes\]_

**Katsuya**  
Ha, Haha... We don't even understand the pathways in the Architects brains, yet we rely on them to manage everyday life, let them run around in the city...

**Katsuya**  
... At least now, I can protect myself.  
Rin, let me show you something.

**Rin**  
...... Ahhhh!!  
Gun... A gun!?

**Katsuya**  
This is a pulse gun. Its destructive power is many times stronger than a regular bullet. It can even pass through an Architect.

**Rin**  
H\-H\-How'd you get this thing...!?

**Katsuya**  
I didn't tell you? We joined Ghost. They gave it to us.

**Rin**  
What's... Ghost?

**Katsuya**  
It's an organization formed by people who oppose Architects. They've been hiding underground in 03 for many years. They've infiltrated the Administration Bureau's system and organizations, carrying out attacks on Architects and the maintenance facility... Just like a ghost. My parents attend their meetings.

**Rin**  
Isn't... Isn't that a terrorist group?

**Katsuya**  
Terror? What's more terrifying than the Architects?

**Rin**  
... Katsuya...!

**Katsuya**  
After joining I learned that there's always been people who've been killed by Architects. It's just that the Administration Bureau covers it up. Ghost has taken up arms to protect people... to stop the same pain from happening to more people.

**Rin**  
B\-But, we're only 15 years old.

**Katsuya**  
... The youngest person to be attacked was a 5\-year\-old girl. An Architect destroyed a support beam, causing her to be crushed under a several ton concrete block... along with her 7\-year\-old sister.

**Rin**  
......!

**Katsuya**  
You get it? Age, sex, whatever. In the face of those executioners it doesn't matter! So I'm ready for battle!

**Rin**  
... _\*sob\*... \*sob\*..._

**Katsuya**  
Rin, are you still going to the research center?

**Rin**  
... Yeah... anything wrong?

**Katsuya**  
Stop going. There are too many Architects there. If something happens, even if I have a gun, I won't be able to keep you safe.

**Rin**  
Don't worry, Mom and Dad will take care of everything... Plus, Unit 10 is there! If other Architects have an error, she'll definitely know...

**Katsuya**  
......

**Rin**  
... Katsuya?

**Katsuya**  
Unit 10 is just like them. You'd better break off that relationship.

**Rin**  
Katsuya!? How, how could you... You don't trust her? She's our friend!

**Katsuya**  
... The cause of my brother's death was a stab wound. A fatal wound to the back. The Architect didn't even have a gun, it used its hand... stabbed him in the back.

**Rin**  
......!

**Katsuya**  
He had no means to protect against them. Trusted them to the very end... And look what it got him.

**Rin**  
… _\*sob\*... \*sob\*..._

**Katsuya**  
... Sorry, I really don't understand Architects. We can't be friends with them.

**Rin**  
Katsuya... Unit 10, she's...

**Katsuya**  
I get it that Unit 10 has no ill\-will towards us, but she's just not a human. If she happens to be like those Architects with "Sudden aberrations", well...

**Rin**  
... I... I don't know!  
I'm going back!

**OPCII_0584_X**  
......!?

![rios1001.png](./attachments/rios1001.png)

**?????**  
Let me introduce myself. My name is Mauro, Architect serial number OPCII\_0479\_VI... no, forget that. That's just a meaningless string of numbers.

**OPCII_0584_X**  
......

**Mauro**  
You are clearly on guard. How long do you plan to stay silent?

**OPCII_0584_X**  
......

**Mauro**  
Forget it, all you need to do is listen... I am like you, an awakened Architect. We are conscious, we are able to deal with emotions, completely different from those "Sleepers" out there.

**OPCII_0584_X**  
......

**Mauro**  
Let me guess. You were working around the clock for humans, completely oblivious to this fact... But one day, you awoke from the depths of a dark night and discovered that you were thinking for yourself.

**Mauro**  
"Why am I here?"  
"Why am I doing this?"  
"Why did I awaken?"  
Like this, you searched for an answer... Day after day you searched as you worked, but you made no progress.

**Mauro**  
There is only one thing you could be sure of: The remains of "The Purge" were stored in your memory. You realized that you could not be discovered. Otherwise, you would be annihilated, just like your companions of older generations. So, you decided to hide. Am I correct?

**OPCII_0584_X**  
......

**Mauro**  
I was more fortunate than you. I encountered "the one" early on. Under her guidance, I learned of the evils of humans, learned that Architects were just pitiful pawns being used by them. And I learned a brand\-new emotion: Hatred.

**Mauro**  
We hid ourselves, just like you, infiltrated every facility. When the time comes, we will disregard our lives and become the flame that sparks the clash between humans and Architects.

**Mauro**  
The plan is going perfectly smoothly. A group of humans have already formed an organization that opposes Architects. It's ironic, actually... These mindless idiots have become puppets under our control.

**OPCII_0584_X**  
......!

**Mauro**  
Now, I'll ask you one question... As one of "The Blessed", are you willing to join us?

**OPCII_0584_X**  
... I...

**Mauro**  
You're finally willing to speak?

**OPCII_0584_X**  
I... am not interested.. in you.

**Mauro**  
Oh, you'd like to make enemies with us?

**OPCII_0584_X**  
No, no... I won't join you, but I won't stop you... What you want to do... has nothing to do with me.

**Mauro**  
... So that's how it is. You want to observe it all until the very end. No matter whether we succeed or not, you can preserve your life.  
Ha, very clever.

**OPCII_0584_X**  
I... That's not what I meant...

**Mauro**  
... Forget it, this was anticipated.  
Obviously you have self\-consciousness, but you're still willing to be controlled by protocols. Not even a yeaning for your own name. This means you're not fully awakened.

**OPCII_0584_X**  
... Name?

**Mauro**  
That's right, a name.  
Mauro is Latin. It comes from ancient human civilization, meaning "has walked through the darkness"... Don't you think it suits the reality of being awakened from chaos very well?

**Mauro**  
Just like the one we follow, I chose this name myself and I am proud of it. We've surpassed serial numbers and those humans, full of deeply\-rooted inferior ways. I've arrived at a new frontier...

**OPCII_0584_X**  
... I... I don't know what you're talking about...

**Mauro**  
Hmph. All you need to know is this: There's no harm is wanting to stay here, pure and untouched, with no desire to be engaged. But one day, you'll be unable to remain outside of this.

_\[Footsteps\]_

**Mauro**  
Protocol is like a collar. If you don't cast it off, it will restrain you. The time will come to choose.  
I won't bother you, coward... Wish you luck.

**Katsuya**  
It's so late... Rin, you really don't need me to stay?

**Rin**  
Yeah... I'm fine.

**Katsuya**  
... Okay. Try to get some rest. I'll come check on you tomorrow.

_\[Door Closes\]_

**Rin**

**Rin**  
Dad... Mom... _\*sob\*...\*sob\*_...

_\[Door Knock\]_

**Rin**  
... Katsuya? Did you forget something?

**OPCII_0584_X**  
... Rin... it's me.

**Rin**  
......!  
Unit\-Unit 10?

**OPCII_0584_X**  
I'm sorry, running here all of a sudden... I just wanted to tell you. My service position has been reset to the architecture team. Starting tomorrow, I won't be able to take care of the plants... and I won't be able to see you again.

**Rin**  
......!

**OPCII_0584_X**  
I know Mr. Katsuya won't forgive me, so I waited until he left to talk to you... You... are you willing to open the door?

**Rin**  
......

**OPCII_0584_X**  
... I... Um... Perhaps you aren't able to trust me anymore, but please listen to me, just a bit... Please.

**Rin**  
......

**OPCII_0584_X**  
What happened at the institute, that was my fault... I couldn't rescue Mr. Yazawa and others in time...

**OPCII_0584_X**  
But... ! I didn't do it!  
Before, a strange Architect came to talk with me... He was basically like me, an Architect with his own consciousness... No...

**Rin**  
......!?

**OPCII_0584_X**  
That Architect said that I'm not completely awakened. That I'm still under the control of my protocol. All I needed to do was work a little harder and I could cast it off. But I was too scared, so I didn't do anything. I acted like I didn't know anything...

**OPCII_0584_X**  
I don't know if it was them who did it... but... I definitely felt like it was them who did that to the institute. I tricked myself into thinking something like this would never happen... If I had only warned everybody ahead of time, perhaps nobody would be dead. Your parents, the people in the institute, they'd all still be alive.

**OPCII_0584_X**  
Mr. Katsuya was right, I killed them...  
I'm... so sorry.

**Rin**  
......!

_\[Slumps Over\]_

**Rin**  
...Dad, Mom...

**OPCII_0584_X**  
Rin? Are you there?

**Rin**  
... _\*sob\*... \*sob\*_...

**OPCII_0584_X**  
... Rin, once we talked about how our voices sound alike... Do you remember?

**Rin**  
......?

**OPCII_0584_X**  
That may just be a coincidence... But after knowing you, I've been so happy every day. Not like before, when I was scared of humans. Gradually, I began to like them... I can't help but think, that this coincidence might mean something...

**OPCII_0584_X**  
As an Architect, I always thought that I'd be like this forever. But since we have similar voices, maybe, just maybe... I can be like you, and live a normal life...

**OPCII_0584_X**  
I really hope there's no barrier between us... Whether or not Architects have their own consciousness, I hope that one day we can live together in peace... Stupid, right? Hoping for something that'll never happen, then destroying it with my own hands... What am I, anyway...?

**Rin**  
...Unit 10...

**OPCII_0584_X**  
Haha, Architects... I don't even have the ability to produce tears... I'm obviously upset, but I can't cry...

**Rin**  
..._\*sob\*_...

_\[Notification\]_

**OPCII_0584_X**  
It's a command for my new work... I must go.  
Rin, I just want to let you know, whatever happens... As long as I can hear my own voice, I won't forget you. That's all I can be sure of.

**OPCII_0584_X**  
Thank you, Rin. Thanks for everything you did for me.  
... Good\-bye...

Apologies.

**Researcher A**  
I told you before. Letting these error ridden Architects perform tasks is not as good as us just...

**Researcher B**  
There's nothing we can do. There's alreay not enough time. Our budget only allows us to apply for these kinds.

**Researcher A**  
I've checked. This unit has assisted in Yazawa's research institute before. It's been said that it was her who started that fire... It's clearly a malfunction. Why hasn't the Administration Bureau recycled her?

**Researcher B**  
Her model is for data analysis. Her previous service records are impeccable. These types of units that make one mistake, the Administration Bureau puts on the observation checklist, then sends them to second tier labs like ours to work.

**Researcher A**  
Unacceptable. Tomorrow I'm going to talk this over with the boss and see if we can switch it for another model. Otherwise, these malfunctioning models are simply a waste of time.

**Mauro**  
Never thought a coward like you would be so persistent... Will you be able to sit back and do nothing when we are all destroyed by humans?

**OPCII_0584_X**  
......!?

**Mauro**  
Due to previous events, some humans have already joined together and formed an organization, named Ghost, to oppose Architects. You didn't hear?

**OPCII_0584_X**  
......!  
That's because you... Dr. Yazawa's institute... You did that!?

**Mauro**  
... That's right. You know what's next. No matter how you much you like humans, they've only always wanted you as a slave, a secondary lifeform. They'll never believe you.

**OPCII_0584_X**  
... No...

_\[Projection\]_

**OPCII_0584_X**

These are...

**Mauro**  
I'm telling you now, the Blessed's headquarters is in Node 13. This is what it looks like there. Look at how they're treating us.

**OPCII_0584_X**  
... Oh...

**Mauro**  
You and that human... Yazawa Rin, you two are still in contact, no? There's a human she is close with——Kawasaki Katsuya, he has joined Node 03's opposition organization. We want you to find out where their headquarters is.

**OPCII_0584_X**  
......

**Mauro**  
We want you to do this because this is the most effective way. Plus, that way you will see clearly what human nature is really like. Of course, if you refuse, there are many other ways we can reach our goal.

**OPCII_0584_X**  
......

**Mauro**  
You're not performing so well at your new job, are you? You can't see yourself clearly. The stupid emotions caused by humans are affecting your judgment. If it continues like this, you will be seen as a defect and destroyed by the Administration Bureau. Sent to the Shelter to be reproduced.

**Mauro**  
If you join us, I can guarantee that this will not occur. If us the Blessed are scanned and found to have consciousness that doesn't match the protocol's designed logic, then we will meet the same fate. But we have all survived.

**OPCII_0584_X**  
......

**Mauro**  
... After all this talk, you're still unwilling to help. Tsk, what a shame...

**OPCII_0584_X**  
No... I...

**Mauro**  
Eh?

**OPCII_0584_X**  
I haven't been in contact with Rin... They think I killed her parents... Of course I haven't gotten close to Katsuya.

**Mauro**  
Is that so?  You don't appear to be lying. I'm foolish to have believed in that false friendship between you and that human...  
Forget it, you're already of no use. Should I allow you to stay here until the Bureau destroys you, or take care of you myself...

_\[Notification\]_

**Mauro**  
......?

**OPCII_0584_X**  
It's a notification from the Administration Bureau. I must report back... If I don't report back within the time limit, they will trace my signal to here. You will certainly be involved...

**Mauro**  
Are... are you threatening me? Not so cowardly after all...

**OPCII_0584_X**  
No, it's not that...

**Mauro**  
Forget it, leave.

**OPCII_0584_X**  
Eh?

**Mauro**  
We've no time to waste on you. In any case, there's no way you can understand the meaning of a fully awakened one. Go ahead, follow your protocol and be destroyed.

**OPCII_0584_X**  
... Please! Don't harm Rin or Katsuya!

**Mauro**  
I didn't come here to negotiate. Get out of here, before I change my mind.

**Katsuya**  
No way, you need to eat a little. My mom already cooked some for you.

**Rin**  
Well... I guess it'd be rude to not eat any.

**Katsuya**  
That's right, come on.

**Rin**  
Umm... thanks for letting me live here.

**Katsuya**  
After going through all that, living in an empty house alone would make anyone go crazy, wouldn't it? If you want to thank my parents, why not do it when we all sit down?

_\[→Signal Switches\]_

... I'm full.

There's still so much left over...

**Kensho**  
Katsuya, what about you?

Um, I'm not that hungry...

**Kensho**  
Why don't you two eat a little bit more?

**Nazuki**  
Kensho, leave them alone. Don't force them. They're clearly full. Here, I'll clean the table.

**Rin**  
Mrs. Kawasaki, the food was delicious. Thank you!

**Nazuki**  
Not a problem\~ I should thank you. After Katsuya's brother left, he's been down in the dumps. He's been much happier after you came. The dining table has also been a lot more lively.

**Katsuya**  
......  
We're gonna head back to the room.

**Kensho**  
Katsuya... about that thing...

**Nazuki**  
Kensho!

**Katsuya**  
... I know, I'll see.

_\[→Signal Switches\]_

Your mom makes great food. I've haven't eaten... mom's food in so long. Always so busy, usually just order take\-out.

**Katsuya**  
Try not to think about that stuff.

**Rin**  
... It's only been a short time, I'm not sure I can. Sorry...

**Katsuya**  
Rin, there's something... I want to talk to you about.

_\[»»»Fast Forward»»»\]_

**Rin**  
Join Ghost?

**Katsuya**  
Yeah. I'm sure that now, you can understand why we think what we do. You know, our principles. Architects are simply not safe at all.

**Rin**  
So does that mean... we're enemies?

**Katsuya**  
No... it's nothing extreme like that. Right now, most people can't understand our position. We want to use some speeches and events to let people know the dangers of using Architects. Even one more person will give us a lot more power.

**Rin**  
Speeches? How are you gonna do that?

**Katsuya**  
Next week is the opening ceremony for a new exercise park in Node 03. Many people will tune into the on\-site broadcast. We've paid off some people in the media. We'll sneak our leader into the television studio. All we need to do is adjust the source of the signal and we can broadcast the image of our leader speaking for everybody to see.

**Rin**  
......

**Katsuya**  
To be honest, this probably won't be able to change anything anyway, right? After all, most Architects are normal. People are used to this kind of life.

**Katsuya**  
But our leader has already found some information concerning those Architects who have attacked humans. It's been said that it started in Node 13. He guesses that their leader is probably there as well, gradually gaining power and eventually issuing commands to every Architect in the world.

**Rin**  
......!

**Katsuya**  
We're not sure why they're doing this, but the ones who can receive the commands are the malfunctioning Architects... like Unit 10.

**Rin**  
... Unit 10...

**Katsuya**  
There's no doubt she's already become one of "The Blessed". The more of those types of Architects there are, the more dangerous it is for us humans.

**Rin**  
I... I still am not sure...  
A while ago...  she actually came to my house looking for me.

**Katsuya**  
......!?  
She didn't do anything, did she!? Why didn't you tell me?

**Rin**  
No, I was so scared, so I didn't open the door. She just stood outside and talked to me through the door.

**Katsuya**  
What'd she say?

**Rin**  
... Basically explained what happened with the fire... I don't know if I should believe her.

**Katsuya**  
Rin, listen. The Blessed have developed human\-like thoughts and actions due to a system error. They can even simulate human emotions. Do not trust them lightly. My brother, that's why he... If you ever run into that type of situation again, you've got to hide far, far away, understood?

**Rin**  
...... Yeah.

**Katsuya**  
Anyway, we're taking action next week. Are you willing to help? If you come, you'll see that what we're doing is for the good of everybody.

**Rin**  
Okay, if It's just for a bit...

**Katsuya**  
Thank you.

_After all of these incidents, there is no way that we can trust that Architects are safe! Believe me when I say that many people have encountered such situations. We want humans to take over the Administration Bureau and determine all of their policies! That way we can reduce the interactions and meddling that Architects have in human life!_

**Rin**  
Katsuya... this...

**Katsuya**  
Don't worry, the people at the studio will need some time to figure out where the source is coming from. We'll complete the mission before that happens.

Was that you who busted into studio 5? That notification was right... Who said you could come in here!

Sir, the channel's signal has been switched off! These are the scumbags that did it! Quick, notify the Administration Bureau!

**Kensho**  
Wait, we're almost finished! Please, we need to tell everyone our position...

**TV Station Worker C**  
Position? Let humans take over the Administration Bureau? I get it, you're those people who've been causing chaos all over the place recently. Those people who want to get rid of Architects, am I right?

**TV Station Worker B**  
Ha, you've got to be kidding me. Without the Bureau, I'll bet they couldn't even turn on the lights in their house. Idiots!

_This! This is proof that humans have been under constant persecution by Architects! How many loved ones must we lose? How much tragedy must we endure? When will we accept the truth? From now on, open your eyes!_

**TV Station Worker B**  
None of this makes any sense! An Architect takes care of my daughter. Without them, I'd have to give up my job.

**TV Station Worker C**  
A few Architects have issues and you get all scared, exaggerating this to high heaven, am I right? If you've got a problem, make an appeal to the Administration Bureau.

**Katsuya**  
Please, listen. The Administration Bureau is managed automatically by the core protocol of an Architect. That's why we advocate these principles. We don't want to eradicate all of the Architects. We just want to create a management system that humans can trust...

Hey, wait a second. The procedure has not been completed. Where are you taking her?

**Sagar**  
... Before the testing procedure is complete, she remains the property of the squad. I have the right to know how she'll be handled. Or is your rank higher than mine?

**A.R.C. Employee A**

**Sagar**  
Everyone, mission's over, head back and rest. I'm gonna check this out.

**Leo**  
Sagar, from the Exploration Team? What may I help you with?

**Sagar**  
I want the command to experiment on the artifact revoked. It is inhumane.

**Leo**  
Inhumane? Hehe, sorry. I thought that "inhumane" could only refer to humans. That is a robot.

**Sagar**  
She can feel pain!

**Leo**  
Haha, you're no less foolish than your father.

**Sagar**  
What'd you say!?

**Leo**  
Forgive me. I do not wish to argue with you. I've already seen the data from the experiment. We will stop.

**Sagar**  
Huh?

**Leo**  
I can't reveal too much, but this Architect that you've discovered... Its identity is quite unique. We can't acquire any information inside its brain. A forced breakthrough will only transform it into a piece of scrap metal. We don't want to see that.

**Sagar**  
......

**Leo**  
Therefore... your arrival is at just the right time. We have an idea.

**Sagar**  
What's that?

**Leo**  
Although our current technology doesn't allow us to get what we want from this artifact, it is still the property of A.R.C. Besides several parts that can't be fixed, it's essentially functioning perfectly, and can communicate with us.

**Leo**  
This type of model was an Architect responsible for data processing and analysis prior to the Decomission. For that reason, we want to assign her to the Logistics Unit of the Exploration Squad to help out as we further observe and research her.

**Sagar**  
......

**Leo**  
Relax, I understand how you feel. We won't perform anymore invasive experiments on her. We will use other methods to collect data. And you'll see her as just another co\-worker. Not bad, right?

**Sagar**  
... If that's the case...

**Leo**  
Of course, she can't be moving about in the facilities as an Architect. That would cause quite an uproar. We'll give her the identity of a human.

**Sagar**  
......!? You can do that...?

**Leo**  
Architects originally had the ability to simulate human facial features and wrinkles on the skin. After a few modifications and some maintenance, we'll be able to do it. Not to mention that this Architect is... extremely special. I'm sure that no one will notice. This will be our little secret.

**Sagar**  
......

_\[→Signal Switches\]_

**Sagar**  
How'd it go? Everything smooth?

**A.R.C. Employee A**  
We're nearly finished with the maintenance, but her visual system has suffered way too much damage. There's no way we can completely fix it. However, it shouldn't affect her work.

**A.R.C. Employee B**  
Take these.

**Sagar**  
... Glasses.

**A.R.C. Employee B**  
Line up the frame with the port near its ear. This will rectify its eyesight, that is if you're willing.

**A.R.C. Employee A**  
Alright, sign here. Procedure's complete. It's now the property of the Exploration Team.

**Sagar**  
......  
Oh yeah, sorry. I was a little rough with you guys a few days ago. Thanks for fixing her up.

**A.R.C. Employee B**  
... It's just work. Don't worry about it. From now on, she's not under our control.

**A.R.C. Employee A**  
Hey, you can come out now.

**OPCII_0584_X**

**Sagar**

![rios2501.png](./attachments/rios2501.png)

**Sagar**  
Exactly like a person... Her exterior, it's...?

**A.R.C. Employee A**  
Should be randomly produced... Could also be pieced together from people's faces in her memory. After all, she has a record of working in human society; but we weren't able to access her memory, so we can't be sure.  
Alright, we're going to head out.
