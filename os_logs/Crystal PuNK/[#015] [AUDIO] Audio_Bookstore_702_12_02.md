**Xenon**<br>
What's the deal with this area?... There are traces of fire everywhere we go.

**Cherry**<br>
It has to do with the chain explosions that occurred. It was huge news and caused quite an uproar. However, I heard that the Administration Bureau sent the victims off somewhere else and never bothered to do anything afterward. Now, no one really cares about what actually happened anymore.

**Xenon**<br>
After all, the poor and the dead can't talk... right?

**Cherry**<br>
Haha, when did you start speaking so poetically like R?

**Xenon**<br>
... Don't drag me down to his level.

**Cherry**<br>
However, in some ways, you two really are eerily similar... We're here.

**Xenon**<br>
A bookstore...? Looks no different than the other destroyed buildings around here...

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Store Clerk**<br>
Welcome.

**Cherry**<br>
... We are looking for a book titled "The Ninth Child".

**Store Clerk**<br>
......

**Cherry**<br>
The certificate is here.

*\[Data projection\]*

**Store Clerk**<br>
... Basement. Shelf B\-9, third level.

**Xenon**<br>
... Aren't you "The Eye of Horus"?

**Store Clerk**<br>
... I don't know what you're talking about. I am just a store clerk of this second\-hand bookstore. Here, enter that door and walk to the end.

*[â†’Signal Switches]*

**Cherry**<br>
...Found it. This book? Wow, an actual paper book...<br>
What a rare sight.

*\[Shelf moves\]*

**Xenon**<br>
......!?<br>
The shelf moved all by itself... there's a door behind it.

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Member D**<br>
So you were the ones who sent over that large sum of money all of a sudden? Didn't even bother to ask first, eh? You guys really are self\-centered.

**Xenon**<br>
... Can't disagree with that.

**Member D**<br>
You don't look like you're from 03... Since you're still able to discover and locate this place, and the amount of money you sent over was truly ridiculous, we figured we should at least meet you... Turns out it was just a bunch of brats?

**Cherry**<br>
......

**Member D**<br>
I'll be honest with you, "The Eye of Horus" doesn't exist anymore. Sending us more money won't change a thing. Please head back. We'll return all the money to the account it was sent from.

**Cherry**<br>
......!? How come...

**Xenon**<br>
... You said "doesn't exist anymore", so this means that it did indeed exist at one point? What happened?

**Member D**<br>
This has nothing to do with you. Please leave.

**Cherry**<br>
No. We have to borrow that ability no matter what. Please! Any clue will help...

*\[Loads gun\]*

**Member D**<br>
I have no interest in your business. If you don't plan on leaving, I don't mind killing you people right here.

**Cherry**<br>
Eh...you want to go?

**[Nora]**<br>
*Daigo, stand down.*

**Member D**<br>
......!?<br>
Chief?

**Xenon**<br>
......?

**[Nora]**<br>
*I know of these two. I'd like to see them. Put the gun away. Bring them to my lab.*

**Member D**<br>
Yes. Please forgive my manners. This way please.

**Cherry**<br>
... Thank you. Let's go, Simon.
