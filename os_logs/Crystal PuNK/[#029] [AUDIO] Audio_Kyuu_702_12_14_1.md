*What... what is going on here? The defense system... is not attacking those drones?*

**Member D**<br>
So the entire system has been hacked into?

**[Nora]**<br>
*Are Diego's hackers actually capable of doing this kind of thing...?*

**Member D**<br>
We certainly underestimated them a bit too much...

**[Nora]**<br>
*Whatever. Daigo, help me get connected. I'll take a look and see what the situation is with the system.*

**Member D**<br>
Yes, Chief.

*\[Connection\]*

**[Nora]**<br>
*What... is this?<br>
...... Ugh!*

**Member D**<br>
Chief! Are you alright!?

**[Nora]**<br>
*The system... has become so bizarre.<br>
Don't worry about me. Grab a weapon and go support the security team. Help them retreat to the central area.*

**Member D**<br>
Chief...!?

**[Nora]**<br>
*Go, now!*

*[â†’Signal Switches]*

*\[Machine Gun\]*

**Kyuu Hou Kai Member A**<br>
AARRGH!!

**Kyuu Hou Kai Member B**<br>
There are way too many of them! Besides, what the hell is this firepower!? I don't recall the admins' drones being such a pain in the a\*\* to deal with...

*\[Explosion\]*

**Member D**<br>
Everyone! Retreat to the central area! I'll provide cover for you guys!

**Kyuu Hou Kai Member B**<br>
Daigo!? What about Chief?

**Member D**<br>
Stop yapping and start running!

*\[Consecutive Gunshots\]*

**Member D**<br>
Hey! Diego! Don't you want me dead real bad!? Then come and get it! This way!

**Kyuu Hou Kai Member B**<br>
Team A! Team B! Retreat! Retreat!

*\[Machine Gun\]*

**Kyuu Hou Kai Member B**<br>
Waaaahh!! They're coming this way!?

**Member D**<br>
!?<br>
They ignored me? Damnit...!

**Cherry**<br>
Out of my way!

*\[Gunshot\]*

**Member D**<br>
!?<br>
Miss Pauline... ROBO\_Head!?

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Mr. Daigo, left arm injured. Non\-life threatening.<br>
Scanning... life signs detected ahead, rescue.*

**Member D**<br>
What are you guys doing here!? How did you get out of that room?

**Cherry**<br>
Be quiet and let us take over here. You grab the others and start running.

**Member D**<br>
... So you guys can handle this...? I'll leave it to you then. Sorry!

*\[Consecutive Gunshots\]*

**Cherry**<br>
Great job! Robohead!<br>
Simon!

*\[Hacking\]*

**Xenon**<br>
... Their actions are different than the ones at Kyubo Medical Center. I can't take care of them all in one go.

**Cherry**<br>
Then we'll do it in multiple tries!<br>
Robohead, one more time. You ready?

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Affirmative.*

*[Signal Lost]*
