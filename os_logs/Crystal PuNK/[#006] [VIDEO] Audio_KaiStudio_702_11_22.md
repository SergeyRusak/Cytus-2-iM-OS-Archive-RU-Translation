*The reporter is at 33rd Boulevard of the Kamikawa area right now. As our viewers can see right now, this is the chaos caused by a complete failure of all traffic lights and some drones experiencing shutdowns or showing abnormal actions. As of now, the Administration Bureau has removed the malfunctioned machines. The reason for the malfunction is still yet to be known. Although this incident didn't cause any harm to security, a blockade line is still drawn and civilians are asked to stay as far away from this area as possible. Similar small\-scale malfunctions also occurred a few days ago at...*

**Xenon**<br>
This is the news here?

**Cherry**<br>
Yeah... This reminds me of something; during our stay at the transportation hub, similar incidents occurred in 08 as well.

**Xenon**<br>
... The actions of these drones...

**Cherry**<br>
You noticed anything?

**Xenon**<br>
No... I'm still not certain. These drone models are completely different from the ones in 08.<br>
But... I have a bad feeling about this.

**Cherry**<br>
My mom... was a victim of a drone malfunction too...

**Cherry**<br>
Mommy, why are you so good at singing?

**Luis**<br>
It really is a shame that you didn't become a singer for how amazing your voice is.

**Cherry**<br>
Singer...?

**Luis**<br>
Yes, someone who can stand on a big stage and sing to many people, making everyone mesmerized. Daddy was first attracted to mommy because of her singing voice. In a bustling transportation center, I suddenly heard this beautiful voice coming from afar. 

**Carly**<br>
Awww! What are you saying in front of the child? Ah, are you leaving already? It's still pretty early.

**Luis**<br>
After you changed to part\-time shifts, my workload practically doubled...

**Carly**<br>
Oh, SORRY about that!

**Cherry**<br>
Is daddy going to work?

**Luis**<br>
That's right. Do you want to come with daddy? You'll get to see all kinds of people from all over the world at the transportation center.

**Carly**<br>
Stop talking this nonsense... Ah, Luis, look at you. Your necktie is all messed up.

**Luis**<br>
Oh, thank you, Carly. Then I'll be on my way. Love you.

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Carly**<br>
Hmph, what singer? You can't do anything without me around. Always saying such dumb things... hehehe.

**Cherry**<br>
Mommy, you want to be a singer...?

**Carly**<br>
... Idiot, right now, mommy needs to work, take care of this family and take care of you. Mommy is very happy right now.

**Cherry**<br>
Hmm... mommy needs to take care of me... then I'll be a singer when I grow up! Mommy, teach me how to sing~

**Carly**<br>
Hahaha, can you really do it? Alright then, let's begin!

**[Luis]**<br>
*Carly, I'm getting off work soon. Where are you now?*

**Carly**<br>
I'm on our way home too. Sorry for dumping all the work onto you... I just bought the ingredients for dinner. Ah, I also bought Sherry's cake, look. She got first place in her music classroom. She deserves a good reward.

**[Luis]**<br>
*Haha, the strawberry cake from Giraffe House, is it? She'll be very happy when she sees it.*

**Carly**<br>
Don't spill the beans when you pick her up though. I want to give her a surprise.

*\[Commotion\]*

**[Luis]**<br>
*... What's the matter? What's that noise?*

**Carly**<br>
No idea... I think there's a car accident ahead...?

**[Enforcer Drone]**<br>
*You are... causing harm to civilians. P\-p\-please...stop...*

**Carly**<br>
Eh...? Are there criminals? How scary...

**[Luis]**<br>
*You should stay away...*

*\[Drone flying\]*

**[Enforcer Drone]**<br>
*You are causing... h\-hhhharm to ccivilians. P\-please... stop...*

**Carly**<br>
M... me? It must be some kind of misunderstanding. I didn't do any...

**Agent A**<br>

**Agent A**<br>
This is Squad 06 Law Enforcement agent Andrew Wood! A LE\-110 has been hit by a criminal and has malfunctioned. Request technician support to shut down its program!
