**Member D**<br>
Come in.

**Cherry**<br>
......

**[Nora]**<br>
*Both of you, you don't have to be so nervous. Take a seat.*

**Cherry**<br>
Umm, thank you. And you are...?

**[Nora]**<br>
*I'm Nora, the Chief of Kyuu Hou Kai.*

**Xenon**<br>
......!? You're... the child...<br>
in KAI's photos...?

**[Nora]**<br>
*No need to be so surprised. You also made quite a name for yourself when you were just a child, didn't you? Mr. Simon Jackson? Or should I call you "X"?*

**Xenon**<br>
......!

**[Nora]**<br>
*I've seen your lively record on the Dark Web. Unable to be tracked, unable to be guarded against. The mysterious hacker who has given many a headache to the gangs. Quite impressive, I must say.*

**Xenon**<br>
... Those records should've all been deleted by myself a long time ago.

**[Nora]**<br>
*The world of the internet is much more vast than what you had imagined. In reality, those records still exist in a place that you are unable to access. And I... am someone who is able to do so.*

**Cherry**<br>
You... Could it be, that you're "The Eye of Horus"?

**[Nora]**<br>
*... Let's change the topic. The attack on the Kyubo Medical Center building a few days ago. The brave anonymous heroes... That was you two, wasn't it?*

**Cherry**<br>
......!?<br>
......

**Xenon**<br>
...So Kyuu Hou Kai's the one behind Kyubo Medical Center? I've come across similar rumors. If that's the case, it'd be impossible to not be noticed by you.

**[Nora]**<br>
*Indeed. We hadn't been expecting that attack. If it hadn't been for your timely assistance, the entire hospital building would've been overrun before anyone could escape. The casualties would have been enormous. This is also precisely why I was willing to see you two.*

**Xenon**<br>
But... some people were still caught in the crossfire, weren't they?

**[Nora]**<br>
*The data I received reported 2 dead and 17 injured. Half of the facilities were destroyed. Unable to provide medical service for three months.*

**Xenon**<br>
... Damnit...

**Cherry**<br>
... Miss Nora, if you knew of Simon's identity already, then you must know that he...

**[Nora]**<br>
*Of course. I know that during the jury, you admitted that you were Æsir, but then escaped from 08's restricted ara. Since you're now here and asking to use "The Eye", it must have something to do with that... As with me, I must confirm whether or not your intentions will affect Kyuu Hou Kai.*

**Cherry**<br>
If it does affect, you won't help...?

**Xenon**<br>
Sherry.<br>
Nora, the reason I want to clear this incident up is not for myself. I believe that hiding behind all the things we have experienced so far, there lies a secret which will affect the entire world…

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

**[Nora]**<br>
*I see...You believe that if you don't reveal these secrets, the dangers that come with it may end up impacting all humans.*

**Cherry**<br>
Yes. Please, we need your help!

**[Nora]**<br>
*I'm sorry, but I can't help.*

**Cherry**<br>
……!?<br>
Why? We already told you everything...

**[Nora]**<br>
*I approve of your motives, and this "hypothesis" is certainly quite intriguing. But there are many doubts that I am unable to verify right now... As you can see, my eyes are already in very bad shape. If not for the aid of devices, making out your outlines alone would be a difficult task.*

**Cherry**<br>
......!<br>
So The Eye of Horus really doesn't exist anymore...?

**[Nora]**<br>
*That's right. Entering the OS space is very demanding for my body. My current limit is a mere 5 minutes. Plus, I can only see information around 03. Focusing my mind and go to wherever I'd like is certainly out of the question too. This is also why Daigo was trying to drive you guys away back there. Please forgive him.*

**Xenon**<br>
OS space...?

**[Nora]**<br>
*... It was chosen arbitrarily. The name is not important.*

**Cherry**<br>
Is there no other way...?

**[Nora]**<br>
*...You two are in luck. Coincidentally, someone else who can use this same ability is currently under my care.*

**Cherry**<br>
For real!?

**[Nora]**<br>
*But her condition… I'm not sure if she can be much help, since she has yet to fully master this power. If you two don't mind...*

**Cherry**<br>
Please, let us see her!

**[Nora]**<br>
*Hmm…… This is also to repay you the favor for saving the civilians.<br>
Please wait outside for a moment. I'll take you to see her.*

**Xenon**<br>
...Thank you.

*\[Door Closes\]*

**[Nora]**<br>
*... Daigo, what would you like to say?*

**Member D**<br>
I knew I couldn't keep it from the Chief... Concerning the hospital attack. I believe the culprit behind the attack is already quite clear.

**[Nora]**<br>
*You believe that the attack was a joint effort of the Baro Brotherhood and Mogura.*

**Member D**<br>
Of course. Chief, you've already heard the things I recorded. That rat scum Diego planned everything all along. He's teaming up with Ryu to gobble up our forces and turf!

**[Nora]**<br>
*I don't care about any of that. However… if the many technologies developed by Kyuu Hou Kai ends up in their hands, all of Node 03 will suffer greatly.*

**Member D**<br>
... What if we take the initiative?

**Nora**<br>
......

**Member D**<br>
Kyuu Hou Kai's military power and equipment far surpass those worthless hacks. Even if we don't have as many people as them, so long as we land the first strike, we'll definitely win! Let's bite the head off the dragon before they have a chance to strike!

**[Nora]**<br>
*... You want to start a war?*

**Member D**<br>
......

**[Nora]**<br>
*No. Setting Mogura aside, the Baro people don't mind if they burn everything to the ground. You saw how they went about trying to "warn" us... I don't want to get ordinary people involved.*

**Member D**<br>
Chief!

**[Nora]**<br>
*This is not worth considering. You are not allowed to have such ideas anymore. I will find another way to handle this. Okay, let's go greet the guests.*

**Member D**<br>
... Yes, Chief.

*[Signal Lost]*
