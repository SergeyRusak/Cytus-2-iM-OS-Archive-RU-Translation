**KAI**<br>
Here, gimme your hand.

**Cherry**<br>
I can climb it myself just fine.

**Xenon**<br>
We're really here... Node 03.

**KAI**<br>
Welcome.

**Xenon**<br>
KAI... It's been a long time.

**KAI**<br>
Yeah. I've heard everything from JOE.

**Cherry**<br>
Everything, is it...?

**Xenon**<br>
I'm really sorry. Never had the chance to properly explain things to you.

**KAI**<br>
Nah, it's fine. Like you've always said "That's all in the past now.", right?

**Cherry**<br>
Sorry... Why are you still willing to help us even after knowing all those things?

**KAI**<br>
Why... No particular reason really. We're friends, right? Even though we haven't been in contact for so many years, our friendship is still there, at least that's what I believe.

**Xenon**<br>
KAI...

**KAI**<br>
Besides, I'm a kid who grew up in Node 03. I've seen what real "bad guys" are like. Compared to them, what you guys did is nothing noteworthy at all.

**Cherry**<br>
......

**KAI**<br>
Now that you guys are here, you don't need to worry about that stuff anymore. The rules here are completely separated from other Nodes. That's why there are so many hardcore guys gathered here. I'd advise you guys to be more careful yourself too.

**Xenon**<br>
Got it. Is there a place we can stay for now?

**KAI**<br>
Come with me. There's an instrument storage room we don't use anymore. You guys can stay there temporarily.

**Xenon**<br>
"Mountain Breeze Musique", is it?

**KAI**<br>
Yep. After I came back, I took over my parents' business. We've got more and more branch locations in other places. You guys probably saw the branch in 08, right? In short, I'm doing pretty well these days.

**Cherry**<br>
Good to hear!

**KAI**<br>
However, the music environment here is still nowhere near as free as 08. Anything that involves money and benefits will be placed under scrutiny by the admins... *\*Sigh\**, I really miss the band days with you guys.

**Cherry**<br>
The opportunity will definitely come! After all of this is over and Simon is proven innocent... we can start from zero, right?

**Xenon**<br>
... Yes. We still have yet to achieve our goal of hosting a music festival together.

**KAI**<br>
Haha, you don't get to talk. You two breaking up really screwed me over back then.

**Xenon**<br>
Hey, I said I was sorry.

**Cherry**<br>
We're really, really sorry!

**KAI**<br>
... I was just kidding. I'm relieved to see that both of you haven't changed much.

**Cherry**<br>
Expecting any sort of change from this blockhead is basically a pipe dream.

**Xenon**<br>
Don't ruffle my hair.

**KAI**<br>
Haha, same goes for you, big sis.

**Cherry**<br>
Eh? Me? I've changed quite a bit, right? I even cut my hair...

**KAI**<br>
No, what I mean is that after experiencing all those things, you are still oozing so much positive energy, just like you were back then. It gives people this lively energy that's hard to describe... I can still hear these things in your current music.

**Cherry**<br>
... Haha, what the heck? I'm... not that great of a person.

**KAI**<br>
I'm serious. In a place like 03... I've seen many people who never dug themselves out of the hole after tasting what it's like to be evil. "Change the world with our power"... perhaps those days back then were the only time we could say stuff like that.

**Cherry**<br>
......

**KAI**<br>
Compared to me, both you and Simon are still working hard to spread your music. JOE is also trying to find a place in that circle in his own way. I'm the only one who's still just going with the flow. In all honesty, I'm a little jealous of you guys, be it back then or right now.

**Xenon**<br>
KAI, could it be... that you've experienced some bad things yourself too?

**KAI**<br>
Pfft, please, I'm a rare model citizen of 03. Sheltering you two bastards like this is probably the most "evil" thing I've ever done.

**Cherry**<br>
Thanks...

**KAI**<br>
Speaking of which, big sis, how are you gonna handle your business in 08? You know, the performances and stuff.

**Cherry**<br>
No worries. The next string of events is all done in the virtual internet. I can take care of them from here.

*\[Drones flying\]*

**Cherry**<br>
Look out! Patrol drones!

**KAI**<br>
Oh? That? Nah, no need to be scared. The admins here only mind their own business. Even if you stab someone on the streets, they'll completely ignore it. Of course, that depends on who you stabbed.

**Xenon**<br>
Are you serious... I've visited 03 before, never noticed how bad the public security here was...

**KAI**<br>
You've been here before?

**Xenon**<br>
Yeah. Last year, I came here with NEKO to participate in a new year's event.

**KAI**<br>
NEKO? Oh, that famous cyTuber.

**Cherry**<br>
......

**KAI**<br>
We're here. Come on in. I must warn you though, it's really dirty inside. You guys might have to clean it up a bit.
