*[Call Starts]*

**Cherry**<br>
Who is this? How did you know this number?

**[STANley]**<br>
*Hello!? Big sis? It's me!*

**Cherry**<br>
JOE!? Thank goodness, you're fine! I totally thought you were dead!

**[STANley]**<br>
*Dead my a\*\*! I'm alive and well, okay!*

**Cherry**<br>
... What are you calling from?

**[STANley]**<br>
*I borrowed a phone from a pedestrian! My shop got blown up for no apparent reason and I was busy helping other victims until moments ago. My phone is likely still buried under all the rubble of my shop.*

**[STANley]**<br>
*Borrowed my a\*\*... You just came up and grabbed my phone you bastard...*

**[STANley]**<br>
*Come on, don't be so stingy. It's not like it's a long call...*

**Cherry**<br>
JOE? What is happening?

**[STANley]**<br>
*Nothing, nothing at all! Just want to tell you guys that I'm safe! Ah, one more thing. Yesterday, Punk got hit with a bad case of diarrhea so I sent him to the pet hospital to rest for a few days. It seems the area around there wasn't affected by the explosions.*

**Cherry**<br>
Haha, guess Punk got pretty lucky this time... Got it. Thanks a lot.

**[STANley]**<br>
*Aww, no need to be so polite. What about you guys? Everything alright over there?*

**Cherry**<br>
Yeah, so far so good. Looks like the incident this time is quite serious?

**[STANley]**<br>
*Oh, "serious" doesn't even begin to describe how bad this is! I didn't see it personally, but folks have told me that a whole group of drones suddenly arrived on site and started blowing s\*\*\* up! On top of that, their attacks were all targeted at key facilities and the business district!*

**Cherry**<br>
Diego... you...

**[STANley]**<br>
*What? Is Diego behind all this?*

**Cherry**<br>
... Pretty much all but confirmed at this point. He has already admitted that the previous incident at Kyubo Medical Center was his handiwork. We speculate that he wants to use these attacks as sort of a practice run for taking down Kyuu Hou Kai.

**[STANley]**<br>
*That bastard... Big sis, we must stop him!*

**Cherry**<br>
We will. You settle yourself down first. You should be able to do that, right?

**[STANley]**<br>
*No worries. Even though my shop was trashed, I still know quite a few people. I won't have any trouble continuing my business too. Hahaha!*

**Cherry**<br>
Haha, how trustworthy. Then we'll be asking for your help once the time arrives.

**[STANley]**<br>
*Hey, are you done yet...*

**[STANley]**<br>
*Woah! Big sis, I'll be hanging up now! Will get in touch again once I settle things down!*

**Cherry**<br>
Gotcha. We'll be in touch.

*[Call Ends]*
