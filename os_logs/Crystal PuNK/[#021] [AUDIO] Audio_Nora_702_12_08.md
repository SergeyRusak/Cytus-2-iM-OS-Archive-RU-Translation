*Player NEKO\#ΦωΦ WIN!*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Yeah!

**Cherry**<br>
Damnit... I lost!

**PAFF**<br>
NEKO is so amazing!

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Muhaha~ sorry about that, Sis Cherry, but NEKO never goes easy on my opponents when it comes to rhythm games!

**Hayato**<br>
You've never gone easy on anybody no matter what game we play...

*\[Door Opens\]*

**[Nora]**<br>
*Miss Kaori Minamiya, it's time.*

**PAFF**<br>
Oh, ok. Sorry, but I have to go with Nora now.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Nora\-chan, why don't you come and play a round? The top of the leaderboard is almost all you! Ah, although NEKO has taken over around have of it already.

**[Nora]**<br>
*......<br>
Daigo. Go play with them. Make sure our guests have a good time.*

**Member D**<br>
M\-M\-Me?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Eh~? NEKO only wants to play with the best. I don't wanna play with this guy.

**[Nora]**<br>
*Daigo is quite skilled himself too.<br>
Let's get going.*

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Member D**<br>
......

**[Game Console]**<br>
*Player NEKO\#ΦωΦ vs. Player Daigo, Begin!*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Hey, are you really as good as she said? NEKO ain't going easy on you.

**Cherry**<br>
Nora is still so hard to get close to... She doesn't feel like the small child she actually is at all.

**Member D**<br>
No, Chief has... Ever since all you people came here, she has indeed changed, albeit just a little. <br>
I haven't heard her speak as much as she does recently in a very, very long time.

**Hayato**<br>
So that counts as "much"...?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Old guy, Ropohead told us all about Nora's story. Don't you feel sorry for her? And Ropohead!

**Member D**<br>
......<br>
I'm the Chief's right\-hand man. All I can do is help her whenever something I can do comes my way. Chief is just way too smart. There's no way ordinary people like us can understand what she feels.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Is it really that complicated? We've got a genius with us right here yet it's so damn easy to read what he's thinking. Right, Sis Cherry?

**Cherry**<br>
Haha! Well said. <br>
Speaking of which, where is him? I haven't seen him for a while now.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Whatever, bet he's sitting in some random corner fiddling with his device all by himself again.

*[→Signal Switches]*

**[Xenon A.I.]**<br>
*... Connection failed. Retry searching for the terminal.*

**Xenon**<br>
Damn... so this doesn't work either?

**[Nora]**<br>
*Good evening, Mr. Simon Jackson.*

**Xenon**<br>
Nora, PAFF.

**[Nora]**<br>
*Your A.I. and connection device are... very unique. May I ask: what are you doing now?*

**Xenon**<br>
Just waiting around like this isn't going to achieve anything. Thus, I've used a few methods to track the connections of Æsir and Library, but... I've never seen a break like this. The signal just disappears into thin air when it reaches a certain location...

**[Nora]**<br>
*... Did you use our equipment?*

**Xenon**<br>
Yes. Rest assured. I've improved your firewall. Apologies for changing the algorithms without permission. However, I found obvious loopholes here, here and here. Couldn't ignore them. They're much more secure now.

**[Nora]**<br>
*... Hacking into Kyuu Hou Kai's network in broad daylight like this, if this is any other organization, you would've been dealt with already. However... your points are valid. Even I didn't notice these loopholes... The circuit method, is it? Very interesting.*

**Xenon**<br>
Due to that incident at Kyubo Medical Center a few days ago, I already have a good understanding of the methods those hackers Baro hired use to hack into the drones. They're at least ten years away from breaking through this algorithm.

**[Nora]**<br>
*... To be honest, it has been a very long time since I've been genuinely surprised by someone else's skills in cyTus technology. Your reputation as "X" was indeed well\-earned. Thank you again.*

**Xenon**<br>
No, I've also learned quite a few things myself from this firewall you wrote. Are you two going to do the training next?

**PAFF**<br>
Yes. Today, I will once again try to connect to safer locations in Node 08.

**Xenon**<br>
Got it. Be careful.

**PAFF**<br>
We will.

*\[Footsteps\]*

**Xenon**<br>
Ah... Ummm...

**PAFF**<br>
What's the matter?

**Xenon**<br>
... I know it's a bit weird for me to say this in these circumstances, but... I hope all this can be over soon and you can resume singing again. That's all.

**PAFF**<br>
Haha, the other girls always said that although you're smart, you're very easy to read. I can kind of see that now.

**Xenon**<br>
... Perhaps that really is the case.

**PAFF**<br>
It really is a coincidence that so many musicians are gathered here. After we go back, everyone will be able to continue making music. That includes you, Xenon. I really like your songs.

**Xenon**<br>
... Thank you.

**PAFF**<br>
Same goes for you too, Nora. It would be great if you can continue making music.

**[Nora]**<br>
*......<br>
We focus on the task ahead for now.*
