……!

**Cherry**<br>
... Where is this...? Oh, yeah. I'm at Kyuu Hou Kai. <br>
... Dreamed about those things again...

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

*\[Singing\]*

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Xenon**<br>
...Can't sleep?

**Cherry**<br>
Oh, did I wake you up?

**Xenon**<br>
I haven't slept yet. I can hear your voice.

**Cherry**<br>
*\*shivers\**... Yikes, it's so cold... The winter in Node 03 really is freezing.

**Xenon**<br>
The weather system here hasn't been fully recreated like in Node 08. The differences in temperature are much larger. Do you want me to close the window?

**Cherry**<br>
It's okay. I wanna look at the night scenery a bit more.

**Xenon**<br>
At least put on another coat? You don't want to catch a cold. Here.

**Cherry**<br>
You don't need one?

**Xenon**<br>
I was just optimizing their equipment in the server room with Nora. It's really damn hot in there. Here, take it.

**Cherry**<br>
Here he is, good guy Simon.

**Xenon**<br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Quit your blabbing... <br>
Were you singing "Still" just now? Haven't heard you sing that one for a while.

**Cherry**<br>
... I was just humming, that's all.

**Xenon**<br>
……<br>
I've mentioned to my friend in the Administration Bureau about the threats Diego made regarding our families. You don't have to worry about it too much.

**Cherry**<br>
You mean the Nate you mentioned before? The one who let you escape in the restricted area.

**Xenon**<br>
Yeah.

**Cherry**<br>
... Why are you telling me this all of a sudden?

**Xenon**<br>
You said before that when you're feeling distressed, you'll sing that song. So, I made a quick guess.

**Cherry**<br>
I'm fine... It's just... I remembered some things again.

**Xenon**<br>
......

**Cherry**<br>
That previous apology... I feel like I was a total mess when I said it. But I still want to say I'm sorry once more. Perhaps I'm still unable to forgive myself, but... can you?

**Xenon**<br>
Didn't I already tell you? You need to let go of the past. If you don't, there's no way you'll ever move forward. Whether or not we can forgive those things is no longer important.

**Cherry**<br>
Yeah... you're right.

**Xenon**<br>
*\*Yawn\*\~*

**Cherry**<br>
So you do yawn? What a rare sight.

**Xenon**<br>
I haven't slept in two days... I probably should actually sleep. You ought to sleep early as well. Tomorrow, we'll use PAFF's ability to check for some more clues. I'll need you to provide me some information on what happened back then.

**Cherry**<br>
I want to feel the breeze for a little longer. I'll sleep soon.

**Xenon**<br>
Oh, then I'll leave this coat here.

**Cherry**<br>
Eh? I don't want it. It's got that sweat stink of yours on it. Take it.

**Xenon**<br>
Really? Let me take a whiff... It's not that bad, isn't it?

**Cherry**<br>
Oh, it's QUITE bad. Take it already.

**Xenon**<br>
Hey, there's something inside. Don't throw it... ah!

**Cherry**<br>
Wahh!

*\[Falls down\]*

**Xenon**<br>
......

**Cherry**<br>
... Owww...!

**Cherry**<br>
......

*\[Stands up\]*

**Xenon**<br>
... I'm gonna sleep now, goodnight.

**Cherry**<br>
... Yeah, goodnight.

*\[Footsteps\]*

**Xenon**<br>
......<br>
I... I forgave you a long time ago. Don't ask that anymore.

**Cherry**<br>
......<br>
... Thank you.

*\[Door Opens\]*

*\[Crashing\]*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Waah!?

**Xenon**<br>
NEKO... What are you doing?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Eh? Ahahaha... it's... umm... ah! Yes! There's huge news on iM! Things got really, really bad!! Another large\-scale terrorist attack has occurred in Node 08! It's very close to uncle JOE's shop! NEKO is here to tell you guys that!

**Xenon**<br>
WHAT!?

**Cherry**<br>
What's happening!?
