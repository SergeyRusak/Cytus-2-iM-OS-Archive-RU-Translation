**Zhang**<br>
Hahaha! Eat and drink all you want! It's my treat! If you see it, I'll pay for it!

**Member**<br>
Thank you, brother Zhang!

**Cherry**<br>
......

**Zhang**<br>
Hey, why isn't that bastard Diego here yet? Doesn't he know that I, Mr. Zhang, really hates it when people are late?

**Cherry**<br>
He's busy with something else. He'll be here very soon. If you don't mind, I'll drink with you until he gets here.

**Zhang**<br>
Oh? I didn't think that Node 08 would have decent goods too... Sweetie, you look like you're still a student, aren't you? Hehe. I see that Diego really knows how to party. You sure you can handle me?

**Cherry**<br>
If you're asking whether or not I can hold my liquor... That's not an issue.

**Zhang**<br>
Who said anything about drinking!? I'm talking about something else... Hoho? Not exactly busty, but you sure have a damn good figure... Hehehe, let me check the goods myself...

**Cherry**<br>
......!?

**Zhang**<br>
What's the matter? Don't you give me such an unhappy expression. The organization sent you here to make me happy, didn't they? Do you not realize how important this transaction is? Hehehe...

**Cherry**<br>
... Oh...

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Zhang**<br>
Eh? You're finally here, Diego? This girl you choose ain't half bad. I like her. So, whaddaya think? Since we're talking about the business of girls, we might as well take this one too...

**Diego**<br>
Do you mind taking your filthy hands off of her, brother Zhang?

**Zhang**<br>
Huh? What did you say? Did I mishear you? How dare you talk to me like...

*\[Loads gun\]*

**Diego**<br>
I'm not kidding. This lady doesn't belong to our organization, but she is still an important property of 08's underground society. Please take your filthy hands off of her, and then we can talk business.

**Zhang**<br>
... Hey... Don't be so serious. I took 'em off, didn't I? See? I didn't harm her at all.  No need to be so tense. Put the piece down, 'kay? Haha...

**Diego**<br>
You can leave now. You did well.

**Cherry**<br>
......

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Angus**<br>
Did you steal the item we requested from him?

**Cherry**<br>
... Here. Next time, don't come to me if the operation doesn't involve combat...

**Angus**<br>
That's not for me to decide.

**Xenon**<br>
Sherry? Why are you here all of a sudden?<br>
... Why are you dressed up like this?

**Cherry**<br>

**KAI**<br>
Okay. That felt really good. A quick break first. We'll continue afterward.

*\[Ringtone\]*

**Cherry**<br>
Ah, let me answer the phone.

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

**Cherry**<br>
... No way...

**Xenon**<br>
What's wrong?

**Cherry**<br>
My father, he...!

*[→Audio\_Hospital01\_696\_05\_10]*

**Cherry**<br>
Father! What happened!?

**ER Doctor**<br>
I don't know. Some people found him collapsed on side of the road covered in blood.

**Xenon**<br>
Gunshot wound......?

**Cherry**<br>
......

**ER Doctor**<br>
I'm sorry, Miss Pauline. Your father has already lost too much blood. We need to do an emergency blood transfusion right away, but we don't have any AB type blood in our storage that matches his condition...

**Xenon**<br>
My blood type is AB!

**ER Doctor**<br>
Really!? Are you willing to undergo a blood transfusion checkup...

**Xenon**<br>
Whatever! Let's get on it!
