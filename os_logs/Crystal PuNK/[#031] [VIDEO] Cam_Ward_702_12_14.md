**Xenon**<br>
What is her situation?

**Kyuu Hou Kai Member**<br>
Mr. Jackson, apologies in advance, but before you enter this ward, please place all transmitting devices outside.

**Xenon**<br>
I don't mind... but why?

**Kyuu Hou Kai Member**<br>
Chief will explain it to you later.<br>
Miss Pauline's injuries are not serious. We've finished treating all of them. However, her condition is still recovering. As of now, she has yet to regain consciousness.

**Xenon**<br>
... She...

*\[Door Opens\]*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Sis Cherry! Waaaaahhhhh!

**[Nora]**<br>
*Please remain silent.*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Oh...

**[Nora]**<br>
*Mr. Simon Jackson, please be at ease. She won't be waking up for a while. I programmed it to be that way.*

**Xenon**<br>
Nora... What do you mean?

**[Nora]**<br>
*She has slight signs of a concussion. We scanned her brainwaves and discovered some abnormalities. Perhaps it's related to the fact that during the impact, your device had a sudden surge that may have affected her mind.*

**Xenon**<br>
... It's all my...

**[Nora]**<br>
*Please don't fault yourself. You two are heroes who saved everyone... the second time you've done so too. Miss Sherry Pauline is guaranteed to make a full recovery. Please leave it to me.*

**Xenon**<br>
For real? Thank you.

**[Nora]**<br>
*We should be the ones thanking you two.*

**PAFF**<br>
We have to say thank you to you as well.

**Hayato**<br>
No kidding. Even though I tried to stop you guys rushing out the room back there... Sorry, I couldn't do anything...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Yeah! You guys are everyone's hero! Though your methods are very reckless~

**Xenon**<br>
You don't get to lecture me on that...

*\[Knocks on head\]*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Oww! That hurt!

**Xenon**<br>
These words of gratitude, you should tell them to Sherry. She'll be much more elated than me. <br>
When will she wake up?

**[Nora]**<br>
*The life support system and virtual device are currently repairing and stabilizing her mind. Meanwhile, they are providing her with the nutrients she needs and transfusing the blood she lost. In approximately a few hours, she'll be able to make a full recovery. *

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Amazing. Just this one giant machine and you can automatically heal a person!

**Xenon**<br>
Nora, you look... terrible. Did something happen?

**[Nora]**<br>
*No... It's not related to Miss Sherry Pauline's situation. It's just that... when I was releasing the defense system from the hacking... ugh... I ran into... some issues...*

**Member D**<br>
Chief, please return to your toom and get some rest.

**[Nora]**<br>
*No, I'm fine.<br>
The alarm has been disabled. Everyone, please return to your rooms. This place is not designed to house so many people. The chips we have will interrupt the system's operations.*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Eh~ NEKO wants to stay here with Sis Cherry though...<br>
Can't help it then; let's go to PAFF's room to play some games!

**Hayato**<br>
Why are you so carefree about this whole thing...?

**[Nora]**<br>
*......<br>
Alright. Everyone, leave the room so the treatment process can continue.*

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Xenon**<br>
......

**[Nora]**<br>
*What's the matter?*

**Xenon**<br>
Excuse me, but I want to stay here... Can I?

**[Nora]**<br>
*......<br>
Alright. You didn't bring your device in, did you?*

**Xenon**<br>
Yeah.

**[Nora]**<br>
*Miss Sherry Pauline is still not completely out of danger yet. Before the automatic treatment procedure is complete, please be careful. This life support system is very precise and delicate. Try your best to avoid touching anything.*

**Xenon**<br>
Understood.

**[Nora]**<br>
*... Mr. Simon Jackson.*

**Xenon**<br>
Hmm?

**[Nora]**<br>
*Once she wakes up, there's something I want to tell you and the others.*

**Xenon**<br>
What is it?

**[Nora]**<br>
*I hope to tell it in a situation where everyone is present... The clues you brought, I may have figured some things out...*

**Xenon**<br>
......!<br>
Got it. I'll stay here with her.

**[Nora]**<br>
*I'll leave her to you. Also, for one last time, thank you.*

**Xenon**<br>
Not at all.

*\[Door Opens\]*

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

**Xenon**<br>
......

**Xenon**<br>
Sorry, this is all my fault.

*\[Lights Off\]*

**Xenon**<br>
!?

**Xenon**<br>
What is happening?<br>
Hey!?

*[Signal Lost]*
