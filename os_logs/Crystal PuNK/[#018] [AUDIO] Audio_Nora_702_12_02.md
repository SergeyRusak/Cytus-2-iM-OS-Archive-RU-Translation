Wahh!!

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Aroma\-chan!

**Hayato**<br>
She's awake!

**[Nora]**<br>
*How is your body feeling? I've experienced this myself before, yet I still forced you through all of it. I'm truly sorry.*

**PAFF**<br>
No... I don't think it had anything to do with using the ability. I saw... something...

**Xenon**<br>
What'd you see?

**Hayato**<br>
Mr. Jackson! She just woke up!

**Xenon**<br>
Ah... Sorry.

**PAFF**<br>
Hayato, I'm fine... Compared to this...

**PAFF**<br>
I saw...a terrifying face, but it disappeared immediately... It wouldn't stop wailing... I couldn't hear what the wailing was about, but it seemed to be calling someone's name non\-stop...?

**Cherry**<br>
Name...?

**PAFF**<br>
I'm not sure either. The voice sounded so pitiful. I wanted to reach out my hand to help it... but then the emotion changed instantly. I felt... like I was going to be killed... It was this strong feeling of hatred...

**PAFF**<br>
*\*Sobs\*...\*Sobs\*...\*Sobs\*...* Ugh...

**Hayato**<br>
Kaori! Are you alright? Enough. Don't think about it anymore. <br>
Please, let her rest.

**Xenon**<br>
......

**PAFF**<br>
I'm sorry. I couldn't be of any help.

**Xenon**<br>
No. You did great. Take a rest for now.

**PAFF**<br>
Mr. Jackson...

**Xenon**<br>
......

**PAFF**<br>
I don't know what was the thing I felt, but whatever it was... it must be stopped as quickly as possible. That murderous intent... it wasn't just aimed towards me. More like... it was aimed towards everybody...

**Xenon**<br>
......<br>
So it was exactly what that guy has guessed...?

**[Nora]**<br>
*……<br>
Miss Kaori Minamiya, if you don't mind, the silent chamber I used as a child should still be operational. Though it is dark and rather cramped inside, it greatly helps with the resting of the mind and body. Please, take a rest inside it.*

**PAFF**<br>
Thank you...

**[Nora]**<br>
*For now, do not use the ability.*

**PAFF**<br>
No…… Please give me a few days to recover. I believe that I must know what was it that I saw. I feel like it is of the utmost importance...!

**[Nora]**<br>
*……<br>
Understood. Daigo, take her to rest.*

**Member D**<br>
Yes. This way, please.

*\[Door Opens\]*

**[Nora]**<br>
*Everyone, if possible, please remain here as guests for now. There are plenty of empty rooms.*

**Hayato**<br>
Of course! I'll always stay by Kaori's side!

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
NEKO will too!

**[Nora]**<br>
*It is currently not ideal for Mr. Jackson and Miss Pauline to be wandering around outside either. This place is ideal for hiding.*

**Cherry**<br>
Thank you, Nora.

**[Nora]**<br>
*Well, then. Please be at ease. You may move about freely in the guest area. If you need anything, just inform the people wearing the uniform.*

*\[Wheelchair Moving\]*

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Cherry**<br>
... She's a good girl. When I first met her, I was a bit scared by her...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Ah! NEKO felt the same way at first too! But Iemme tell you guys, Nora\-chan, she's... uhh, oh yeah! Ropohead's here too. It's quicker if you hear it directly from him!
