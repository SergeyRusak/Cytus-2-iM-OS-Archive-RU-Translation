*\[Alarm\]*

**[Kyuu Hou Kai System]**<br>
*Threat invasion detected in area 03, engaging full fortification in three minutes.  Security personnel, please proceed to your battle stations.*

**Kyuu Hou Kai Member**<br>
Fellow guests, please move in this direction.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Don't push NEKO!<br>
W\-w\-w\-w\-what is going on! Nora\-chan!?

**[Nora]**<br>
*Apologies. The facility is under attack. Before we can resolve this situation, we would like fellow guests to hide here for now.*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
EH!? What attack? Is it dangerous!?

**[Nora]**<br>
*Daigo, the screen.<br>
... It appears that the tunnels in area 03 have already been completely broken through.*

**Member D**<br>
Damnit, how on earth did they find that entrance!? Security team A, team B, report to area 03 immediately!

**Cherry**<br>
Is it Diego...? NEKO, you can relax. Kyuu Hou Kai should be able to deal with those people just fine.

**Xenon**<br>
... The thing Daigo is holding... is that footage from the entrance? Those are the same model of drones that attacked Kyubo Medical Center...

**[Nora]**<br>
*However, the scale this time far surpasses that incident. Looks like they're getting serious too.*

**[Surveillance Camera]**<br>
*This is security team B. The system cannot stop them! Request...*

*\[Machine gun\]*

**[Surveillance Camera]**<br>
*Ugahh...!!*

**Member D**<br>
Miyamoto!? Answer me!<br>
Crap... Chief, we'll have to deploy more people to defend.

**[Nora]**<br>
*This battle will more or less cause everyone some discomfort. Please forgive us. Nonetheless, staying in here will ensure that you won't be in danger.<br>
Daigo, we'll go to the area 03 control room. I'll personally operate the defense system. *

**ROBO_Head**<br>
......

**Hayato**<br>
Nora, shouldn't you stay here as well?

**PAFF**<br>
It's way too dangerous for you to go outside!

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Yeah! Not to mention Nora\-chan can't move around freely. It's better that you stay with us...

**[Nora]**<br>
*The automation of the defense system is just one of its many forms. I am required to use my ability to connect with the system for it to maximize its effectiveness.<br>
You all seem very concerned, but we have plenty of experience dealing with attacks of similar scale. Please rest assured.*

**PAFF**<br>
But, if Nora uses the ability again...

**[Nora]**<br>
*... It's alright.*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Nora, this unit, has firearm installed by Mr. Ichiro. Able to help.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*I won't allow that. You stay here together with them.*

*\[Wheelchair moving\]*

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Cherry**<br>
Hey! Nora!<br>
Damnit, the door is locked...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
... Is it really alright?

**Xenon**<br>
Judging from the footage, their methods are not gonna stop those drones.

**Cherry**<br>
Yeah. They aren't attacking the right parts either.

**Xenon**<br>
...... Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

**Cherry**<br>
... Uh\-huh. The problem now is, how are we gonna open this door?

**PAFF**<br>
Don't tell me, you guys are going... you sure about that?

**Hayato**<br>
Right! We should do what Nora told us and hide here. It's safer that way, isn't it?

**Xenon**<br>
Back off. I'm going to overload the gear in the door lock.

*\[Footsteps\]*

**Xenon**<br>
ROBO...?

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*This room, is Nora and this unit's room. This unit, doesn't want it to suffer any damage.*

**Cherry**<br>
Everyone might be in danger if we don't do something about this!

*\[Enters Password\]*

*\[Door Opens\]*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Password... Nora, didn't change.*

**Xenon**<br>
So you know the password, thanks!<br>
Sherry, let's go.

*\[Parts moving\]*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*This unit, join as well.*

**Cherry**<br>
A gun...?<br>
You sure about this?

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Protect Nora, protect everyone.*

**Cherry**<br>
Gotcha. Then you'll act according to my commands. We help Simon create an opportunity, he'll get rid of those drones, just like how we did it back at the Kyubo Medical Center, correct?

**Xenon**<br>
If we're lucky.<br>
You three, stay here. Hayato, watch the door closely.

*\[Door Closes\]*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Xenon!

*[Signal Lost]*
