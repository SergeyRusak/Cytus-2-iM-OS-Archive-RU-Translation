**[Nora]**<br>
*Please, wait here. Daigo will bring them here.*

**Xenon**<br>
... Them?

**[Nora]**<br>
*There is more than one guest. They insist on moving as a group, so I allowed them all to stay... You two may recognize some of them.*

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Member D**<br>
Please, come...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
AH!?

**Xenon**<br>
Ah...

*\[Runs\]*

*\[Hugs\]*

**Xenon**<br>
Hey... let go of me.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
NEKO was sooo worried about you……eh!? Sis Cherry's here too!? Whahaha……

**Xenon**<br>
If you're here, that means...

**Cherry**<br>
PAFF!?

**PAFF**<br>
Miss Cherry, it's been a while...

**Hayato**<br>
You girls sure know a lot of people...

**Xenon**<br>
Nora, what's going on? Weren't you taking us to see the one with the ability?

**[Nora]**<br>
*Yes. Miss Kaori Minamiya is the one with the ability.*

**Xenon、Cherry**<br>
......!?<br>
Kaori Minamiya...?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Eh? Eh? What is going on!?

**[Nora]**<br>
*... I'll start explaining from the parts I know.*

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

**[Nora]**<br>
*And that is more or less what happened. Therefore, it is confirmed that Miss Kaori Minamiya's brain contains both hers and Miss Aroma White's memory right now. At the same time, the body of Kaori Minamiya also possesses natural traits of "The Eye of Horus" ability, to begin with.*

**Xenon**<br>
PAFF is the ability user...

**PAFF**<br>
H\-hello.

**Xenon**<br>
Umm... H\-hello.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Shocked! Xenon is embarrassed! This is a Tier SSR scene! Need to take a picture ASAP!

**Xenon**<br>
I beg you, please be quiet for a minute...<br>
So... there's more than one ability user. As long as some sort of natural condition is fulfilled, other ability users may also exist?

**[Nora]**<br>
*That's right. Occasionally, I will come in contact with other consciousnesses in the OS, like damaged A.I. or some unidentifiable breathing. But as of now, the only ones I know of are her and myself.*

**Xenon**<br>
Then... Even though it's our first time meeting, can you try to use your ability on the keywords we provided? First, A.R.C's Library.

**PAFF**<br>
I... I'll give it a try!

**[Nora]**<br>
*Miss Kaori Minamiya, don't be nervous. Like I said before, it's like connecting to the virtual internet. Relax your whole body and concentrate all of your consciousness on the nodes of those signals.*

**PAFF**<br>
......

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
... Has it begun?

**[Nora]**<br>
*Please, be quiet.*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
......

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

**PAFF**<br>
......

**PAFF**<br>
... I...

**[Nora]**<br>
*Do you see anything?*

**PAFF**<br>
I feel I've... already arrived at the place you described, but...

**Xenon**<br>
......?

**PAFF**<br>
Strange... it's so dark. I can't see anything...

**[Nora]**<br>
*……<br>
Of the places you can go to, there shouldn't be any empty areas...*

**PAFF**<br>
Ugh...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Aroma\-chan!? She's bleeding out of her nose again! Stop!!

**PAFF**<br>
Ughhhh…… WAAAAHHHHH!!!NOOO!!!NOO!!

*\[Collapse\]*

**Hayato**<br>
KAORI!

*[Signal Lost]*
