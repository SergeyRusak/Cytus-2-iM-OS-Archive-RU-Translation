**Bureau Supervisor**<br>
Luis... we are all very sorry for Carly's accident. The Administration Bureau will take full responsibility for this error. We'll ensure that you get all the subsidies available. If there's anything else we can help...

**Luis**<br>
I'm resigning.

**Bureau Supervisor**<br>
Luis...?

**Luis**<br>
The transportation center is where I met her. I can no longer work here anymore. In addition, please don't give us any subsidies from the Bureau... This is my resignation form. Thank you for your care all these years.

**Bureau Supervisor**<br>
Luis, you really don't have to do this...

**Luis**<br>
Sherry, we're leaving.

**Bureau Supervisor**<br>
Luis!

**Cherry**<br>
Daddy... is mommy not coming back?

**Luis**<br>
Mommy... *\*sobs\*...*

**Cherry**<br>
...... Daddy?

**Luis**<br>
Yes. Mommy... is gone to become a star singer.

**Angus**<br>
Capo... Is it really okay for us to be doing this kind of transaction? If Ando or Cafe's geezer caught wind of this...

**Diego**<br>
Don't be silly. No one will know. We have a very powerful helper this time... Speaking of which, why hasn't he showed up yet?

**Angus**<br>
You mean that "Mediator" you mentioned before?

**Diego**<br>
Yes. He's an engineer who used to work at the transportation center. Regarding the paths and patroling route of the drones here, he knows them like the back of his hand. For smuggling deals, he's the best help we can get.

**Angus**<br>
Someone from the admins... Is he trustworthy?

**Diego**<br>
No worries. His wife was accidentally killed by the admins' Enforcer Drone two years ago. He refused the subsidies from the admins and proceeded to hit rock bottom. He became addicted to alcohol and gambling. He was just like us, mere trash who dwelled in the sewers of society. He was later discovered by our casino members, who then gave him a chance to be human again.

**Angus**<br>
......

**Diego**<br>
Do you understand? Without these opportunities, loathed trash like this will be everywhere on the streets. That bulls\*\*\* gray balance Ando and Cafe insist on maintaining right now will only create more trash for this society.

**Angus**<br>
And those civilians who enjoy their pitiful fortunes and the upper class who enjoy their power and money will pretend to not see them as well.

**Diego**<br>
That's right. Angus, listen up. It doesn't matter if it takes ten years, or even twenty years. We must climb to the top and destroy the gray balance and Cafe's system. Only by doing that will we ever have the opportunity to bring about change.

**Diego**<br>
And that's the content of this transaction. Do you understand?

**Member**<br>
Yes, Capo!

**Diego**<br>
Luis, what route do you suggest we take this time?

**Luis**<br>
Won't be as easy this time... the admins have already locked on to almost every single route we've used in the past. Judging by this amount, I might have to open up a new route.

**Diego**<br>
Any good ideas?

**Luis**<br>
No.13... Rumor has it that after The Decommission, due to a severe flooding problem with the facilities here, the entrance got stuck and can't be opened. The admins haven't bothered to deal with it to this day. If we can somehow remove the water...

**Diego**<br>
What is this place?

**Luis**<br>
Before the Decommission, it seemed to be a pathway for the Architects to exit the forbidden areas. It also connects to other Nodes. I think... it shouldn't be hard to open up this entrance. The bigger issue is the area this connects to. It's a facility that's still operating automatically. It has armed drone models too. Our manpower might not be able to handle them...

**Diego**<br>
If you need weapons, we have more than enough.

**Luis**<br>
That's not the problem. The scanning device for this model...

**Diego**<br>
What's the matter?

**Luis**<br>
No... nothing. Forget about this route then. There should be other methods.

**Diego**<br>
Why the sudden change of topic? You're hiding something?

**Luis**<br>
No.

**Diego**<br>
It's the scanner in this picture, isn't it? This type of scanner won't trigger an armed response alarm when it detects a civilian ID of someone 16 years old or younger. Is that what you want to say?

**Luis**<br>
......!

**Diego**<br>
You're not the only advisor we have. We don't have any member who's under the age of 16 though. How troublesome.

**Luis**<br>
... What are you trying to say?

**Diego**<br>
Your daughter, if I recall correctly, her P.E. scores are pretty good, right?

**Luis**<br>
Diego! I don't belong to your organization, nor am I your dog! I will not allow you to get my daughter involved in this stuff!

**Diego**<br>
What's wrong? Could it be that you didn't tell her? The reason why you pulled yourself together; the reason why you two could return to a happy, normal life; it's not because you got some proper job. It's by doing dirty jobs like this. It's all because of us.

**Luis**<br>
... Ugh!

**Diego**<br>
This has nothing to do with where you belong. It's about the most basic concept of personal conduct. We pulled you out of the trash heap and gave you and your daughter the security to continue to live normally in society. For these years, I believe I didn't mistreat you no matter how you look at it. Is this attitude how you repay us?

**Luis**<br>
In short, I absolutely will not let her participate.

**Diego**<br>
Think about it yourself. Even if we exclude this case, I feel like the fact that you let your daughter constantly live in such an illusion makes it even more pathetic. How long do you plan to hide this from her? If you end up dying underground someday, it'll be a group of strangers from the gang that has to visit your home and inform her of your death. Do you think that's better?

**Luis**<br>
......
