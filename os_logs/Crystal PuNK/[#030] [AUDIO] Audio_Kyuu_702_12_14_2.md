**Xenon**<br>
Huff... Puff... Last one left...

**Cherry**<br>
Very good! Hey, you okay?

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Xenon, stamina depleted. Require water intake.*

**Cherry**<br>
Are you serious? We just barely ran a few meters!

**Xenon**<br>
Shut up......<br>
...... Watch out!!

*\[Push away\]*

*\[Explosion\]*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Wall, destroyed. Cause: Pulse bomb used by drones.*

**Cherry**<br>
Simon!? Simon! Where are you!?

**Xenon**<br>
*\*Cough cough\**...! I'm fine!<br>
... My device is missing! Where is it!?

**Cherry**<br>
I have it! Can you come out here?

**Xenon**<br>
*\*Cough\**... I can't. The wall is blocking the way.<br>
It is likely just attacking at random. It doesn't seem that it has discovered us. Gotta destroy it before that... Robohead, can you destroy the wall?

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Report: Magazine empty. Physical attack of this unit, unable to fulfill request.*

*\[Drones Flying\]*

**Cherry**<br>
... No other way around it then.

*\[Device connection\]*

**Xenon**<br>
... Sherry? What are you doing?

**Cherry**<br>
I've connected your A.I. to my virtual internet chip. Tell me how to operate this thing!

**Xenon**<br>
......!? No! Your chip hasn't been configured for it. It may hurt your...

**Cherry**<br>
Shut your damn mouth and just tell me! We don't have time!

**Xenon**<br>
... Fine. Listen closely. Once my A.I. locks on to the weak point, press the red button on the interface. This will bring up a list of adjustable parameters for the drone. Crank the core operating speed up to max.<br>
However... we need to knock away its armor for my A.I. to lock on... ROBO, you're out of bullets, right?

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Affirmative.*

**Xenon**<br>
Sherry, what about you?

**Cherry**<br>
Ugh... this interface is so complicated! I can't operate this thing and shoot at the same time!

*\[Drones Flying\]*

**Xenon**<br>
It's getting closer and closer...

**[Nora]**<br>
*I'll... do the attack.*

**Xenon**<br>
Nora!? Where are you?

**[Nora]**<br>
*In the control room... the defense system... failed just now. But... I've addressed the issue already.<br>
I'm going to pull the trigger... please be prepared.*

*\[Gunshot\]*

**Xenon**<br>
NOW!

**Cherry**<br>
Wah! Wait...

*\[Machine Gun\]*

**Xenon**<br>
Sherry!?

*\[Hacking\]*

**[Nora]**<br>
*... We did it?*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Report: All drones destroyed.<br>
Miss Cherry hit, bullet wound. Collapsed and currently unconscious.*

**Xenon**<br>
!!<br>
Is she alright!?

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Scanning... Life signs stable.*

**Xenon**<br>
... Whew...

**[Nora]**<br>
*ROBO... take her to the medical room in the central area.<br>
Mr. Simon Jackson, one moment, please... We'll help free you from the rubble.*

**Xenon**<br>
Sherry...

**[Nora]**<br>
*Please rest assured. We will rescue her with all the resources at our disposal. In the entirety of Node 03, this is the place with the most advanced medical technology.*

*[Signal Lost]*
