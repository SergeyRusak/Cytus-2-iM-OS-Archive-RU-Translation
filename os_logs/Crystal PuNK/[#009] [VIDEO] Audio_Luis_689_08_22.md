**Luis**<br>
Sherry, I'm home.

**Cherry**<br>
Another late shift today, is it? Thanks for the hard work.<br>
Here, coffee.

**Luis**<br>
Thank you... You're not sleeping yet?

**Cherry**<br>
I still want to practice the guitar a bit more. Hehe.

**Luis**<br>
I see.

**Cherry**<br>
You look very exhausted. Are things at work not going well?

**Luis**<br>
......

**Cherry**<br>
I've filed the application to the Academy. I can start working part\-time next year. This way, father won't have to work so hard anymore.

**Luis**<br>
Sherry...

**Cherry**<br>
Let's work hard together. Get some rest.

**Luis**<br>
Sherry, daddy... has something to tell you.

**Cherry**<br>
......?

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

**Cherry**<br>
......<br>
I see... so our lives for the past few years have all been supported by something like this...

**Luis**<br>
I'm sorry. I thought about it for a long time, and I came to the decision to tell you everything. You're a very precocious child, especially after your mother passed away. You've always been very strong, staying by my side to face all of this hardship. During the time when I was a sloppy mess, if not for you... I'm certain that I would've given up a long time ago.

**Cherry**<br>
To be honest, I already knew that something was odd because whenever we talked about father's job, you were always beating around the bush... When you told me that you've pulled yourself together, was that all a lie too...?

**Luis**<br>
I'm sorry...

**Cherry**<br>
...... No. I am very happy that father is willing to tell me all this. You aren't treating me like a child. You understand that I don't like to be treated that way.

**Luis**<br>
Sherry...

**Cherry**<br>
The case this time, if I don't help, things will get really troublesome, right?

**Luis**<br>
In all honesty... I don't know. That Diego guy, on the surface it looks like he's helping us. He also has his own set of principles. However, I really can't figure out what he's thinking.

**Luis**<br>
However, I've made up my mind. This can't keep going on. I have to find an opportunity to end our relationship with them... As long as we can get this transaction done...

**Cherry**<br>
Let me go then.

**Luis**<br>
......!? NO! Absolutely not!

**Cherry**<br>
I... I'm not as strong as father thinks. I don't really have anyone I can talk to in the Academy, and I've always felt that life is rather empty. When I am by father's side, only then can I feel that I must work hard and not lose to you. 

**Luis**<br>
......

**Cherry**<br>
I want to see the world father described, the world I've never seen before. I... I want to help father out.

Good job, Luis.

**Diego**<br>
Hey... That's enough, isn't it? It's already broken.

**Angus**<br>
That guy has lost his mind again.

**Diego**<br>
Whatever. Let him vent his anger.

**Cherry**<br>
... Father...

**Diego**<br>
Little girl, are you hurt? You did great. Good job.

**Cherry**<br>
......
