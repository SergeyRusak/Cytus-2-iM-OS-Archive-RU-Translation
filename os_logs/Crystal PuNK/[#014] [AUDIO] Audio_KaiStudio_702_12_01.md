*\[Ringtone\]*

*[Call starts]*

**[Rald]**<br>
*It's me, Miss Pauline. How are you two doing in 03 these days? Haven't caused any major commotions, I presume?*

**Cherry**<br>
Ummm...... no.

**[Rald]**<br>
*Haha, spare me your terrible acting. "Kyubo Medical Center attacked by unknown organization with hacked armed drones, anonymous heroes successfully deterred attack..."<br>
... This is talking about you guys, isn't it? Even though Node 13 doesn't have a connection to cyTus, a news story this major is bound to make its way here.*

**Cherry**<br>
... We weren't recognized. Simon rushed inside as soon as he saw the attack unfold. I couldn't do anything about it.

**[Rald]**<br>
*Can totally imagine that... Whatever. I'm a bit busy right now, so I'll just skip directly to the key points.<br>
You okay with that? Do you need to grab a pen to take some notes?*

**Cherry**<br>
... What, am I a three\-year\-old child to you?

**[Rald]**<br>
*Very well, then listen closely.<br>
My investigations in Node 13 are more or less complete. It's time you guys take action on your side. Miss Pauline, I believe you should know a few things about the gangs in 03 since you've been a Mediator for quite some time?*

**Cherry**<br>
Maybe.

**[Rald]**<br>
*Does the name "Kyuu Hou Kai" ring any bells?*

**Cherry**<br>
Yes. That name is very well\-known in the Baro Brotherhood. It's currently their main firearms supplier. However, that's pretty much all I know. They never let me know too much regarding the details of their deals.

**[Rald]**<br>
*Knowing that is more than enough.<br>
According to the information I obtained, "The Eye of Horus" I previously mentioned to Mr. Jackson appears to be under their control.*

**Cherry**<br>
......!<br>
In other words, we'll have to negotiate with Kyuu Hou Kai...?

**[Rald]**<br>
*Doesn't have to be that complicated.<br>
The gang has used "The Eye of Horus" ability to gain profit for itself. Thus, I went through their "transaction" records in the past and was able to reverse track it back to the "entrance". I then proceeded to directly transfer some money to them... a sum so big that's going to catch even the gangs by surprise. *

**Cherry**<br>
So that person sees anyone as long as they have the money?

**[Rald]**<br>
*Not quite. There are still some procedures that needs to be done. This is where you two come in. As the next step, you fellas will go to a location I will specify on a specific date. Then, you'll say the keyword and show the certificate to the shop clerk there. That clerk will then take you to meet that person.*

**Cherry**<br>
... That sounds really suspicious no matter how you look at it.

**[Rald]**<br>
*My oh my, we're this deep into this whole ordeal and you still don't trust me? During that week we survived together, our coordination was like a perfect harmony. You are the graceful violin while Mr. Jackson is the steady cello.*

**Cherry**<br>
Ho? Then what about you?

**[Rald]**<br>
*The composer and conductor, of course. \*Chuckles\**

**Cherry**<br>
... Simon wasn't wrong at all when he described you as "self\-centered". Don't you dare treat us like instruments you can willfully play with. 

**[Rald]**<br>
*Instruments that produce awful noises are not worthy to be listened to. On the other hand, the sounds you two produced are quite beautiful. I thoroughly enjoyed conducting you two.*

**Cherry**<br>
Does this count as you complimenting us in a roundabout way?

**[Rald]**<br>
*Haha.<br>
As long as we can use "The Eye of Horus" ability and pair that with Mr. Jackson's skills, we'll be able to discover a part... no, perhaps a much bigger part of the truth than we thought. But... *

**Cherry**<br>
But?

**[Rald]**<br>
*The last "transaction" record was several years ago. I have no way of knowing what happened that resulted in the lack of transactions in recent years. You two will have to improvise on the fly... \*Chuckles\*, with you around, you won't be at a disadvantage if a gunfight is involved. That much is for sure.*

**Cherry**<br>
You're flattering me, aren't you? When we were hunting on the surface, your accuracy is pretty on par with mine.

**[Rald]**<br>
*Humility is one of the Neumann family's many virtues.<br>
I need to stay in 13 for a while longer. I'll leave the negotiation with Kyuu Hou Kai to you two. I'll send the address and certificate to Mr. Jackson later. Have him encrypt them a little too, just to make sure that no one can get any important info from them.*

**Cherry**<br>
What else do you need to investigate there?

**[Rald]**<br>
*Simply put, it's some "manuscripts" left behind by my family's ancestors. However, those people don't seem to be your average joe either. They spent quite the effort concealing these documents. Perhaps they are so confident in their abilities that they figured only their own descendants will be capable of finding them? Ooh, now that's getting me a bit excited.*

**Cherry**<br>
... Do they have something to do with the Ã†sir incident?

**[Rald]**<br>
*Still to be determined... or more like I hope my hypothesis is correct because this is the one path closest to the truth. Be it for you guys, for me, or for humanity as a whole.<br>
Apologies, Miss Pauline, but I have to go now.*

*[Call Ends]*

**Cherry**<br>
