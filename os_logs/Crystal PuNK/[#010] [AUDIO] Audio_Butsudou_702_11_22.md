**Ryu**<br>
Looks like everyone is here. It's been a long time, Diego.

**Diego**<br>
Indeed. Thank you all for coming despite your undoubtedly very busy schedules.

**Nora**<br>
......

**Ryu**<br>
No need to be so polite. The Baro Brotherhood's performance in 08 is seen by all of us. You're not only an important customer but also our good brother. Since you encounter trouble, there's no reason why we shouldn't face it together.

**Diego**<br>
Brother, is it... how nostalgic. Manson and I used to refer to each other as brothers as well. His passing still saddens me to this very day. He was a hero...

**[Nora]**<br>
*... Can we get to the point already?*

**Diego**<br>
Still as cold as ever, aren't you? The Eye of Horus... You're right though. Let's begin.<br>
Last time, we purchased a shipment of weapons from Kyuu Hou Kai. However, during the transport carried out by Mogura, an issue occurred. From what I've learned, the Splice people you hired were all knocked unconscious. As with the weapons, they were destroyed and discarded in the underground tunnels. 

**[Nora]**<br>
*As compensation, we've fully refunded your organization the back payment as well as the liquidated damage payment. If you still want to do the transaction, you can place the next order any time you want. With all that we've done, I don't see where you can be dissatisfied?*

**Ryu**<br>
... Regarding the transport accident, we've labeled it as an important issue and are currently investigating...

**Diego**<br>
Apologies for my bluntness, however, brother Ryu's so\-called "investigation" is merely asking the admins to visit the tunnels a few times, make some marks here and there, and come up with a final report that essentially just says "Nothing abnormal has been found." Right? 

**Ryu**<br>
Diego, this amount of money is nothing to Mogura. We can compensate you whenever...

**Diego**<br>
What I care about is not the compensation, but the existence of a "disturbance". It's an obstacle between the coexistence and mutual prosperity of the Baro Brotherhood and Mogura. This disturbance is like a tiny thorn in the muscle. Although it doesn't hurt, if you ignore and don't treat it, it'll cause your entire leg to rot and decay, forcing you to amputate it. 

**Ryu**<br>
I see. You want us to give you a proper answer.

**Diego**<br>
Certainly. What I'm seeking is the "truth".<br>
For example... the whereabouts of the "culprits".

*\[Projection\]*

**Diego**<br>
According to the info we got, there are three culprits. This is the photo of the male who showed his face first. The remaining two carried out the ambush by destroying the lighting in the underground facility. The identities of these two are unknown. Judging by the voices, it's one male and one female.

**Ryu**<br>
Gravediggers are everywhere and every one of them is affiliated with a different organization. This tiny bit of information is nowhere near enough to investigate...

**Nora**<br>
......

**Diego**<br>
No. If it's a planned robbery by other organizations, the weapons should all be gone. However, after going through the discarded pile, the only weapon missing is a single P\-440. What kind of people would want to destroy the cargo? Definitely someone who doesn't want the transaction itself to be carried out.

**Ryu**<br>
... What are you trying to say?

**Diego**<br>
I'll be frank. After Manson died, Mogura has always been at a disadvantage when it comes to combat power. Even the Baro Brotherhood is on the verge of surpassing Mogura. The organization's current status is entirely supported by the massive economic chain you people created.

**Diego**<br>
As with Kyuu Hou Kai, after Nora took over, you've been constantly avoiding events that can strengthen the organization or ones that may cause bloodshed. From where I stand, it wouldn't surprise me if either of you is behind this accident.

**Ryu**<br>
Young man, be careful what you say. Trouble tends to find people like you.

**Diego**<br>
Oh, I wouldn't dare. The one man who oversees all of Mogura, the deeply respected Ryu Minatsuki, I believe you're just as much of a hero as Manson.

**[Nora]**<br>
*... "Carried out the ambush by destroying the lighting in the underground facility", those are your exact words, correct?*

**Diego**<br>
Certainly. Is something wrong with that?

**[Nora]**<br>
*The underground facility uses ancient civilization technology of the Architects. There aren't a lot of people capable of controlling or hacking this technology... or I should say, as far as I know, there are only a couple. If you add that to the action of "destroying the transaction itself"... I think that at least one of the three culprits is from Node 08. If that's the case, then I believe the responsibility belongs to you, an 08 organization. *

**Diego**<br>
Hoho? You seem to be pretty good at guessing, but what is your evidence? Or, are you going to provide evidence right here with your eyes...

**[Nora]**<br>
*I refuse. There's no reason for me to risk my life using my eyes, especially when it's for something as pointless and as unrelated to myself as this one.<br>
Kyuu Hou Kai provides the goods. Accidents that occur during the shipping process is an issue that you guys should deal with yourself.*

**Ryu**<br>
Nora... Mogura, Kyuu Hou Kai and the Baro Brotherhood own at least 70% of the underground societies of 03 and 08. Our alliance has the utmost importance...

**[Nora]**<br>
*I said before, I am not interested in 70% of the businesses you currently have. These three people you're looking for, weapon transactions, and this self\-proclaimed "alliance" of yours are all included in that 70%. *

**Ryu**<br>
......

**[Nora]**<br>
*I've already stated Kyuu Hou Kai's position very clearly. There's no need for me to participate in this discussion anymore.<br>
Daigo, start the car. Let's go.*

*\[Car door opens\]*

**Diego**<br>
Looks like the negotiations have failed, brother Ryu. Haven't seen her in a while and that little girl has become more troublesome than ever.

**Ryu**<br>
Hmph... if we want to talk about troublesome fellas, you're right up there as well. You got guts to name me as a suspect.

**Diego**<br>
Haha, you understand that's just nonsense spoken for her, right? Shall we get into our actual main topic?

**Ryu**<br>
Yes... to Mogura, Kyuu Hou Kai has already grown to a place where it's beginning to threaten our position. A phoenix rebirthed from the ashes soaring over the massive dragon of the earth... Can't help but be quite concerned.

**Diego**<br>
No doubt about it. I see that we still have a mutual understanding of the situation. This is exactly what I want to discuss with you. As long as the alliance between us two major factions exist...

**Ryu**<br>
Got any good ideas?

*[â†’Switch to tapping signal]*

**[Diego]**<br>
*Based on my experience, snuffing out the sparks in time before the fire spreads out is the only way to control and utilize flames.*

**[Ryu]**<br>
*From the sound of it, you seem to be very certain that you can achieve your goal?*

**[Diego]**<br>
*Of course. We're brothers after all. The little brother ought to help the older brother solve his problems.<br>
I already have a perfect plan in place. First, we'll start with the Kyubo Medical Center that's irrelevant to us. All that's required is for you to nod your head...*

**Member D**<br>
