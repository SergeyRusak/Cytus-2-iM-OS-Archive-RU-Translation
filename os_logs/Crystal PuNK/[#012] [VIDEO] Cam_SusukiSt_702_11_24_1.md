**Pedestrian A**<br>
What is going on? Is it a terrorist attack!?

**Pedestrian B**<br>
Waaahhhh!! They're... the hospital...

**Xenon**<br>
Hey, it's dangerous...

**Cherry**<br>
Wait, don't go near them! Even drones that are out of control will still automatically attack anything that comes into their detection range!

**Xenon**<br>
... Out of control, is it? Take a look at their positions and where they are stopping.

**Cherry**<br>
Facing the hospital, deployed in two rows; the ones on the outside have entered security mode while two drones occupy the high ground... This is...

**Xenon**<br>
Yes. They aren't just firing at random. Be it their formation or their attack rhythm, they are all strategically planned. Someone is definitely controlling them remotely behind the scenes.

**Cherry**<br>
... The gangs, is it? This is 03 after all...

**Xenon**<br>
Highly possible. Kyubo Medical Center... I think I've seen this name in the gang organizations' data... Regardless, no matter what it's associated with, this is still a hospital...

*\[Drones flying\]*

**Cherry**<br>
A few of them are going inside!?

**Xenon**<br>
Are you kidding... no matter what they want to do, we must prevent them from attacking regular civilians.

**Cherry**<br>
Hold it right there. Did you see their outer shells? They're made out of the newest type of metal alloys. Our guns are not gonna penetrate that.

**Xenon**<br>
Then the only option is to hack into their system... can't do that from here. I'll have to get closer to find a gap between their movement patterns to break inside...

**Cherry**<br>
NO! Have you gone mad? These drones are equipped with assault rocket launchers. They are models used in wars. With how physically unfit you are, getting closer to them is basically a death wish!

**Xenon**<br>
But we have to help the civilians!

**Cherry**<br>
Of course we're helping! What I meant to say is, you'll stay behind me while I create the opportunity for you. However, if we just rush inside like this, we'll absolutely get caught on camera... I have a mask. What about you?

*\[Helmet activates\]*

**Cherry**<br>
... New helmet? Pretty cool\-looking...

**Xenon**<br>
Not the time for such comments, don't you think? Let's move!

*\[Explosion\]*

**Child C**<br>
*\*Cries\**... Daddy...<br>
Daddy where are you...

*\[Gunshot\]*

**Cherry**<br>
Look out!

**Child C**<br>
Waah!

*\[Consecutive Gunshots\]*

**Cherry**<br>
Simon! Now!

*\[Hacking\]*

**Xenon**<br>
So even children this small aren't spared... No matter who's behind this, they've gone too far.

*[→Signal Switches]*

*\[Explosion\]*

**Xenon**<br>
It's coming from upstairs... gotta move fast.

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

**Xenon**<br>
... There's a lot of them. Sherry, cover me. I'm going to finish them all off in one go. Since they're the same model, their encryption should be the same set as well.

**[Drone]**<br>
*Threat detected. Initiate termination process.*

**Cherry**<br>
Hey, tin cans! Look over here!

*\[Gunshot\]*

**[Drone]**<br>
*Incoming firearm attack, damage suffered... low.<br>
Adjusting termination priority. New target acquired*

**[Xenon A.I.]**<br>
*Remote control authorization decrypting... 57%.*

**Cherry**<br>
Yes, that's right. Come this way... Wah!

*\[Explosion\]*

**Xenon**<br>
Sherry? Sherry!? Are you alright?

**Cherry**<br>
Cough... cough... Don't worry about me!

**Xenon**<br>
Damnit... Come on, hurry up!

*\[Hacking\]*

**[Drone]**<br>
*Command accepted. Adjusting termination priority. New target acquired. <br>
Execute attack immediately.*

**Cherry**<br>
What's going on... What new target?

**Xenon**<br>
Hide! NOW!

**Cherry**<br>
!?!?!?
