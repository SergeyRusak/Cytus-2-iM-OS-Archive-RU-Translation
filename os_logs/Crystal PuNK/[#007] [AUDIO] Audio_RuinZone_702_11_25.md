*\[Machine Gun\]*

**Cherry**<br>
Any questions? This is more or less how it feels. Look, all within the center circle. Understood?

**Xenon**<br>
... Nope, not at all. By the way, don't people generally begin their practice with handguns? What's all this about? Showing off?

**Cherry**<br>
Haha, yep. Here, this one's for you.

**Xenon**<br>
Don't point the barrel at people...

**Cherry**<br>
Rest assured. These are all rubber bullets. Their trajectory will be a little lower than real bullets. Raise your hands... That's right, just like this.

**Xenon**<br>
... Does this count as you trying to molest me?

**Cherry**<br>
Why would I want to molest a skinny boy like you? Now pull the trigger.

*\[Gunshot\]*

**Cherry**<br>
... Huh, turns out you're quite talented at this!

**Xenon**<br>
It feels pretty much the same as the games we used to play.

**Cherry**<br>
Ah! So you were going easy on me back then after all? Interesting, let's have a match!

**Xenon**<br>
A match of what...? You want to start a gunfight here?

**Cherry**<br>
A target practice match, you dumba\*\*! Getting hit by these bullets still hurts like hell, you know?

*\[Gunshot\]*

**Xenon**<br>
Speaking of which... you really used that guy's money to buy all this stuff.

**Cherry**<br>
He told us to use it, so why not. Besides, he has a good point. You really need to learn how to protect yourself. Or else you'd be a complete liability when we're in action.

**Xenon**<br>
Don't forget who's the one that saved you back in the underground tunnels.

**Cherry**<br>
If I have to rely on your slow as f\*\*\* GAMEBAI, I can have infinite lives and it still won't be enough.

*\[Gunshot\]*

**Xenon**<br>
Judging from the number of bullseyes, my accuracy is a lot better than yours, isn't it? There's no point in practicing at all.

**Cherry**<br>
Idiot. Fire the shots consecutively. Empty this magazine.

*\[Consecutive Gunshots\]*

**Xenon**<br>
......?<br>
... The last few shots didn't even hit the target...

**Cherry**<br>
A real gun's recoil, weight, and the delay between each shot are all nowhere near as stable as they are in games. How do you feel? Your arms are starting to feel sore, right? What you just used is the smallest gun we have here too.

**Xenon**<br>
......

**Cherry**<br>
Did you forget what you told me when you were teaching me how to play the guitar? The "Empty Glass Mentality", never be boastful just because you have a little experience or talent.

**Xenon**<br>
... I just made that stuff up on the fly. However, your guitar skills did indeed improve greatly afterward. Guess I can't complain then.

**Cherry**<br>
Good. Now let's continue.

*\[Consecutive Gunshots\]*

**Xenon**<br>
Whew... This is a lot more exhausting than I thought.

**Cherry**<br>
Your stamina is way too low.<br>
Keep both feet as wide as your shoulders. Keep your back straight and don't hunch. Make sure your shoulders, elbows, and fingertips are on the same straight line. The moment you pull the trigger, relax your body as much as possible. This puts less stress on your body, thus it is less tiring.

*\[Gunshot\]*

**Xenon**<br>
It really is...

**Cherry**<br>
Hmph, I'm not a bad teacher, right?

**Xenon**<br>
Did Luis teach you all this?

**Cherry**<br>
......

*\[Consecutive Gunshots\]*

**Xenon**<br>
When I was little, because of some stupid reasons, I stole my father's gun. He gave me a serious beating after he found out.

*\[Consecutive Gunshots\]*

**Xenon**<br>
In all honesty, when we were stealing it, both Shannon and I were utterly terrified. We didn't even dare to disengage the safety. You were trained from a very young age by Luis, right? The first time you ever held a gun, did you feel as calm as you are now?

**Cherry**<br>
... Yeah. I don't think I was scared at all back then. All I thought about was that I'm helping out my father. Besides, the things we shot at were all machines too. He never assaulted a person...

**Xenon**<br>
... Except my father.

**Cherry**<br>
Simon...

*\[Consecutive Gunshots\]*

**Xenon**<br>
Only after actually holding one in my hands did I realize how heavy this thing is.<br>
The force of the bullet being fired... felt so real.

**Xenon**<br>
If I were in Luis's position, what would I do? If it was to protect you... I would probably pull the trigger as well.

**Cherry**<br>
......

**Xenon**<br>
However, how would it feel like then, when you realized that you've just killed a person?

*\[Consecutive Gunshots\]*

**Xenon**<br>
... Must've felt like s\*\*\*.

**Cherry**<br>
... Yeah.

**Xenon**<br>
When you're firing a gun... you look as if you're on stage. Strong\-willed, filled with confidence, and sometimes a little happy.

**Cherry**<br>
... I won't lie to you anymore. Indeed, to me, this is another thing that allows me to acknowledge who I am...

**Cherry**<br>
After we broke up, I once tried to throw all my guns into the river. Yet in the end, I still couldn't let them go... That's the only place where I feel more alive than when I'm on stage. I never even once considered the consequences of those actions either... or should I say I pretended to not know for my own sake. I'm horrible, aren't I...?

**Xenon**<br>
If, like your music, you can use this ability to help more people, perhaps it's not that horrible... What you need to let go of is not guns... but the past.

*\[Consecutive Gunshots\]*

**Cherry**<br>
......!

**Xenon**<br>
See, all within the center circle. This counts as a passing grade, right?
