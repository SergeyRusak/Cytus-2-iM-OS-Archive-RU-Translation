**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Sensei, he's in the inner room.

**??????**<br>
Hehe, don't call me Sensei. I haven't seen you in so long. Seems like you've grown taller?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Muuu~ don't treat me like a child.

**??????**<br>
...*\*chuckles\* ...\*sigh\**... Hiding in such a filthy place like this, no wonder folks couldn't find you. Even a cockroach wouldn't want to enter a place like this.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Ahaha… NEKO was able to find him on the streets only because Aroma\-chan helped out. Then I asked brother Kai to...

**??????**<br>
I'm aware. I've already heard about the details from Miss Nora.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Umm... so what are you gonna do next? No matter how much you knock, he doesn't seem to respond at all...

**??????**<br>
I came here to confirm a few things, then I'll leave immediately. First, let's make sure that he's not dead in there, shall we?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Eh, probably not...He ate everything NEKO brought him. Then he put the utensils in front of the door like this. It's like he's a total recluse...

*\[Door Knock\]*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Xenon, someone's here to see you…

**??????**<br>
Hey, would you please open the door? You know who I am, don't you?

**Xenon**<br>
……

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
...Looks like he still hasn't recovered…

*\[Kicks Door\]*

**Xenon**<br>
!?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
EHHH!?

**ConneR**<br>
Good afternoon. It has been a while.

**Xenon**<br>
……

**ConneR**<br>
Is it just me, or is this déjà vu? You in dire straits looking like crap, and then I bust in like a valiant hero.

**Xenon**<br>
...What do you want?

**ConneR**<br>
Didn't you hear? I'm here to confirm a few things. Little kitten, can you give us some alone time?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Eh? Ah, okay… NEKO will go wash the dishes.

**ConneR**<br>
There's...quite a lot of instruments here. An old storage room for an instrument shop? Fits your current situation quite well, don't you think?

**Xenon**<br>
……

**ConneR**<br>
Okay, enough with the chit\-chat. We've already got our hands on some clues regarding the enemy and some important information. Thus, Miss Nora and I think it's time we head to the epicenter of this entire incident——Node 08.

**Xenon**<br>
……?

**ConneR**<br>
Oh? You haven't heard about it? I've already touched base with them and the two sides have exchanged all the information we've obtained. You've been away from the team for quite some time now, so if you're still interested, I can catch you up to speed in no time.

**Xenon**<br>
……

**ConneR**<br>
Figure as much. The pain one feels from losing a loved one, it's not like I haven't had similar experiences either. How about we set such serious matters aside for now? You think you'd feel better?

**Xenon**<br>
I think I'd feel much better if you got the hell out of here right now.

**ConneR**<br>
Haha, very funny. Don't forget, if it wasn't for the fact that you could offer us major assistance in this operation, there's no way I'd be willing to come to this dump.

**Xenon**<br>
……

**ConneR**<br>
Don't be like this. Relax. <br>
...*\*sigh\**... What a hassle. You don't know how to pull yourself out of this, do you? Catch.

**Xenon**<br>
Wah!?

**ConneR**<br>
That's quite a nice guitar, eh? Play a song with me, will you?

**Xenon**<br>
... Huh? I am not in the mood right now…

*\[Music\]*

**Xenon**<br>
……!

**ConneR**<br>
Recognize this song? I really like it. The last song included on Crystal PuNK's album.

**Xenon**<br>
... Stop playing…

**ConneR**<br>
You've spent the majority of your life trying to save the people around you, yet you have no idea how to save yourself. Is there anything more pathetic than that? Pick up that guitar, the prelude's about to end. Play this tune with me and I'll leave once it's over. Then you can continue to enjoy your pitiful life in peace.

**Xenon**<br>
... If that'll get rid of you.

*\[Guitar\]*

*[»»»Fast Forward»»»]*

**ConneR**<br>
This truly is a wonderful piece. You can hear the elegant and exquisite flow of emotions. If Miss Pauline could hear it once more, she'd definitely be moved, wouldn't she?

**Xenon**<br>
……

**ConneR**<br>
Look at you. Are you crying? There's no need to keep it in.

**Xenon**<br>
... Shut up.

**ConneR**<br>
You haven't cried at all since then? I bet every time something bad happens to you, you always keep it bottled up inside. If someone ever forgets that tears can heal, music is always there to remind them.

**Xenon**<br>
……

**ConneR**<br>
As we agreed upon, I'll be leaving. Wish you the best of luck, Mr. Jackson.

**Xenon**<br>
... What exactly is the point of you coming here?

**ConneR**<br>
Perhaps you should ask those tears that are streaming down your face why? You wanted revenge but exacted it on the wrong person. If you still have a little bit of motivation, we've already got information on the real culprit. You're welcome to join the team whenever you want, what do you say?

**Xenon**<br>
……<br>
No.

**ConneR**<br>
……

**Xenon**<br>
This stuff, it's all pointless now.

**ConneR**<br>
Is that so? If you believe that stopping a worldwide terrorist attack and disaster is pointless, then I won't force you.

**Xenon**<br>
……!

**ConneR**<br>
Interested now?

**Xenon**<br>
……<br>
No. Get the hell out of here.

**ConneR**<br>
... What a shame. Okay then, see you again soon... Maybe.
