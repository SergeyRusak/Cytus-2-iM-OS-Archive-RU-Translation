*\[Power on\]*

**Kyuu Hou Kai Member**<br>
The power is restored...!?

**Member D**<br>
Quick! We need to get there as fast as possible!

*[→Signal Switches]*

**PAFF**<br>
The power is back!

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Sis Cherry!

*[→Signal Switches]*

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Member D**<br>
Miss She...rry...

**Kyuu Hou Kai Member**<br>
......! Oh god, what's the deal with this chaotic mess!?

**Member D**<br>
Attention to all medical staff. Return to your positions ASAP. Miss Sherry is not showing any vital signs. Reboot the life support system immediately. 

**Member D**<br>
Miss Sherry! Can you hear me? Hang in there!

**Kyuu Hou Kai Member**<br>
Daigo, she's already...

**Member D**<br>
Shut up! Did you not hear me!? Do as I say!!

*\[Door Opens\]*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Sis Cherry!

**PAFF**<br>
Is she alright!?

**Member D**<br>
OUT! We're doing an emergency operation on her.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Sis Cherry! Sis Cherry! No...! Waaaahh...

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

**Member D**<br>
......

**Kyuu Hou Kai Member**<br>
... They did everything they could...

**PAFF**<br>
... *\*Sobs\**...

**Hayato**<br>
... Damn it...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Sis Cherry! Sis Cherry!<br>
Why did this happen!? HEY! Say something! Say something, baldy...!

*\[Punching and hitting\]*

**Member D**<br>
......

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Safest place in the entire Node my a\*\*! Liars! You're all a bunch of...

*\[Punching and hitting\]*

**Hayato**<br>
NEKO! Calm down!

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
How can I calm down!? Sis Cherry is... is... WAAAAHHHHHH!!

**Member D**<br>
... I'm sorry...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
What's the point of saying sorry now!?

**Member D**<br>
We don't want things to be like this either!

**[Nora]**<br>
*Enough.*

**Member D**<br>
... Chief.

**PAFF**<br>
Nora...?

**[Nora]**<br>
*I'm the one who is responsible for her death. Please don't blame it on the other members.*

**Member D**<br>
Chief, what are you talking about...?

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

**[Nora]**<br>
*... And that was how things went. It was me who failed to make an immediate decision.*

**PAFF**<br>
Nora, this is not your fault...

**Hayato**<br>
NEKO, have you calmed down now? I'm going to let go.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
......<br>
... Xenon... Where's Xenon!?

**Member D**<br>
We don't know. By the time we got here, he was already gone... Everything in the room was smashed. We have no idea what actually happened...

**[Nora]**<br>
*He's the one who smashed everything in the room, I believe. During the blackout, no one was able to leave or enter this room. It was during that time that Miss Pauline... He bore the brunt of all this. It must be truly painful.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*Daigo, send Miss Pauline back to her family and ensure that the people in 08 take good care of everything, including her father.*

*\[Door Opens\]*

**PAFF**<br>
NEKO? Where are you going!?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
... Home...

**Hayato**<br>
Hey! NEKO!

**[Nora]**<br>
*Let her go. Daigo, make sure someone's escorting her. At least make sure she arrives home safely.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*Just as Miss Asakura said, this place indeed can't be considered safe anymore. I underestimated the enemy's ability and put my guests through this kind of risk... I'm no longer qualified to make a promise for your safety. From now on, you don't have to stay here anymore. *
