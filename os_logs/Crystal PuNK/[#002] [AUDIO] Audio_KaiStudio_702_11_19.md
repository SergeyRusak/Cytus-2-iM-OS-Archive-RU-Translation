**Xenon**<br>
Yikes, you weren't kidding about this place being dirty...

**KAI**<br>
Welp, told you we haven't used it in a long time. If it really bothers you, we can clean it, since we have no idea how long you guys are staying.

**Cherry**<br>
We're likely staying until that guy contacts us. If we want to clear Simon's name, we must investigate and find out the truth.

**KAI**<br>
But you're in 03 now, how are you going to investigate? Doesn't this put you further and further away from the incident?

**Cherry**<br>
R must have his own ideas. Right now, we can only trust him. 

**Xenon**<br>
The Æsir incident didn't just occur in 08. The cyTus malfunction and the subsequent damage caused was a worldwide event. Judging from his hypothesis, all of this is connected, and the actual scale might be much larger than any of us imagined.

**KAI**<br>
That R... Based on what I heard from JOE, he is a pretty dangerous person. You guys seem to trust him a lot?

**Cherry**<br>
On our way here, we were stuck at the automatic transportation hub for an entire week. Without his help, we never would've survived... Although I still don't understand him at all, I feel like he's not really a bad person... I think.

**Xenon**<br>
Hey, do you only have brooms? Where are the rags?

**KAI**<br>
So you really started cleaning... Even the clean freak part of you didn't change.

**Cherry**<br>
Let me help out too.

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

**KAI**<br>
Whew\~ That's more than enough, right? Didn't think this equipment and instruments are still able to function.

**Cherry**<br>
Where's Simon?

**KAI**<br>
He said he's going outside to make a phone call, so he took my phone and ran outside.

*[→Signal Switches]*

*[Call Starts]*

**Xenon**<br>
It's me.

**[JOE]**<br>
*Oh! You're using KAI's phone. So this means you guys are safe?*

**Xenon**<br>
Yes, we are safe, so far at least. Thanks.

**[JOE]**<br>
*No problemo\~<br>
Big sis' cat is also with me. Tell her not to worry.*

**Xenon**<br>
Got it. If anything happens, I'll contact you again.

**[JOE]**<br>
*Ah, one more thing. NEKO and PAFF are staying at my place right now. Do you want to talk to her? *

**Xenon**<br>
... Yeah.

**[JOE]**<br>
*NEKO... NEKO! Wake up!*

**[NEKO]**<br>
*Muuuuu.... ten more minutes...*

**[JOE]**<br>
*It's a call from Xenon\~*

**[NEKO]**<br>
*None*

**Xenon**<br>
... Are you sleeping? Isn't it suppose to be daytime over there?

**[NEKO]**<br>
*You're safe... thank goodness! Ah! Right! Do you know! Aroma\-chan... no! PAFF is...!*

**Xenon**<br>
I've heard it from JOE. Are you guys also coming to 03 soon?

**[NEKO]**<br>
*Yep. Someone will help us get there. We plan to depart for 03 tomorrow.*

**Xenon**<br>
Understood. Take care of yourself.

**[NEKO]**<br>
*Where are you guys now? How are we going to meet up?*

**Xenon**<br>
Meet up? No, I think it's better if we don't meet up for now. There are still too many things we're not certain about. We should keep a low profile for a while.

**[NEKO]**<br>
*Muuu... You two know nothing about that place. Isn't it better to have someone like NEKO around?*

**Xenon**<br>
You still have to deal with PAFF's issues, right? We have friends from 03 here to help us. We'll be fine.

**[NEKO]**<br>
*Muuu...*

**Xenon**<br>
That's it for now. I will contact you again. Be careful yourself. Don't get into trouble again, understand?

**[NEKO]**<br>
*I'm not THAT careless!*

**[NEKO]**<br>
*... You be careful yourself too. Bye\-bye.*

*[Call Ends]*
