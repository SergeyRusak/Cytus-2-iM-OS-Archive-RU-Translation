*\[Equipment operating\]*

**[Nora]**<br>
*The examination is complete. Miss Kaori Minamiya, how does your body feel?*

**PAFF**<br>
Oh, I'm feeling pretty good. 

**[Nora]**<br>
*Great, I'll escort you back to your room.*

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

**[Nora]**<br>
*... It seems like your condition is much better than mine. Although you haven't fully mastered the ability yet, your body is rather stable despite the virus activity in your body being 15% higher than mine.*

**PAFF**<br>
Is that so...?

**[Nora]**<br>
*You say you remember that when you were kidna... taken to Node 08, you came in contact with the virus due to an accident during the transport, is that correct?*

**PAFF**<br>
Yes. That time, the truck rolled over in the forbidden area... My body fell out of the storage cell. I think it was then when I came in contact with the virus.

**[Nora]**<br>
*I'll skip directly to conclusions: Although you and I have the same ability traits, I believe that your power is perhaps greater than mine. If you can learn how to properly control it... Do you remember what I taught you before?*

**PAFF**<br>
Yes... Even though Nora told me to avoid using the ability these few days, to be honest, I tried to go to the place Mr. Xenon described again yesterday. However, I discovered that this time, I can no longer connect that far into that place...

**[Nora]**<br>
*From the examination report, that doesn't look like it has anything to do with the state of your body... Perhaps it's "fear" that is stopping you.*

**PAFF**<br>
... Eh?

**[Nora]**<br>
*The state of your mind will affect your condition when you enter into the OS space. Sometimes, there will be things that you don't wish to experience a second time. This will cause the ability to trigger a "brake" whenever you try to access those things again. I've experienced this many times already.*

**PAFF**<br>
......

**[Nora]**<br>
*I forbid you from using the ability on your own when you're conscious. It's way too dangerous. <br>
I will continue to train you until you are able to fully control it. When that time comes, you may try again.*

**PAFF**<br>
I know... I'm sorry. <br>
However, it seems pretty obvious that Nora didn't want me to use the power even after I learn how to. Why the change of heart now...?

**[Nora]**<br>
*……<br>
In all honesty, those images you described, that hatred... I've encountered it in the past by accident as well. But I didn't think too much of it back then. However, the clues and hypothesis brought to me by Mr. Simon Jackson and Co., on top of all the things that have happened to you guys, make me feel that the severity of this is much higher than what I considered back then.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*All in all, the most important character right now is you. Please follow my commands on this.*

**PAFF**<br>
Okay...

*\[Music\]*

**Nora**<br>
……<br>
……?

*\[Door Opens\]*

*\[Music\]*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Ahh! Aroma\-chan... Wahh, Nora....!

**[Nora]**<br>
*… Fellow guests, I believe I've told you before that you are prohibited from entering this room.*

**Hayato**<br>
Sorry...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Why!? I feel real bad for Ropohead staying here all alone by himself. We just came here to play some music with him, that's all... Plus, Nora\-chan is incredible! All these instruments, you made all of them yourself!? They all sounded amazing!

**Hayato**<br>
Hey! NEKO...!

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Nora\-chan and Aroma\-chan should play with us too! It'll definitely be a lot of fun!

**PAFF**<br>
Eh? Umm...

**[Nora]**<br>
*It's fine. Go ahead. You need a good rest anyway.*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Ehh\~? What about Nora\-chan?

**[Nora]**<br>
*I have work I must attend to.*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Muuuu... okay\~<br>
Aroma\-chan! We just made some amazing sounding chords!

*\[Synthesizer\]*

**[Nora]**<br>
*……<br>
That synth, if you turn the Reso up, it'll sound better.*

*\[Door Closes\]*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Ehhh...? She left right after she said it... So Nora\-chan still really wants to make music after all.

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Affirmative. This unit, detect slight fluctuations in Nora's emotions.*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Okay then! We're definitely gonna think of a way to let Nora remember the joys of making music!
