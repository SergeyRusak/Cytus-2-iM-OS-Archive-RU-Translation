**Cherry**<br>
We plan to meet them at that crossroad, right?

**Xenon**<br>
Yeah. Sidenote, exactly why did you tag along again?

**Cherry**<br>
Ha? Did you forget what your identity is right now? Two people walking around together tends to attract less attention. You need to learn from me about how to keep a low profile. Or, is there some kind of reason you don't want me to tag along...?

**Xenon**<br>
Rest assured. My guess is that for the time being, the admins in 08 probably won't pursue me as actively as they had.

**Cherry**<br>
Eh? How so?

**Xenon**<br>
Think about it. The reason why they were in such a hurry to convict me was to put an end to this incident and prevent someone else from conducting further investigations. The real Æsir was never caught. In other words, me being on the run right now gives them the perfect excuse if Æsir ever decides to act again. They can just blame it all on me and rationalize the whole thing.

**Cherry**<br>
The things they don't want people to investigate further, is it the stuff R talked about? About The Decommission and Architects...

**Xenon**<br>
Yes. I don't know what A.R.C. or the admins are planning. Nevertheless, there's definitely a bigger secret behind all this. If that's the case, perhaps the things PAFF encountered also has something to do with this. This is what I want to confirm after we meet up with NEKO.

**Cherry**<br>
NEKO... In the last performance we had together, I was in a hurry and never had the chance to properly talk with her. Didn't think we could meet up with her in 03.

**Xenon**<br>
... I merely plan to meet up with her so we can update each other about what's going on. We won't talk for too long.

**Cherry**<br>
So they brought PAFF back here to search for her memories, is it...? Now that you mention it, the Æsir attacks really do have a lot to do with memories.

**Xenon**<br>
To be honest, judging from what NEKO said, "that concert" also seems to be one of the reasons behind PAFF's messed\-up memory.

**Cherry**<br>
Not only making you the scapegoat but also involving PAFF... what exactly is he trying to achieve with these actions?

**Xenon**<br>
No idea. All in all, let's meet up first. Maybe we can obtain more information. On top of that... if we can figure out Æsir's real identity, it should also help PAFF out.

**Cherry**<br>
I almost forgot; you're a diehard Cream Puff yourself.

**Xenon**<br>
... I just find her singing voice to be quite good. Nothing more.

**Cherry**<br>
Ho, really? Then compared to mine, which one do you prefer?

**Xenon**<br>
Based on what? The comparison doesn't work. She sings mostly pop music.

**Cherry**<br>
PAFF is a really nice person. Although we didn't talk much at Mono, she was always very humble and polite.<br>
Alright then, I've decided. I'll help introduce you two to each other!

**Xenon**<br>
Don't make the situation more complicated...

**Cherry**<br>
What, you got a problem with that? Our actions can also help her out, right?

**Xenon**<br>
That's just speculation...<br>
Look out!

*\[Horn\]*

**Cherry**<br>
Hey! That's dangerous!

**Thug**<br>
Outta my way, outta my way! You wanna get f\*\*\*\*\* killed?

**Cherry**<br>
This is the sidewalk!

**Xenon**<br>
Sherry, forget about it. This is 03. Trash like that is everywhere. No need to get into an argument.

**Thug**<br>
Huuh!? Who you calling trash!? You sissy\-looking piece of s\*\*\*!

*\[Loads gun\]*

**Cherry**<br>
I advise you to put your gun down.

*\[Loads gun\]*

**Thug**<br>
Hoho? You got guts to point a gun at me. Do you know who I am!?

**Xenon**<br>
... 

*\[Hacking\]*

**Xenon**<br>
Mr. Ono, is it? Member of the Hou Sang Tang.

**Thug**<br>
......!? How did you know my name...?

**Xenon**<br>
Apologies. I am Sid Jackson, an expat executive for Mogura. This is my ID.

*\[Data projection\]*

**Thug**<br>
Eh...? Eek!?

**Xenon**<br>
Both of you, please, lower your guns. Apologies, this is my wife and she tends to be a bit impulsive. However, if I recall correctly, Hou Sang Tang is a subsidiary of Mogura, isn't it? A Hou Sang Tang member pointing a gun at the family of a Mogura executive, in Node 03 too; I wonder what that implies?

**Cherry**<br>
......

**Thug**<br>
Umm, N, no... Sir, please hear me out...

**Xenon**<br>
... If you don't want the guys above you to hear about this, I suggest you leave, now. I'll pretend I didn't see all this.

**Thug**<br>
Y\-yes sir! Thank you so much for your kindness! I'm so sorry!

*\[Engine sounds\]*

**Cherry**<br>
Pff... Pffft hahaha! Wife, eh? Not bad, not bad at all! Can't believe that actually fooled him. Your acting was god awful!

**Xenon**<br>
... Be quiet, will you? I've browsed all the data stored by the admins here. Forging an ID that can fool a low\-level thug like that is relatively easy.

**Cherry**<br>
... Are all hackers this arrogant? Both you and that Æsir.

**Xenon**<br>
Don't group us together. I will never use this technique to harm others.

**Cherry**<br>
Nonetheless, your acting just now... Hahahaha! Oh, I can't! I just can't! God that was so funny...<br>
Hahahaha...

**Xenon**<br>
Aren't you laughing a bit too hard...?

**Cherry**<br>
Haha... eh? Hey... look, isn't that the thug we just encountered? Why is he laying in front of the hospital entrance?

**Xenon**<br>
Did he fall down out of panic...?

**Cherry**<br>
Simon! Look at those drones in front of the hospital entrance... They just stopped there and aren't doing anything. That's really suspicious. Armed models... are they the admins' machines?

**Xenon**<br>
Hey, is that guy bleeding...?

**Cherry**<br>
Could it be, the drones...<br>
......!?

**Xenon**<br>
What's the matter?

**Cherry**<br>
Get down!!!

*\[Explosion\]*
