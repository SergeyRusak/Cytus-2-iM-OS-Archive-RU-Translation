**[Platform Announcement]**<br>
*Attention, fellow passengers. The express train directly to Node 08 is now arriving at the platform. For your own safety, please stand behind the yellow line.*

**PAFF**<br>
Ah, Mr. Neumann and NEKO are here.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Aroma\-chan!

**ConneR**<br>
Good evening to you all.

**[Nora]**<br>
*Looks like you weren't able to get Mr. Jackson back.*

**ConneR**<br>
Unfortunately. However, with the morose state he is in now, I don't think he could be of much help anyway.

**[Nora]**<br>
*... I understand. I truly do feel sorry for him. <br>
Well then, before we set out, let's confirm our plan one last time.*

**ConneR**<br>
I'll speak first. It may appear that out of nowhere, we've decided to head to Node 08 in a hurry. Besides the fact that we're short on time, there is also another issue. That is——although we currently have Miss PAFF's ability, the effect seems to differ in terms of its range.

**[Nora]**<br>
*That's correct. Since we've already locked onto our key target——Ivy is very likely is in 08, I believe it will be best if we can resolve everything there.*

**ConneR**<br>
On top of that, although the little kitten and loverboy are moving around with us right now, I suggest that as soon as we arrive there you two find a safe place to hide.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ、Hayato**<br>
\- EHHH!?<br>
\- Hey!?

**ConneR**<br>
I'll be frank. Although your courage and will are indeed worthy of admiration, there is absolutely nothing you can offer in terms of helping us with the operation. In fact, if you stay, you'll be a serious burden.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ、Hayato**<br>
……

**[Nora]**<br>
*I agree with Mr. Neumann. Things may become very dangerous. For those without particular skill sets, it's best that you stay out of it.*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
How come…

**PAFF**<br>
NEKO, Hayato, I agree with them too. You two have helped me sooo much, but from now on, it'll have to be on me. It's my turn to protect you guys this time!

**Hayato**<br>
Oh…

**ConneR**<br>
Miss PAFF, once we arrive there, we may need you to make contact with Ivy in that so\-called "OS" space immediately. Before that...... ROBO\_Head.

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Yes.*

**ConneR**<br>
Are you sure the method you mentioned previously can work?

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Report: Initial calculations, results, plausible.*

**Nora**<br>
……

**ConneR**<br>
Good. If that's the case, I might just have a chance to help Miss PAFF while she's in that space.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
……?

**[Platform Announcement]**<br>
*Attention, fellow passengers. The express train directly to Node 08 is now arriving at the platform. For your own safety, please stand behind the yellow line.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*It's time.*

*[Signal Lost]*
