**[Nora]**<br>
*The report is almost done. One moment, please.*

**PAFF**<br>
......

**[Nora]**<br>
*Miss Kaori Minamiya, what's the matter? Are you not feeling well?*

**PAFF**<br>
Eh? No... I'm thinking about the things I saw in Node 08 yesterday. It really freaked everyone out...

**[Nora]**<br>
*......<br>
You mentioned that you felt it, right? A sensation that's exactly the same as that time.*

**PAFF**<br>
Yes... though I'm not exactly sure. I still can't properly focus my mind at a location this far away.

**[Nora]**<br>
*Take it slowly. You'll get used to it.*

**PAFF**<br>
Another thing... Can you not refer to me only as Kaori Minamiya? I prefer you call me PAFF.

**[Nora]**<br>
*"Only"? Your body is without a doubt Kaori Minamiya's body.*

**PAFF**<br>
I know. Nonetheless, to me, Aroma's memory... the other personality of mine is also something that actually exists. I don't want to disregard or only accept one of them...

**[Nora]**<br>
*Understood, Miss PAFF.*

**PAFF**<br>
Thank you. Nora... you're a very kind person, despite your appearance making you look difficult to approach. We've all heard your story from ROBO. Everyone... 

**[Nora]**<br>
*No need to pity me, and no need to think about trying to help me. We can't choose where we're born, but we can choose how we live. This is the way of life I choose myself.*

**PAFF**<br>
I didn't mean that... but that's true. I never thought I would become what I am now either. Nora really is strong\-willed... If it was me, I might not be able to do the same...

**[Nora]**<br>
*You escaped a controlled environment all by yourself. You traveled this far to search for the truth of your being. On top of that, everything you're doing now; they're all results from your own choices. You're not weak, or I should say, no longer weak. Don't you agree?*

**PAFF**<br>
You have a point. Thank you.<br>
Ah, since I rarely have the chance to talk with you like this, I have a few questions I want to ask you... but I'm not sure if they'll offend you or not. May I?

**[Nora]**<br>
*Go ahead, please.*

**PAFF**<br>
With Kyuu Hou Kai... No, even with the general technology available right now, crafting a pair of prosthetics that will allow you to walk again shouldn't be that difficult, right? Why is Nora still using a wheelchair?

**[Nora]**<br>
*......<br>
This wheelchair, is a gift from Phoenix. I have no intention to leave it. Kyuu Hou Kai is the only place where I need to move around. If I'm going outside, there's Daigo. This is more than sufficient enough.*

**PAFF**<br>
Is that so...?

**[Nora]**<br>
*Any other questions?*

**PAFF**<br>
... If... I overuse my ability, will my eyes... end up like yours?

**[Nora]**<br>
*......<br>
I don't know. But judging from the examination report, we don't have to worry about it any time soon. Your body has high compatibility with the virus, though whether this is a good thing or not is still to be determined.*

**PAFF**<br>
Is that so...

**[Nora]**<br>
*... Technically speaking, my eyes aren't actually "blind". However, my optic nerves have been locked deep inside the OS space. Therefore, to see the things that are physically in front of me, I have to rely on footage live\-recorded by these instruments. It's not exactly easy to see them very clearly in that space. Without these instruments, I won't be able to see anything... Not sure if you can understand this explanation.*

**PAFF**<br>
Yes. Just like you've mentioned before, if I can't master this ability, my entire mind may end up getting trapped inside...

**[Nora]**<br>
*"Virtual\-internet Related Post\-Traumatic Stress Disorder", or VR PTSD for short, is a medically recognized disease. According to my research, our situation may be similar to this. In addition, this disease doesn't just affect ability users who are immune to the virus. If regular people suffer excessive impact and stimulation while connected, it may result in a situation where they too have a part of their mind trapped inside that space. *

**[Nora]**<br>
*In other words, cyTus... the technology of the entire Library itself and the secrets it hides are deeply related to us. This is also a major subject of the virus research I took over from Phoenix.*

**PAFF**<br>
"The Ender"... what exactly is it? And what is the thing I saw when I connected to the Library...?

**[Nora]**<br>
*It is still unclear, but I believe that everything will be cleared up soon.<br>
Thanks to you, the vaccine for the virus has made new progress. Perhaps in a few days, we'll be able to develop a sample using this new module. *

**PAFF**<br>
For real!? That's great news!

**[Nora]**<br>
*Don't get your hopes up too high. All I did was take your genes and adjusted them according to theories and formulas. Whether or not this has any actual effect is still to be determined.*

*[Signal Lost]*
