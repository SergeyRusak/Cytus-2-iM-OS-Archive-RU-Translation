Whew... all done.

**Cherry**<br>
So you made them attack each other... Couldn't you give me a heads\-up first!? That was scary as f\*\*\*!

**Xenon**<br>
I said that I was going to finish them all off in one go, right? Rather than waste time controlling the core system, tampering with the target selection system is the fastest way to deal with them.

**Cherry**<br>
... You little... Where did the "keep a low profile" part go? Good thing that the civilians have all escaped. What if the drones accidentally struck someone? Creating such a huge ruckus, I say we've attracted the attention of every living soul in Node 03.

**Xenon**<br>
At least both of us didn't show our faces. Can't complain about that. Better get out of here before anyone notices us...

**Xenon**<br>
I've already contacted NEKO and told her we'll meet up someday later. Let's go back first. We caused a pretty major commotion. It's best that we go back into hiding for now.

**Cherry**<br>
Yeah... Whew, let's go...

**Xenon**<br>
Hey, you okay? Can you walk?

**Cherry**<br>
Yeah, I can... Hah... Owww...

**Xenon**<br>
You twisted your ankle, didn't you? Why are you trying to act tough? Gimme your hand.

**Cherry**<br>
... Eh? Umm...

**Child C**<br>
Waahhh\~\~ Daddy!

**Pedestrian A**<br>
You're safe! Daddy was so worried...

**Child C**<br>
Yes... a lady saved me...

**Pedestrian B**<br>
I really saw it! Two masked people, one with a gun and one with some sort of unknown gadget, trashed all those drones! Dude, they were so cool and awesome!

**Cherry**<br>
......

**Xenon**<br>
So, how was it? Using your ability to help other people, felt pretty good, right? <br>
Partner?

*\[Carries on shoulder\]*

**Cherry**<br>
... Yeah.

*\[Footsteps\]*
