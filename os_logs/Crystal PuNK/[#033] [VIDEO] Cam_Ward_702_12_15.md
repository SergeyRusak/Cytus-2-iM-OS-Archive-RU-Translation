*\[Kicks Door\]*

**Xenon**<br>
Damnit! Can't open it.<br>
Hey! Is anyone there!?

**Xenon**<br>
......

**Xenon**<br>
The backup lighting is still on... Only the main power source is dead, is it?

**Cherry**<br>
... Ugh...

**Xenon**<br>
Sherry!? Are you awake?<br>
So this means that the entire life support system has stopped functioning...?

**Cherry**<br>
Haa... I feel... awful...

**Xenon**<br>
......!<br>
Hang in there. I'll call someone here right away!

*\[Kicks Door\]*

**Xenon**<br>
My device is also outside, or else I would've had a chance to hack this door open...<br>
... What exactly is going on?

**Cherry**<br>
Haah...

**Xenon**<br>
Sherry, are you alright?

**Cherry**<br>
... Can you come closer? I want you... by my side.

**Xenon**<br>
... Yeah.

*\[Footsteps\]*

*\[Holds Hand\]*

**Cherry**<br>
Feels like... I had a really weird dream...

**Xenon**<br>
......

**Cherry**<br>
... I was standing on a pitch\-black water surface, constantly looking for a flower... A blue... illuminating flower. Whenever I was about to touch it, it disappeared. This repeated itself, again and again...

**Xenon**<br>
......

**Cherry**<br>
For some reason, I feel... that it's something very important. If I don't find it... I will lose everything...

**Cherry**<br>
If I can return to the dream, maybe I'll be able to find it this time.

**Xenon**<br>
It's just a dream.<br>
Don't fall asleep. The system should be restored very soon. Nora would never leave a situation like this unaddressed.

**Cherry**<br>
... Yeah.<br>
I kind of understand what you meant by "let go of the past" now... Perhaps the thing I want to pursue never existed in the first place...

**Xenon**<br>
......

**Cherry**<br>
But... you're here.

**Xenon**<br>
... Yes, I'm here.

**Cherry**<br>
Hey, sing "Still" for me...

**Xenon**<br>
......

**Cherry**<br>
Come on... it's not like there's anybody else here...

**Xenon**<br>
... Okay.

**Xenon**<br>
*\*You don't have to cover yourself<br>
when no one can be trusted<br>
I'm still here standing beside you<br>
but they tore us apart <br>
and I still keep you inside my broken heart\**

**Xenon**<br>
......

**Cherry**<br>
...... Haha......<br>
... Your singing...<br>
sucks......

**Xenon**<br>
Sherry...?

**Cherry**<br>
......

**Xenon**<br>
......
