**Cherry**<br>
How was it? Anything on the situation? 

**Member D**<br>
... From what I've heard, the block was half\-destroyed. Not only did the signal tower get blown to pieces, but the bar you guys mentioned has also collapsed entirely.

**Cherry**<br>
For real!?

**Member D**<br>
That's what the report I received said. The owner's body hasn't been discovered, so we can't determine whether he's dead or alive yet... We'll continue to wait for updates.

**Xenon**<br>
That's all we can do now, Sherry. Let's wait a bit longer.

**Cherry**<br>
Yeah... Thanks a lot for the help, Mr. Daigo.

**Member D**<br>
No need to thank me. It's an instruction from Chief. <br>
We have members in 08 for certain missions, to begin with. Gathering information about this attack is one of their missions too.

**Cherry**<br>
Nora... Kyuu Hou Kai has deployed members to 08 as well?

**Member D**<br>
We always have. Although Kyuu Hou Kai's growth relies mostly on technology, the pipelines for materials and resources are equally important. That's why we have members deployed there. Regarding the recent attacks, Chief issued an order very early on, stating that we all pay close attention to these incidents to ensure that they wouldn't affect us.

**Xenon**<br>
Yet you guys never imagined that these attacks were meant to target Kyuu Hou Kai in the first place. 

**Member D**<br>
That's right... The identity of the mastermind is already very obvious. This string of attacks is definitely all Diego's doing.

**Cherry**<br>
... But, Diego's targets should be Kyuu Hou Kai and us. Why would he carry out attacks in 08, his base of operations...

**Member D**<br>
In their previous attack on Kyubo Medical Center, Mr.Jackson defeated their hackers. You also helped Chief strengthen our firewalls, right? In order to break through our defenses here, Diego is using the city he resides in as a practice field. It might sound absurd, but since this is Diego we're talking about, it's entirely possible.

**Xenon**<br>
Indeed. I've seen the summary list of all the enhancements Nora has done to Kyuu Hou Kai. Calling this place a "fortress" is a severe understatement. This is not a place where you can break through with a mere few drones. Using other Nodes to test out tactics and act as a smokescreen to hide the actual plan, that's a very reasonable speculation.

**Member D**<br>
... Mr. Jackson, that list is an encrypted document of the highest security level. If Diego somehow managed to know the structure of the base...

**Xenon**<br>
Sorry, I'll keep that in mind.<br>
Nevertheless, I helped you guys enhance your firewall. I don't think it's unreasonable for me to have some understanding of the defense mechanisms here, right?

**Member D**<br>
Hmm...

**Cherry**<br>
You can leave it to this guy, Mr. Daigo. As long as he's around, you don't need to worry about problems on the internet... Can't say the same about his aim with a gun though; he kinda sucks at that.

**Xenon**<br>
Shut up.

**Member D**<br>
But you're our guests. We should be the ones taking care of outside enemies...

**Cherry**<br>
Don't say that. Since we're already in the same boat now, let us help out! This isn't just for our own safety. Nora helped us with so many things; it's just natural that we repay some of the favors.

**Member D**<br>
... Alright then. I'll leave this to you two. Thank you.

**Cherry**<br>
You're welcome. Speaking of which, where's Nora?

*[â†’Signal Switches]*

**[Nora]**<br>
*Apologies, for asking to use your eyes at this time of the night.*

**PAFF**<br>
It's alright. I'm also very worried about JOE. Even though it still isn't very stable, a quick attempt... should be alright.

**[Nora]**<br>
*Got it. I'll adjust the monitor settings first. One moment, please.*

*\[Typing on keyboard\]*

**PAFF**<br>
I heard from NEKO that Miss Cherry appears to be tangled up with people from a gang. The previous attack on the hospital was their doing... Could it be, that it's the same situation this time?

**[Nora]**<br>
*Certainly can't deny the possibility. However, I still need more information before I can make a decision. The fact that you're willing to lend your ability for me to use is a godsend for Kyuu Hou Kai... You have my sincere gratitude.*

**PAFF**<br>
It's okay, I don't mind helping. Besides...

**[Nora]**<br>
*Besides?*

**PAFF**<br>
Even though Nora said that this ability is a curse, and I've never wished for such an ability... if it's for everyone's safety, I am more than willing to use it. In that case, this curse now has the value and reason to exist... The same goes for me too.

**Nora**<br>
......

**PAFF**<br>
Nora also feels the same way, right? That's why you're working so hard to research the true nature of this ability.

**[Nora]**<br>
*... Understanding the mechanisms behind the ability is my current objective. As with how to utilize it, be it based on morality, ethics, or personal decisions, that's something for the future.*

**PAFF**<br>
......

**[Nora]**<br>
*... I said too much. Regardless, there are still many unsolved secrets surrounding ability users. Please be sure to take good care of your condition.*

**PAFF**<br>
Yes... I understand.

*\[Typing on keyboard\]*

**[Nora]**<br>
*I've finished adjusting the settings. Miss Kaori Minamiya, the target is the attack incident that occurred earlier today at Node 08. You can begin now.*

**PAFF**<br>
Got it... Hmmm... Ah, I can see it! It's just like last time, so many images and voices...

**[Nora]**<br>
*Very good. Focus on the key points you want to search.*

**PAFF**<br>
I see... a person... I think that's JOE? He's arguing with another person on the side of the street...

**[Nora]**<br>
*... At least we can confirm that Mr. Miller is safe. Can you take a look at the recording of the drones that attacked the site?*

**PAFF**<br>
Got it. Let me try... Ugh!?

**[Nora]**<br>
*!? Why all of a sudden...*

*\[Things crashing\]*

**PAFF**<br>
Ah! Whew... I'm... back?

**[Nora]**<br>
*... Miss Kaori Minamiya, are you awake? Do you recognize me?*

**PAFF**<br>
Y...... Yes. Nora... Just now, I did what Nora said and searched the drones in the attack incident. But then the images just suddenly...

**[Nora]**<br>
*It seems that you're still unable to maintain a connection for an extended amount of time. This is normal. Despite that, I can't help but notice the abnormal numbers displayed right before your disconnection. Please try your best to recall; what did you feel back there?*

**PAFF**<br>
... This massive sense of oppression, coming in from all directions. I was almost unable to breathe... This sensation... I think I've felt it before.

**[Nora]**<br>
*Felt it before?*

**PAFF**<br>
Yes... If I think carefully about it... That's right! It's the same sensation I felt that time...

**Nora**<br>
......

*[Signal Lost]*
