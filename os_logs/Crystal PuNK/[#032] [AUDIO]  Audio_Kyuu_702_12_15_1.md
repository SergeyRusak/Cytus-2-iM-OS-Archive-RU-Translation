**Member D**<br>
What is going on!?

**Kyuu Hou Kai Member**<br>
No idea! The power suddenly went out!

**Member D**<br>
Damnit! Diego, haven't you had enough with your bulls\*\*\*!!<br>
Machine team, report!

**[Kyuu Hou Kai Member]**<br>
*Machine team here. The system suddenly went berserk and stopped responding. We've been hacked!*

**Member D**<br>
Activate backup power immediately!

**[Kyuu Hou Kai Member]**<br>
*We're already trying, but the only thing that has worked is a small portion of the backup lighting. We are unable to provide power to all other systems...*

**[Nora]**<br>
*Da......<br>
Daigo...... Daigo! Can you hear me?*

**Member D**<br>
Chief!? This is Daigo. The signal is very weak. What is happening!?

**[Nora]**<br>
*I'm not sure either. Report the situation outside to me immediately.*

**Member D**<br>
The entire power supply for Kyuu Hou Kai has gone offline! We are currently investigating the reason. Not certain if this is yet another attack... Where is Chief now!?

**[Nora]**<br>
*... I'm in ROBO's room. There's an old terminal here. I'll use it to connect to the system and see what's going on.*

**[Kyuu Hou Kai Member]**<br>
*Daigo! Bad news!*

**Member D**<br>
What is it?

**[Kyuu Hou Kai Member]**<br>
*The virus vaccine sample in the central lab has been destroyed!*

**Member D**<br>
Vaccine sample? The one made from Kaori Minamiya's genes... So the attack on area 03 was just a bait to lure all our forces to that location? Damnit, what the hell is Diego trying to do!?

**Member D**<br>
......!<br>
Miss Pauline! Medical team, report! Is anyone nearby Miss Pauline's ward!?

**[Kyuu Hou Kai Member]**<br>
*Report, all the entrances have failed. The only person inside is Mr. Jackson...*

**Member D**<br>
Destroy the door! No matter what we do, restoring power to the life support system is of utmost priority!

**[Kyuu Hou Kai Member]**<br>
*No good... There's no way we can destroy the reinforced door designed by Chief with what we have now... I'm so sorry!*

**Member D**<br>
F\*\*\*! Is there nothing we can do!?<br>
Move! I'm gonna blow this door open.

**Kyuu Hou Kai Member**<br>
Hey!?

**Member D**<br>
There's no other way about it!

**Kyuu Hou Kai Member**<br>
Even if we get there, how are we gonna reboot the life support system...

**Member D**<br>
Shut your piehole! Did you forget who saved all our a\*\*es just now!

*\[Explosion\]*

**Member D**<br>
Good, this will work.<br>
All of you, come with me!

**Kyuu Hou Kai Member**<br>
... Yes, sir!
