**Member D**<br>
Diego… I don't remember inviting Baro onto our turf. What are you doing here with so many people?

**Diego**<br>
Relax. Today, I've got some things I need to discuss with the Chief about, not some barking dog like you.

*\[Loads gun\]*

**Member D**<br>
Chief doesn't want to use violence against the likes of you. Therefore, I'll give you ten seconds to get the hell out of here.

**Angus**<br>
Hey, s\*\*\*head! What do you think you're doing!?

**Diego**<br>
Angus, put the gun down. <br>
It's okay if she doesn't come out. I'll just say it right here. She's watching anyway, right?

**Member D**<br>
You...

**[Nora]**<br>
*Daigo, come back.*

**Member D**<br>
Chief!?

**[Nora]**<br>
*The work in Area A requires your assistance. Come back.*

**Member D**<br>
Yes, Chief...

**Angus**<br>
Hmph, bye\-bye little doggy.

*\[Door Closes\]*

**Diego**<br>
Nora, what's wrong? Don't just hide out in there. Come out and chat, won't you?

**[Nora]**<br>
*Diego, our routine meeting is not today.*

**Diego**<br>
Certainly. I know that very well. Despite that, my boys couldn't wait any longer. All you need to do is hand over the people we're looking for and we'll leave this place immediately. We won't leave a trace.

**[Nora]**<br>
*What people?*

**Diego**<br>
It's not like you to feign ignorance.<br>
I've received news that Simon Jackson and Sherry Pauline are currently hiding here. These two have interfered into the weapon transaction between Mogura and us. You should hand them over and let us deal with them accordingly. 

**[Nora]**<br>
*... Those two? I figure it's about time we start sorting things out as well. *

**Diego**<br>
Since that's the way it is, I'll be blunt. You know very well that to the Baro brotherhood... no, to this three\-way alliance, those two are our common enemy. Yet you hid and sheltered them behind our backs. May I ask what is all this about?

**[Nora]**<br>
*I said this last time as well. I have no interest in your self\-proclaimed alliance. These two are currently guests of Kyuu Hou Kai. It has nothing to do at all with you or Mogura.*

**Diego**<br>
Hoho, you think such an excuse will work. I think this is all planned by you. Telling them to disrupt the transaction was part of your plans, wasn't it? Yet you're still able to pretend like you don't care at all... I've got to hand it to you.

**[Nora]**<br>
*Diego, you are many things, but a good actor you are not.<br>
You and I both know what the truth really is. The reason why you want them so badly isn't just because they interfered with that little weapons deal, am I right? Oh, and when I said "sort things out", I'm talking about the stuff you guys did.*

**Diego**<br>
... What do you mean?

*\[Plays Audio\]*

**[Diego]**<br>
*... I already have a perfect plan in place. First, we'll start with the Kyubo Medical Center that's irrelevant to us. All that's required is for you to nod your head...*

**Diego**<br>
......

**Angus**<br>
Is this... a recording of the last meeting? We've been played...

**Diego**<br>
Ha...HAHA! Well\-done. Brilliant! You're indeed the "All\-knowing Eye". Everything is under your control... Is that what you think?

**[Nora]**<br>
*This is ironclad proof that you two organizations see us as an enemy. Do not expect Kyuu Hou Kai to treat you people kindly in the future.*

**Diego**<br>
…… Hehe. That's right. The one who attacked the Kyubo Medical Center was indeed us. I also received news that the mysterious beings who obstructed our operation were those two as well. You said so yourself, that Sherry Pauline counts as someone from 08's system. Therefore, you should hand her over for us to deal with. You don't want this to get bloody either, do you?

**[Nora]**<br>
*Diego, I understand that you have no fear of anything. You and the underlings of Ryu are just like the filth of this city; persistent and never\-ending. Therefore, you think the few elites that make up Kyuu Hou Kai are absolutely no match for you.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*... But let me tell you; you're very, very wrong.*

*\[Parts moving\]*

**Angus**<br>
!?

**[Nora]**<br>
*As you can see, Kyuu Hou Kai has long become a "fortress". Its automatic defense system is far superior to those worthless thugs you have surrounded yourself with. If necessary, I will activate all security systems in this entire city. Even if Ryu showed up with the entire force of the Administration Bureau, they will be no match for Kyuu Hou Kai.*

**[Nora]**<br>
*This will be the final warning. Leave, now*

**Angus**<br>
... Boss, if we make a move now...

**Diego**<br>
… Seems like we underestimated the enemy. Let's go. <br>
Nora, this is far from over... You will see it, even if you don't have the "Eyes" anymore.

**[Nora]**<br>
*Goodbye.*

**Diego**<br>
Ah, yes! Please relay to those two that I'll take good care of their families!

*\[Engine Starts\]*

*[→Signal Switches]*

**[Nora]**<br>
*... Miss Pauline?*

**Cherry**<br>
......

**[Nora]**<br>
*Guests are prohibited from entering this area. Please return to your room.*

**Cherry**<br>
... I'm sorry, Nora. It's because of us that...

**[Nora]**<br>
*Diego's real target is Kyuu Hou Kai's resources. It's all for the goal of having a massive profit to surpass that of Mogura's. Both you and Mr. Jackson are merely excuses. You are in no way responsible.*

**Cherry**<br>
... I see...

**[Nora]**<br>
*I have connections in 08. Nothing will happen to your families. Kyuu Hou Kai owes you two a debt of gratitude for what you've done. I won't let these pointless power struggles disturb you.*

**Cherry**<br>
……<br>
Understood...... Thank you.

*[Signal Lost]*
