The new EP is really, really good! NEKO made a remix for it too! Ah, but I'm still not done making it!

**Cherry**<br>
Really? Thank you...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Oh! By the way, did you guys have a performance at 054 a few days ago? NEKO really wanted to go!!! But I was still locked in the bureau...

**Cherry**<br>
Haha... I have a holographic recreation of the entire performance. How about I send it to you later?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
EHH!? Really? That's awesome!!<br>
Ah, also, last time on iM...

**Xenon**<br>
... Hey, didn't you want to know what happened?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Oh, right! I got too carried away and completely forgot about it. Teehee\~

**Xenon**<br>
Teehee my ass... I'll give you a brief explanation: In short, during your stream on cyTus, you were hacked by Æsir. The audiences who were connected to the same block, including yourself, suffer an attack identical to the Æsir \- FEST incident. That's why you couldn't remember anything.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
...EH!? You're kidding... so you can actually lose your memory? I thought it was just random B\*\*\*S\*\*\* on the internet...

**Xenon**<br>
Just like when ROBO revealed the footage of the performance, a clear image is all you need to recover your memory. After you get home, stay in your room for a while and you might remember what happened.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
... Scary...

**Xenon**<br>
Since the admins were unable to discover any signs of hacking, you, the no.1 suspect, was marked as an important witness. That's why you were restricted for investigation. Not too hard to understand, right?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Hmm... more or less. But why hack NEKO?

**Xenon**<br>
Don't know the details... but that stream of yours had the highest connection volume since Æsir \- FEST and the PAFF concert...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Hoho!

**Xenon**<br>
... Don't get cocky. I'm guessing that he specifically singles out these kinds of major events with tons of connections for his attacks. Do you realize what this means?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
What?

**Xenon**<br>
Means you have to temporarily stay low on the internet. Your recent statements and actions have been getting way out of hand, you idiot.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
How could you scold me! NEKO only did so to make money! It's not my fault that fans like to see that kind of stuff! As a matter of fact, NEKO's channel is like this because of you as well...

**Xenon**<br>
I know. Letting you become a streamer is one of the very few bad decisions I made in my life... Therefore, I am dealing with it now, aren't I?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
......

**Xenon**<br>
Also, stop using your fans as an excuse to not bear responsibility for your actions on the internet. What are you, a childish brat?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Mmmm...

**Xenon**<br>
All in all, behave yourself on the internet these days, at least until this incident settles down. Otherwise, I have the authority to directly delete your account, you know.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Ummm\~\~ U... understood...<br>
Then what about Sis Cherry's role? What's the deal about her being the reason NEKO was released?

**Cherry**<br>
Please don't add "Sis"... sounds so old.

**Xenon**<br>
... She was a guest performer for Æsir \- FEST. After she remembered some things about Æsir, she provided me some clues to track down this person.<br>
Later, we were able to locate some of his connection equipment. Using the data copied from those pieces of equipment, we were able to prove that you're not the perpetrator of this attack.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Ehhh!? That sounds amazing... it's practically the story of a video game!

**Cherry**<br>
... It's actually not something that fun and dandy. Simon got injured too.

**Xenon**<br>
Hey, don't tell her anything unnecessary.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
EH!? Really? Where? What happened!?

**Xenon**<br>
... No big deal. Just scrapped my arm on the Ruins' walls.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
......

*\[Engine Noise\]*

**Xenon**<br>
The car is here. They will take you back home. Get in the car quickly. You don't want people to catch us three standing together.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Eh? NEKO wants to chat with Sis Cherry some more though\~

**Cherry**<br>
Haha, didn't we exchanged iM? We can chat after you get home. I will send you the performance later.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
OK! That's a promise! Thanks, guys! Bye bye\~

*\[Engine Noise\]*

**Xenon**<br>
See? Pretty unique person, right?

**Cherry**<br>
Whew\~ and here I thought I was the talkative type. I almost couldn't handle her...

**Xenon**<br>
Told you so.

**Cherry**<br>
However, she is indeed a good girl.

**Xenon**<br>
... Perhaps.

**Cherry**<br>
... You really do appear to be like her older brother, just like how you treated Sha...

**Xenon**<br>
I have to go. I need to return to A.R.C. later.

**Cherry**<br>
Eh? Oh, got it. Goodbye...
