**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
All done~ Kenta, time for dinner.

**Yukiko**<br>
Today's dishes look very successful.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
No kidding~ Sis Yukiko is getting more and more skilled by the day. You're so close to surpassing NEKO!

**Kouhei**<br>
I'll get the rice.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Hey! Kenta, big sister said time for dinner! Did you even hear me? Turn off the TV.

**Kenta**<br>
I want to finish this!

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Huh? Isn't that show over?

*\[Music\]*

**Kenta**<br>
I want to finish hearing PAFF's ED!

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Ya little brat...

**Yukiko**<br>
Well~ It doesn't hurt to eat dinner with the TV on sometimes.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Muuu~ Sis Yukiko, you're going to spoil him like this.

**Kouhei**<br>
I wonder who's the one that spoils him more.

**[TV]**<br>
*Good evening, everyone. This is the Evening News.*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Alright, it's all finished. Get in your seat now. No tomatoes today, happy?

**Kenta**<br>
YEAH!

**Yukiko**<br>
Eh......? NEKO, did you make an extra serving again? Why is there so much food?

**Kouhei**<br>
She's right. You seem to do that a lot these days.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Ah... NEKO gets hungry in the middle of the night, so I figure the extra portion can serve as a late\-night meal!

**Kouhei**<br>
... You better watch your weight.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Ha!? NEKO is not fat at all, OK! I'm just not tall enough! Daddy, you don't get to talk! If you keep drinking beer, that beer belly is going to get more and more noticeable!

**Yukiko**<br>
Hoho, she has a point. You should pay more attention to yourself too.

**Kouhei**<br>
Ummm...

**[TV]**<br>
*The next news: <br>
The super idol PAFF, who went missing a while ago, is still yet to be found by the Administration Bureau. Because of this, some fans have begun to form voluntary search squads. As of now, the scale of this search by the civilians is growing larger and larger. Multiple stores have begun to report this search on being a hindrance to their businesses...*

**Yukiko**<br>
It seems rare for Node 08 to have a person go missing for so long. It's so scary...

**Kouhei**<br>
That's just because you've never heard about those who were never found. That simply can't be the case with PAFF. She's way too famous.

**Yukiko**<br>
However, if she escapes to another Node... for example, somewhere like 03, it will be very difficult to find her.

**Kenta**<br>
Is PAFF not coming back again...?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
......

**Kouhei**<br>
NEKO, why are you so quiet today? Usually, whenever we see news about PAFF, don't you always badmouth her for like a minute?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
EH!? Eh... Ah, yeah, haha...<br>
Well, I guess it is pretty tough to be a superstar...

**Kouhei**<br>
... What is wrong with you today?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Nothing! I'm just a bit exhausted from the supplementary classes at the Academy this afternoon. Teehee~

**Kouhei**<br>
You're graduating in two months. Keep at it.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Yep.

**Kouhei**<br>
Sidenote, these days, whenever you're not at home, there are noises coming from your room. You aren't raising something in secret again, are you?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Eh!? N, no I did not!

**Kouhei**<br>
NEKO, we respect you, that's why we won't check your room. To be honest, you have the freedom to have any pet, but please don't get cats anymore...

**Yukiko**<br>
Sorry. I really couldn't handle cats...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
... Of course I won't! Sis Yukiko is not having allergies as well, right? I really don't have anything!

**Kouhei**<br>
... If something happened, tell us. We will all help you out, get it?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
.....<br>
I, I know that. What? Why are you saying this out of nowhere? Ahahaha...

*[→Signal Switch]*

*\[Door Closes\]*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Whew~<br>
Here, your dinner.

**PAFF**<br>
Thank you... Is something wrong?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
They said that they heard noises from the room in the morning...

**PAFF**<br>
Ah, I accidentally fell down this morning...... I'm so sorry!

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Come on~ Be careful, ok! NEKO feel like I can't cover this up anymore...

**PAFF**<br>
I get it... sorry.
