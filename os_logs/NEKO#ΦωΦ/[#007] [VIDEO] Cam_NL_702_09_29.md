**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Hah\~ That feels nice\~<br>
Here, this is for you. You're sick, right? You should take this medicine.

**PAFF**<br>
......

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
... What's the matter? You can't take flu medicine? Ah! Or are you suspecting that NEKO just gave you some weird drug?

**PAFF**<br>
N, no. I just didn't expect you to be willing to help me. Thank you so much...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
A super idol suddenly pops up on your doorsteps like a beggar and is bawling her eyes out; pretty sure most people would not just ignore her.

**PAFF**<br>
......

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
And turns out you can speak normally after all.

**PAFF**<br>
Eh? Umm...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Ah, nothing. It's just that I've never heard you speak back when I was still with Mono.

**PAFF**<br>
... I'm sorry.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Umm, you don't have to apologize... Heard rumors that you ran away from Mono. Looks like it's confirmed now?

**PAFF**<br>
Yes...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
What happened?

**PAFF**<br>
I... I don't where I should begin. My brain is still a mess right now...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Oh my... Then, let's start by telling me why you decided to come to NEKO.

**PAFF**<br>
... Besides the people at Mono, I don't know anybody else...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Wait a sec, how did you know where NEKO lives?

**PAFF**<br>
I just found out today that Tuner\-san has Mono's address book stored in it...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Damnit! Those bastards at Mono still kept my information after all these years... Whatever; now's not the time to be annoyed by that. <br>
You said today? Then where have you been before I took you in?

**PAFF**<br>
On the streets...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
On the streets...? For how long?

**PAFF**<br>
Two weeks... I think?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Two Weeks!? Did you not find a place to stay?

**PAFF**<br>
Yes... It seems that I'm easily recognizable, so I'm too scared to go anywhere...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Idiot! No wonder you looked like a beggar! If NEKO was not released by the admins, wouldn't you be wandering the streets with no end!?

**PAFF**<br>
...... But I have nowhere to go, and I don't know who I can go to for help...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
... NEKO used to believe that you were protected like a princess by them. Didn't think that you would do something as daring as running away. You definitely caught me by surprise there.

**PAFF**<br>
Protect...?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Right? Back then, it's difficult to even come near you. You were always accompanied by your sister and a ton of security people.

**PAFF**<br>
Sister... *\*Sobs\**...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Ehhh? Why are you crying again...

**PAFF**<br>
*\*Sobs\**... I'm sorry.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Forget it. You were finally able to find a place to settle down. Bet you still need time to organize your thoughts, right? NEKO will spare you the questions.<br>
All in all, you can stay here tonight! Get some rest; you can take your time and tell me what happened tomorrow.

**PAFF**<br>
... Is it really ok? Your family...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
No worries\~ They basically never come into my room. Previously, I kept a stray cat in my room without their knowledge for almost a month! It's a much bigger stray cat this time though, Haha\~.

**PAFF**<br>
...Haha.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Hoho\~? This is the first I ever see you smile; it's cute! An idol should be more like this, so stop crying.

**PAFF**<br>
I, is that so...?

*\[Door Opens\]*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Ah, they're back. Make sure you hide yourself carefully. My little brother is a HUGE\~ fan of yours. If he finds out you're hiding here, he's gonna cause a big ruckus!
