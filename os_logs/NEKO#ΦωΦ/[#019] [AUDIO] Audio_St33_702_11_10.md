**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Linda\-chan! Thank you so much back there!

**[Linda]**<br>
*Happen to visit the instrument store for a restock, just to catch you wandering around the streets with her. Are you really okay?*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
I thought having a disguise will be enough. Looks like PAFF's popularity is the equivalent of more than ten NEKOs combined...

**[Linda]**<br>
*Of course she is! Like that new employee you just met back at the shop; he's a super hardcore cream Puff. Good thing that I was right behind you guys.*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
No kidding! Linda\-chan, you're my hero!

**[Linda]**<br>
*Yeah yeah. Keep up the hard work. <br>
If there's anything you need help with, just let me know. Be more careful though. Recently, a lot of folks at UV have been chatting about the search for PAFF too.*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Okay. NEKO understands that. Bye.

*[Call Ends]*

**PAFF**<br>
Did I trouble your friend...?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Not at all\~ Everything is a\-okay!

**PAFF**<br>
Good to hear that.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
She's the friend I previously mentioned to you; the one who knows a lot about hairstyles\~ Man, I want to introduce you guys to each other so bad\~ You two will absolutely become good friends!

**PAFF**<br>
Friend...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
We're here. Do you remember anything about this place?

**PAFF**<br>
Hmm... I have to think about it...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
What's the matter? You don't look so well.

**PAFF**<br>
I feel a bit lightheaded...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Are you alright!? Maybe we should go home first?

**PAFF**<br>
No. We've gotten all the way here. I'll try a bit harder.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
......

**PAFF**<br>
I... I remember now! It's this one! Yes, this white door.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Really!? Then NEKO will ring the doorbell, kay?<br>
Aroma\-chan, you should probably hide.<br>
Don't want you to get recognized again.

**PAFF**<br>
Okay!

*\[Doorbell\]*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
......

**PAFF**<br>
......

**Jerry**<br>
Coming.

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Jerry**<br>
... Who the heck are you?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Ah... Hello, mister. Umm... Is this the home of Iris Bagel?

**PAFF**<br>
It's Baker...

**Jerry**<br>
Huh? Again? No, it's not!

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
EHHH?

**Jerry**<br>
If you don't have anything else, bug off.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Eh, wait! You just said "again"?

**Jerry**<br>
Somebody just came to ask the same thing a few days ago and was really damn persistent about it too. Do you reporters have too much time to throw away?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Reporter...

**Jerry**<br>
All in all, you girls have the wrong location.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Mister... please! NEKO is not a reporter. Iris... is a very important friend. \*Sobs\*...

**Jerry**<br>
... Hey...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
NEKO... just wants to find her... Please, mister, tell NEKO what you know. Anything, anything little thing will do... \*Sobs\*...

**Jerry**<br>
... S, so cute...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
... *\*Sobs\**... *\*More sobs\**...

**Jerry**<br>
... A, alright. I'll tell you, so stop crying! Baker, is it? They're the previous owner of this house. They moved away a long time ago.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Eh...? Where did they move to?

**Jerry**<br>
... I think they moved to Node 19. A place that's pretty far away.

**PAFF**<br>
......

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
How come...

**Jerry**<br>
That's enough, right? That's really all I know...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Ah, okay. Thank you...

*\[Door Closes\]*

**PAFF**<br>
NEKO... Don't cry.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Ha? Of course it's fake! Hehe, I'm amazing, aren't I? One twitch of the eye and tears just come gushing out!

**PAFF**<br>
Eh... Haha.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Nevertheless, what should we do now? He said that they moved to Node 19... With our current circumstances, it's very unlikely that we get to leave the Node.

**PAFF**<br>
Yeah...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
So, we can only give up for now...?<br>
Aroma\-chan, are there other classmates we can seek out?

**PAFF**<br>
I still remember Daniel and Clara, but I don't know where they are now either...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
That's okay! At least we still have hope. Let's fight together! NEKO will absolutely help you figure out what exactly happened to you!

**PAFF**<br>
NEKO... Thank you.
