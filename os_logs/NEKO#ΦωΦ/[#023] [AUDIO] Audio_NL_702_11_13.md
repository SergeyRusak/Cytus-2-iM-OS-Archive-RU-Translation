**PAFF**<br>
Uggghhh...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
... Aroma\-chan?

**PAFF**<br>
Ugh...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
You... can't fall asleep?

*\[Turns On Light\]*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Awawawa! Your nose is bleeding! What's the matter!? Hey, wake up!

**PAFF**<br>
...... Eh?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Quick, hold down with it! Are you alright? Are you not feeling well!?

**PAFF**<br>
No... I just... had a dream... I think?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
... A dream?

**PAFF**<br>
... No, it's not a dream... It's too real to be one.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Ehh~ Did you recover a new piece of memory?

**PAFF**<br>
I don't know... I saw Clara...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Clara? Ah, the classmate Aroma is looking for. Did you just remember something from your student days?

**PAFF**<br>
No, I'm not present in the memory... but it was a conversation about me, and it also mentioned that Iris moved away not long after graduation...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Ehhh... If we knew that sooner, we wouldn't have to take that extra trip~

**PAFF**<br>
I'm sorry...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Ah, I don't mean to blame Aroma\-chan! It's hard to predict this type of thing anyway!<br>
Here, wipe your tears.

**PAFF**<br>
Yes... thank you.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
.. Are there any hints in the memory just now? Something related to that Clara. Ah, if you're still not feeling well, don't bother. No need to force yourself. 

**PAFF**<br>
Umm... This... it's a bit... blurry... Clara went to Daniel's home to wait for him...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Daniel's home? What does it look like?

**PAFF**<br>
A very normal building. Nothing special...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Huh...

**PAFF**<br>
Ah, now I remember... That place doesn't seem to be inside Tower. There also aren't any really tall buildings nearby, because I can still see the sky.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Wait, stop right there! Buzzer time! NEKO knows this one!

**PAFF**<br>
Eh?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
That should be the "Midwest Town Area" of Node 08. If we're talking about places on the surface that have skies not yet covered by buildings, that should be the only area left...<br>
Meowbot, search images of "Midwest Town Area"!

**[Meowbot]**<br>
*Search complete meow! Meowbot found lots of results meow!*

*\[Projection\]*

**PAFF**<br>
Ah... it does look very similar. This should be the area!

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Teehee, NEKO's amazing, isn't it~<br>
When we first moved here, we were originally gonna live there, because the rent is very cheap... But daddy said that it's more convenient if the house is closer to the Academy.

**PAFF**<br>
NEKO really has a good father.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
He's just a stupid Smelly Feet.<br>
Okey\-doke, our next step is to go to that area and look around. Aroma\-chan, you better recognize which building that Daniel's house is.

**PAFF**<br>
U, understood. I can probably do it...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Have some confidence! Aroma\-chan is so smart, you can do it!

**PAFF**<br>
... Haha. Okay, I will do it.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Then let's sleep now. G\-night!

**PAFF**<br>
Yes... Goodnight.

*\[Turns Off Light\]*

**PAFF**<br>
But... Why did I...

*[Signal Lost]*
