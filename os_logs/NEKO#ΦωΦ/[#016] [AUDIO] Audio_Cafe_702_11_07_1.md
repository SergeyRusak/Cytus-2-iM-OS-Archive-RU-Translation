**Linda**<br>
Hmm... I feel like a bit more Absinthe is probably better.

**JOE**<br>
Oh? You know your booze well.

**Linda**<br>
Nah, just a bit. I learned them when I worked at the bar in Under Velvet.

**JOE**<br>
Ho? So you work there? I used to perform there a lot.<br>
I thought that since you're a girl, it's better if I tone down the bitterness.

**Linda**<br>
Haha, it ain't "Queen Kill" if it's not bitter.

**JOE**<br>
Very well. I'll make a new one for you. This one is on me.

**Linda**<br>
Thank you.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
NEKO! On stage!

**JOE**<br>
Girl, be nice to the door! Are you trying to tear down my poor little shop!?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Linda\-chan\~ Gimme a hug!

**Linda**<br>
Yikes! Be careful; I have a drink in my hand.

**JOE**<br>
Oh? So you two know each other?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Yep! NEKO is meeting up with her here. You didn't get harassed by uncle JOE, did you?

**JOE**<br>
I'm not that... who you calling uncle?<br>
Why are you so weirdly excited today? Are you drunk already?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Of course I'm not\~ Alcohol tastes awful!

**Linda**<br>
She's just like this all the time.

**JOE**<br>
Yeah, I get it. What do you want to drink?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Woah\~ What is Linda\-chan having? It looks so pretty! NEKO wants one as well!

**Linda**<br>
It's "Queen Kill", but this is an alcoholic beverage.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Then NEKO wants a "Queen Kill" with no alcohol!

**JOE**<br>
No alcohol... Isn't that just apple juice? Alright, gimme a minute.

**Linda**<br>
So, internet superstar, why do you have the spare time to ask me out for a drink today?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Hmmm... I just miss you very much all of a sudden!

**Linda**<br>
......?<br>
What's the matter with you?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
... To be honest... There's something I want to discuss with you, and uncle JOE too...

**JOE**<br>
Ho? What's wrong? You seem pretty serious all of a sudden. Geez, now I'm getting nervous.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Yeah... Because it really is something very serious. NEKO has no idea who I should discuss this with...

**Linda**<br>
... I've been listening to you complain about everything for years, yet this is the first time I see you with this face. What exactly is this "serious" thing?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Umm... Let NEKO organize myself a bit...
