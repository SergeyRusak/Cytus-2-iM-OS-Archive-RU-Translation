**[Daniel]**<br>
*Who is it?*

**Vicky**<br>
Are you Mr. Daniel Evans?

**[Daniel]**<br>
*Yes. And you are?*

**Vicky**<br>
I am Vicky, a reporter from 08 Daily. This is my assistant. Here's our press passes.<br>
We are currently doing a report on PAFF. We heard that you were her classmate when she studied at the Academy. We would like to ask you some questions. Could you spare us a few minutes?

**[Daniel]**<br>
*......<br>
I'm afraid there's nothing I can tell you people.*

**Vicky**<br>
Then...

**[Daniel]**<br>
*Please leave.*

**Vicky**<br>
Hey! Wai...

**Hayato**<br>
Mr. Evans! To be frank, we are currently investigating the whereabouts of the missing PAFF. And we are already very close to the truth.

**[Daniel]**<br>
*......!*

**Vicky**<br>
Hayato!

**Hayato**<br>
Sis Vicky, let me handle this.

**Hayato**<br>
To be honest, we think that PAFF... Aroma's missing is deeply connected to her lost memories in the past. There may be some hidden information among all this. If she is caught up in something terrible, we will absolutely try our best to find out what it is. Please, lend us a hand!

**[Daniel]**<br>
*……*

**[Daniel]**<br>
*I've opened the door. You can take the left elevator to come upstairs.*

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Vicky**<br>
......!

**Vicky**<br>
Hey, not bad at all! I didn't know you had this in you.

**Hayato**<br>
......
