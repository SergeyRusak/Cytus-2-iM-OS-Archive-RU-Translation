**Kenta**<br>
Ah, Big brother Xenon!

**Xenon**<br>
Kenta, long time no see. I'm here to see your sister.

**Kenta**<br>
Big sister is in her room.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Eh? Why are you here so fast? NEKO is not done cleaning her room yet!

**Xenon**<br>
No need for that. I know perfectly well that your room resembles a dumpster. It's not like I haven't seen it before.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
No, Nein, Non! You can only come in AFTER I'm done cleaning!

**Xenon**<br>
... What in the world is she up to?

**Kenta**<br>
Don't know. Big sister has been acting really weird lately.

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

**Xenon**<br>
So this is where you stream?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Uh\-huh. Once I returned to my room, I remember what happened on the stream!

**Xenon**<br>
As I expected...

**[Xenon-A.I.]**<br>
*Rewind Starts*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Ohhhhhh! What is that!? It's so freaking cool!!

**Xenon**<br>
My A.I. It can rewind and trace the signal source through the connection routes. The admins have now filed an official request to A.R.C. to investigation Æsir himself.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Rewind...? Don't get it! How does it work!?

**Xenon**<br>
You're noisy. Cherry also saw this, ask her instead. I don't have the time to explain the details to you.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Muuuu\~\~

**Xenon**<br>
Speaking of which, do you know about her getting injured?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Of course I do! NEKO called her a while ago; she said nothing is serious...

*\[Knock on the head\]*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Oww! That hurts! Why did you hit me!?

**Xenon**<br>
What were you thinking with that stream a few days ago? Didn't I tell you to stay low when I got you out? Yet you started spilling random crap immediately... do you really want me to delete your account?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
T, that... that was just a quick chat with everyone whom I haven't seen in a while!

**Xenon**<br>
Do you realize that many people rushed to Mono because of what you said? And that they made the site even more chaotic? Cherry got hurt because of that, too.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Eh...? What... how did it...?

**Xenon**<br>
Your fans are simply too out of control... To be honest, even if we suspend your account now, it will very likely lead to other issues.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
...... T, that's true! You can't blame NEKO for all that!

**Xenon**<br>
Shut up. It's because of the current situation that you need to pay even more attention to what you post. Now, only you can prevent them from blowing this thing even more out of proportion.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Umm... OK\~ But didn't I tell them to not make random guesses afterward? And I ended the stream too?

**Xenon**<br>
Not enough. You started the topic, didn't you?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Once I got online, everyone just wanted to talk about gossip. If I don't talk about this, it feels like the channel will become kinda boring...

**Xenon**<br>
... They are your fans after all. All these years of you feeding them content like that... <br>
No, that's not it. They're probably already like that in the first place; your channel just drew them together into one massive group...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Heehee, so they are all attracted by NEKO's charm? Nice!

**Xenon**<br>
... Idiot. All in all, you must have a better understanding of the influences and dangers of the internet. You are already a public figure. Try to avoid creating more chaos, get it? Don't give me more work.<br>
If your channel is solely dependent on gossip, then that's quite sad.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
... Ok, ok, I get it! Xenon is so annoying in lecture mode!

**[Xenon-A.I.]**<br>
*Rewind complete. Communication records that match criteria: 1. *

**Xenon**<br>
Done...huh? What is this? This is a really weird location.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
What's wrong?

**Xenon**<br>
Nothing. I'll analyze it in detail when I get back.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Eh? Are you leaving?

**Xenon**<br>
Yes, my schedule is quite packed. The only reason I came was for the rewind... Ah, and to get JOE's Bass, since you really aren't practicing much.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
EH!? I am! I will practice! Don't take it away!

**Xenon**<br>
Shut it. I had a bet with him. If I don't take it back to him this time, he will get me trashed for sure. I'm taking it.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Eheh\~\~\~!
