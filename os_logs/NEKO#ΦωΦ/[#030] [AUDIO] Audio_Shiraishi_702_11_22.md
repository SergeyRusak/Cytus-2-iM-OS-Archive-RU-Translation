Mommy! Grandma! NEKO is back!

**Saku**<br>
Welcome back. You've grown bigger again. Those two behind you, they must be the friends you mentioned, right?

**Hayato**<br>
Umm, h\-hello...

**PAFF**<br>
Hello, Mrs. Shiraishi! Sorry for disturbing you. Thank you for willing to let us stay here for a night.

**Mayu**<br>
Not at all. We're the ones who should thank you. Thank you two for taking care of NEKO all this time.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Eh!? They did not! Grandma, don't make things up!

**PAFF**<br>
That's right. We're the ones who NEKO has taken care of instead. We owe her a lot.

**Mayu**<br>
Is that so? That's surprising...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
GRAND\~ MA\~!!

**Saku**<br>
Haha... Come one in, don't just stand there. Bring your bags inside. Apologies for the small room, but I can ensure you that it is regularly cleaned. If there's any inconvenience, feel free to tell us.

**PAFF**<br>
Thank you, Mrs. Shiraishi!<br>
The room really is very clean. This used to be NEKO's old room, right?

**Hayato**<br>
Ah... is it really okay for us to live here?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Teehee\~ No problem at all! I'm sleeping with mommy tonight! Although not being able to cuddle Aroma\-chan kinda sucks...

**Saku**<br>
Haha, for a child your age, you really are clingy...<br>
Oh no, I forgot that I need to prepare another set of blankets for you guys...

**Mayu**<br>
Let me do that, Saku. He\-ya...

**Saku**<br>
Mom? Is your back alright?

**Mayu**<br>
It's fine. I'm feeling pretty good today. About time I do a little exercise too.

**PAFF**<br>
Thank you so much\~ Let us help out too!

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Saku**<br>
... NEKO, so the female friend you mentioned on the phone is PAFF, the idol you used to talk about a lot? There has been a lot of news about you and her.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Oh, yeah... Sorry, mommy. Her story is a bit... complicated. NEKO doesn't really know how to explain it clearly...

**Saku**<br>
It's alright. Miss PAFF seems to be a good girl, and she's very poised too.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Yeah, she is... To be honest, she was previously really shy and introverted. She was nothing like who she is now.

**Saku**<br>
Eh? What do you mean?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Umm... That's also kinda hard to explain. Forget it, no big deal. Ahahahaha!

**Saku**<br>
... NEKO, whenever you're trying to hide something, you'll always start to laugh really nervously like that. It's been a habit of yours since you were a very small child.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Teehee, hehehe... I knew I couldn't fool mommy.

**Saku**<br>
Of course you couldn't. So, tell me.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
When PAFF... Aroma\-chan first came to NEKO, she was exactly the same as the rumors described: a scaredy\-cat and really, really shy! Although I found it quite annoying, I also found it to be very cute. That's the Aroma\-chan NEKO knew as well. <br>
Right now, she... it's as if she has become an unfamiliar person. NEKO doesn't quite know how to talk to her.

**Saku**<br>
I see... However, she is still NEKO's friend, right?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Of course she is! She still remembers everything about the time she spent together with NEKO! It's just that the way she talks now is a bit... cool?<br>
In short, I'm not quite used to it yet, ahahaha. It's no big deal, actually! Aroma\-chan is still NEKO's friend, that much is for sure!

**Saku**<br>
Hmmm... Even though I don't know how much help it'll be, we'll let them stay here for now. They can stay until Miss PAFF resolves everything.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
EHHH!? You're going to let them stay here until then?

**Saku**<br>
Yes. Since Miss PAFF is NEKO's friend, mommy trusts her as well. If NEKO wants to help her, it's only natural that mommy helps her to the very end as well.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
*\*Sobs\**\~ You're the best mommy in the world...

**Saku**<br>
However, mommy needs to remind you, do not get yourself involved in anything dangerous, understand?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Understood! NEKO will not disappoint you!

**Saku**<br>
Haha... Come, let's go help your grandma out, shall we?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Yes!
