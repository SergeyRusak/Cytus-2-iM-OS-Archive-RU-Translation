**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Lin\~da\~chan\~! Welcome!

**Linda**<br>
Sorry for disturbing... Yikes! NEKO...

**Kouhei**<br>
NEKO, that's dangerous. Don't do that.<br>
Linda, it has been a while.

**Linda**<br>
Yes. I'll be in your care tonight.

**Yukiko**<br>
Hello, Linda. NEKO mentions you a lot in our conversations! I finally get to meet you in person.

**Linda**<br>
Thank you for the invitation... You're... Sis Yukiko, right?

**Yukiko**<br>
Yes. Thank you for taking care of NEKO a while ago. Also, apologies for causing you so much trouble...<br>
Here, come on in. We've prepared a Christmas feast!

**Linda**<br>
Not at all...... Thank you.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
What do you think!? A very kind person, right!

**Linda**<br>
Yeah, totally different than you. Let's get inside first.

*[»»» Fast Forward 30 minutes»»»]*

**Kenta**<br>
Mom! I'm full! I want to play video games!

**Yukiko**<br>
Sure. Go ahead.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Hold your horses! Get your a\*\* back here! You left tomatoes on your plate again! And green peppers! No video games for you until you finish them!

**Yukiko**<br>
It's alright; he already ate a lot... Linda, how is the food? Do you like it?

**Linda**<br>
Ah, it's very tasty! I don't usually have meals this grand back at home. Thank you.

**Yukiko**<br>
Thank goodness. I was really anxious about messing up the dishes... especially the roast chicken. In my hometown, we didn't normally eat this during Christmas.

**Linda**<br>
Do people not celebrate Christmas back in Node 03?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
We do, but we don't go as far as roasting a whole chicken for it.<br>
Speaking of which, the holiday celebrations in Node 08 are nuts! It seems like there's a huge party for every single holiday... We used to just have a simple meal together and call it a day! Muuu\~ it's not the holiday itself, but who you celebrate the holiday with that's important, right?

**Kouhei**<br>
Haha, material well\-being is very important as well... *\*Gulp!\**

**Linda**<br>
Compare to the next event, Christmas really is nothing special. Everybody has more or less gotten used to celebrating it.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
The next event?

**Linda**<br>
In a few days, it would be new year's eve for 700 N.A. Rumor has it that the admins plan to create the most glorious celebration event ever. There will be a giant parade, parties, DJ performances and magnificent fireworks! <br>
Oh, and the whole event will be free to attend.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
You're right! The event for last year was super extravagant as well. Since it's the 700th anniversary, it's definitely going to be even more awesome! We should all go to the event, the entire family!

**Kouhei**<br>
Of course... *\*Gulp!\**

**Yukiko**<br>
Linda, will you be going together with us as well? Or are you going with your family?

**Linda**<br>
No... I don't want to bother you guys anymore. Besides, I'm not really good at dealing with crowds. Haha...

**Yukiko**<br>
Now that I think about it, do you girls know what Christmas is celebrating? Both Kenta and I aren't exactly sure about that.

**Linda**<br>
I think the Academy taught us about it, but I already forgot...<br>
NEKO, you... never mind, can't rely on you to remember things.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
What do you say!? NEKO had a higher score than you in the previous history exam\~ you meanie!

**Linda**<br>
I don't think 39 and 42 are scores worthy of any comparison...

**Kouhei**<br>
We old folks don't know either... After all, we learned that humans used to celebrate Christmas from the records. We've never experienced that time ourselves to understand the reasoning... *\*Gulp!\**

**Kouhei**<br>
Nevertheless, even if we don't know what we are celebrating, the fact that we can gather together and enjoy a hearty meal is already more than enough to be happy about... Isn't that all we want, to be happy?<br>
It doesn't matter if we never truly understand it. Hahaha.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
......

**Kouhei**<br>
That is why, daddy needs to learn from you guys too... Stuff like dying your hair or wearing those ripped clothes... Sighs, I can never figure what young people are up to these days. Daddy was not like this when I was young...... *\*Gulp!\**

**Linda**<br>
Umm...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Daddy, you idiot, why are you talking about this again all of a sudden...

**Kouhei**<br>
... Even though I don't understand, daddy at least knows that is why you guys like. That's good enough for me.<br>
Daddy believes, that the things my daughter likes are definitely not bad.

**Yukiko**<br>
......?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
... Daddy, are you...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
AHH!! I knew it! The thing you've been chugging down all this time, it's wine, isn't it!?

**Yukiko**<br>
Eh? I'm sure I hid the bottle... Kouhei, you said you were just drinking one glass. Come on...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Sis Yukiko, look at this! It's hidden behind his legs! The whole bottle is empty! You're way too naive! Once daddy flips the switch there is no stopping him okay!

**Kouhei**<br>
Not a problem, NEKO, daddy is not drunk... Daddy wants your best friend to teach me, what you young people are into these days... Hick! You two have known each other for so long...

**Linda**<br>
......

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
No harassing Linda\-chan\~!<br>
Sis Yukiko, we need to drag this drunkard away and lay him in bed now! This fatso will directly collapse into a deep sleep any minute now and won't wake up until tomorrow morning. We won't be able to move him once he is asleep! Hurry, hurry!

**Yukiko**<br>
Umm, O, okay! Kouhei, come over here...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Arrggghhhh\~ This is so embarrassing\~ Dumb daddy! Stupid smelly feet!
