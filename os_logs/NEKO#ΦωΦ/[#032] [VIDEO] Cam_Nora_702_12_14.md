*Threat invasion detected in area 03, engaging full fortification in three minutes.  Security personnel, please proceed to your battle stations.*

**Kyuu Hou Kai Member**<br>
Everyone, please move in this direction.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Don't push NEKO!<br>
W\-w\-w\-w\-what is going on! Nora\-chan!?

**[Nora]**<br>
*Apologies. The facility is under attack. Before we can resolve this situation, we would like fellow guests to hide here for now.*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
EH!? What attack? Is it dangerous!?

**[Nora]**<br>
*Daigo, the screen.<br>
... It appears that the tunnels in area 03 have already been completely broken through.*

**Member D**<br>
Damnit, how on earth did they find that entrance!? Security team A, team B, report to area 03 immediately!

**Xenon**<br>
...... Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

**Cherry**<br>
... Uh\-huh. The problem now is, how are we gonna open this door?

**PAFF**<br>
Don't tell me, you guys are going... Is that really a good idea?

**Hayato**<br>
Right! We should do what Nora told us and hide here. It's safer that way, isn't it?

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

*\[Parts moving\]*

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*This unit, join as well.*

**Cherry**<br>
A gun...?<br>
You sure about this?

**[ROBO_Head]**<br>
*Protect Nora, protect everyone.*

**Cherry**<br>
Gotcha. Then you'll act according to my commands. We help Simon create an opportunity, he'll get rid of those drones, just like how we did it back at the Kyubo Medical Center, correct?

**Xenon**<br>
If we're lucky.<br>
You three, stay here. Hayato, watch the door closely.

*\[Door Closes\]*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Xenon!

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

*\[Explosion\]*

**PAFF**<br>
It's still going on...

**Hayato**<br>
Don't worry, Kaori... The sounds have been coming from a distance away. Looks like the defenses weren't cracked. Let's have faith in them.

**PAFF**<br>
But...

*\[Gunshot\]*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
*\*Sniff\*... \*Sobs\*...*

**PAFF**<br>
NEKO?

*\[Hugs\]*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
*\*Bawls\**

**Hayato**<br>
W, what happened!?

**PAFF**<br>
NEKO... Are you scared?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
O\-of course I'm scared! T\-this is w\-w\-w\-war! A real war! NEKO never ever thought that I would encounter something like this! And right after I promised mommy that I wouldn't get myself involved in anything dangerous too!

**PAFF**<br>
I'm sorry for getting you caught up in all this... It's all my fault.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
It's not Aroma\-chan's fault!

**PAFF**<br>
NEKO...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
NEKO said she would help Aroma\-chan, so NEKO will help to the very end! It's all the bad guys' fault! NEKO is so worried about the others... especially Nora\-chan. She's so weak and fragile, yet she is out there fighting those bad guys for us... while all we can do is hide here...

**PAFF**<br>
......

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Same with Uncle Daigo, and Sis Cherry, and X\-X\-Xenon... They're all out there, despite this being a war, despite this being so terrifying...<br>
If anything is to happen to them...

*\[Explosion\]*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Eek...!

*\[Hugs\]*

**PAFF**<br>
No need to be afraid. We're all here.

**Hayato**<br>
... Damnit... I want to help too, anything would do...

*\[Explosion\]*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
NEKO... is someone that can't do anything either...

*[Signal Lost]*
