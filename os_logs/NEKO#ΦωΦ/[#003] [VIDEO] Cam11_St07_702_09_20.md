Yeepee~ I'm home, I'm home!<br>
Say~ that was one heck of an uncomfortable ride, wasn't it? Can't you guys get a better car? NEKO was wrongly accused; shouldn't I be treated better!?

*\[Engine Sounds\]*

**Agent**<br>
... Get out the car.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Fine... Thanks, guys... Blehhh~!

**Yukiko**<br>
Coming!

**Kouhei**<br>
NEKO!

**[MeowBot]**<br>
*Welcome Back!*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Daddy! Everyone! Haha, you guys even brought out the MeowBot! Quite the crowd you got there!

**Kenta**<br>
Big sister! You're back!

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Kenta! Have you been a good boy?

**Kenta**<br>
Big sister is the one who's not good! You got put in jail!

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
I, I did not! They just want to ask me some questions!

**Yukiko**<br>
Is everything really alright? You are not feeling ill or anything, are you?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
I'm fine, totally fine~ The admins gave me a good room and good food~ Ah! Only one major issue: no internet access at all. I thought I was gonna die of boredom in there!

**Kouhei**<br>
Mr. Xenon has told us about all the details. We can finally rest assured now that you're proven innocent.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Mu~ NEKO would never do something that dangerous, ok!? Let's go home! Stop standing here like a bunch of idiots!

**Yukiko**<br>
OK, we get it~ you must be dead tired, right? Let's go.

*[Signal Switch]*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Tada~ the long\-awaited! NEKO cooking time~~<br>
You guys must all be pretty hungry, right? Let NEKO showcase her skills today!

**[MeowBot]**<br>
*Tada～♪ Tada～♪*

**Kenta**<br>
Yeah!! Can finally taste big sister's delicious cooking!!

**Yukiko**<br>
Can I see this as a complaint about my cooking not tasting good...?

**Kenta**<br>
But big sister's cooking really tastes better than mom's...

**Kouhei**<br>
Hey, aren't you tired?

**Yukiko**<br>
Indeed, you just came back from the bureau. Shouldn't you take a rest? Let me handle it, for today at least...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Silence! All of you, do not get in my way! How dare they mistreat NEKO! NEKO will vent all this anger and frustration on the ingredients! Muhahaha! Where is my knife!?

**[MeowBot]**<br>
*The knife is here. Please use with care!*

**Kenta**<br>
... Looks like we're getting some pretty scary cooking...

**Kouhei**<br>
Don't force yourself.

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

**Kenta**<br>
Thanks for the meal!

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Hey, what is this? Finish everything on your plate before you leave the table!

**Kenta**<br>
No! I hate tomatoes!

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
You little brat... do you want to waste your sister's cooking? It took me a lot of hard work to prepare this, so open your damn mouth!

**Kenta**<br>
HELLLPP! Ah... Ahhhhhhhh~~ Uhh...ark! Ugh...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Good boy! Now go wash your hands~

**Yukiko**<br>
Impressive, During the few days you were not here, he refused to eat any vegetables. That, or he would hold it in his mouth and spit it out in the toilet. What a troublesome child...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Sis Yukiko, sometimes, a little brute force is required to discipline kids. Kids of his age are especially rebellious, so extra measures should be taken~

**Kouhei**<br>
Such big words, even though you've just graduated from your rebellious phrase not that long ago...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Hey! Daddy, didn't we promise not to mention that ancient stuff anymore! NEKO is an adult now!

**Yukiko**<br>
But... it's good to see you still so upbeat. We're all really worried about you...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
... NEKO promised to not let Sis Yukiko and others worry anymore. I am sorry...

**Kouhei**<br>
We were just worried about how the admins were going to treat you. We did not believe for a second that you were the culprit.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
......

**Yukiko**<br>
Mr. Xenon helped you out again this time. We owe him so much at the moment that we have no idea how to thank him.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Nah, no need to thank him. That big nerd, he probably never cared about it in the first place...

**Kouhei**<br>
By the way, what haven't you two start dating each other yet?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
W, what the heck? Daddy, you start to spill nonsense when you get drunk... stupid drunkard!

**Yukiko**<br>
I also think you two would make a really cute couple. *\*Chuckles\**

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Wha... why is Sis Yukiko saying this too~ NEKO is going to go take a shower!
