**JOE**<br>
Here, you calm down yet?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
... Nyan Special! NEKO wants another drink!

**JOE**<br>
You're gonna deplete my inventory for tomorrow's business if you keep drinking! I'm going to charge you starting with this one.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Ehh\~ How could you!? Cheap! S\*\*\*head!

**JOE**<br>
Shut it! Don't act drunk when you haven't even had a sniff of alcohol... No need to be so anxious. Didn't she say in the phone call that she'd be arriving here soon?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
B\-but, Aroma\-chan will get recognized instantly if she's alone on the streets!

**JOE**<br>
Isn't her older sister going to drive her to somewhere nearby? This area isn't exactly populated. Rest assured.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Muuuuu...

**JOE**<br>
Alright, alright... Here, your Special.

**[TV]**<br>
*... Regarding the recent case of Æsir\-FEST incident's prime suspect Simon Jackson escaping from the restricted area, the Administration Bureau held a press conference today. They confirmed that as of now, the suspect is still nowhere to be found...*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Ah...

**JOE**<br>
... You wanna hear about it? The news on Simon.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
X\-Xenon? I do! NEKO wants to hear! Did he escape from jail? Was Uncle the one who helped him?

**JOE**<br>
Yeah. We went into the restricted area and yanked him out. We had a crap ton of Law Enforcement Agents and drones chasing us. It got super scary at times... but I got away just fine. Haha.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Seriously? So he is in the shop right now!?

**JOE**<br>
Ummm... he's not.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Why? Didn't Uncle get him out of there?

**JOE**<br>
There are a lot of reasons... Anyhow, I can ensure that he is safe right now.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Then... Æsir...

**JOE**<br>
Of course it's not him! Someone told me that Simon probably got his memory altered by the real Æsir. That was why he plead guilty... It's just like you.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
So that really was the case...

**JOE**<br>
He has now remembered all of it. Even though his brain was still a bit of a mess, there didn't seem to be any sequelae... You'll be just fine as well.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
NEKO wants to see him!

**JOE**<br>
Unfortunately, you can't. He is still wanted and pursued by the admins. Only by uncovering the truth can he be cleared of the allegations. My friend has already accompanied him to go outside and investigate. You don't need to worry about him.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Outside? Do you mean "outside" outside?

**JOE**<br>
Yeah. He is no longer in Node 08 anymore.<br>
All in all, you'll have to wait a bit longer. Once the publicity dies down, you can meet up with him.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Muuu... NEKO wants to help Xenon out too...

**JOE**<br>
... Keep your voice down. Someone is here.

*\[Doorbell\]*

**PAFF**<br>
Hello...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
...... Aroma\-chan!!!

**PAFF**<br>
Waah!!

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
WAaaaahhhh!! Aroma\-chan, are you alright? Did anyone do anything terrible to you!? You know, umm... that kind of stuff?

**PAFF**<br>
Ummm, I'm alright... what's "that kind of stuff"...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Daddy is so stupid! How can he get drugged like that... NEKO was super worried! WAaaahhh!!

**PAFF**<br>
NEKO... thank you.

**JOE**<br>
Hehe, it really is the super idol herself! Hello\~ I am the owner of JOEZ Cafe. Joe Miller's the name.

**PAFF**<br>
Hello. NEKO mentioned you before... Thank you so much for your help, Mr. Miller.

**JOE**<br>
Haha, no need for that Mister stuff! Just call me JOE. Come, you can get some rest in the basement first. I can swear by Pops' name that this is the safest place available. No one will ever find you here.

**PAFF**<br>
Understood... We'll be in your care.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
NEKO will go down there with you as soon as I finish this drink!
