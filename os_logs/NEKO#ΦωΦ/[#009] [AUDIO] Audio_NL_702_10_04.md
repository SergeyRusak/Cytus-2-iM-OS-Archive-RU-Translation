**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Here, see if these clothes fit you. You can't just wear NEKO's clothes all the time, can you?

**PAFF**<br>
T, thank you...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
And this bra...... HEY\-YA!

**PAFF**<br>
... Kyaa!

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Muuu... Dang, they're big...... Hoho, so soft\~\~\~ Buhehehe...

**PAFF**<br>
Umm... please stop... Pfft, haha...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Hoho\~\~ So PAFF is the type that's weak against tickles...? Take this! Tickle tickle tickle tickle!

**PAFF**<br>
Ahahaha! Ahahaha!

*\[Door Knock\]*

**Kouhei**<br>
NEKO? Who's laughing?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Yikes! Shhh\~!!<br>
N, NEKO is watching a video. What's the matter?

**Yukiko**<br>
We three are going to the mall, and we'll buy ingredients for dinner on the way. Please look after the house. Is there anything you want us to buy for you?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Nothing comes to mind! Have a safe trip\~

*\[Door Opens\]*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Whew... that was close. PAFF, you're too loud! We're this close to being busted!

**PAFF**<br>
I, I'm sorry...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Ah, it's also kinda weird for me to keep calling you PAFF... Can I call you Aroma? Ah! Maybe I'll call you Aroma\-chan instead!

**PAFF**<br>
Eh? Sure...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Then a decision is reached! Aroma\-chan it is!

**PAFF**<br>
Aroma......

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
What's wrong? Still thinking about that incident?

**PAFF**<br>
... It's hard to believe after all, isn't it...? The feeling that I am not myself...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
NEKO doesn't really understand that... However, what do you plan to do next? I'm totally fine with having a cute girl waiting for me everytime I return to my room... but realistically speaking, NEKO can't let you hide here your whole life either.

**PAFF**<br>
I want... to confirm if what I thought was true or not... But about how...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Just a suggestion, isn't directly asking you sister a faster way to know the truth?

**PAFF**<br>
Y, you indeed have a point... but... I'm so scared... I don't know how I should face them...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
......<br>
Well... NEKO can somewhat understand this sort of emotion...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
In short, don't think so much for now! Besides, NEKO hates things that cost too much brain power.<br>
At the very least, letting you hide here for some time as a temporary fix shouldn't be a problem... right?... I think?

**PAFF**<br>
Thank you...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Oh, right! Now they are not at home, come to the bathroom with NEKO.

**PAFF**<br>
Eh?

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Tada! Look, NEKO bought this!

**PAFF**<br>
This is...?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Hair dye! Light slate grey colored\~ Your hair color right now is too noticeable! If we use this and apply some disguise, you should be able to go outside.

**PAFF**<br>
Go outside...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
No need to worry. NEKO is also very well aware of the troubles of being recognized. Therefore, I know a lot about disguises! Besides, we can't have NEKO deliver food to you every day. It's like I have some weird slave fetish or something...<br>
In addition, how will you be able to confirm the things you said if you stay at home all the time?

**PAFF**<br>
Okay...

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Aroma\-chan's hair is so soft... So you had black hair originally?

**PAFF**<br>
Yes, the same color as my sister... I recall that I really liked Magenta, that's why I've always dyed my hair that color.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Huh...? If you ask me, NEKO thinks this color suits you better. Done! Take a look!

**PAFF**<br>
Wow... what a beautiful color!

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Right? NEKO has a friend—— Linda\-chan. She knows a ton about hairstyles! NEKO learned all of my tricks from her!<br>
Then, if we tie your hair like how you used to... tada!

**PAFF**<br>
......!

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
So pretty\~ With that plus a simple face mask, I can guarantee that nobody will recognize it's you. Most importantly, it's adorable\~ I originally plan to cut your hair short, but Aroma\-chan's hair is way too pretty. NEKO can't bring myself to do such a cruel thing!

**PAFF**<br>
T, thank you\~
