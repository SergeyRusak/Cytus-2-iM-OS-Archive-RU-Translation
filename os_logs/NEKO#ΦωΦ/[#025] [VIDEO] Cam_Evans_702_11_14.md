**Daniel**<br>
Take a seat. My girlfriend is not here, and I don't know where she put the coffee. You two okay with just water?

**Vicky**<br>
Water is fine. Thank you.

**Hayato**<br>
So many trophies... Mr. Evans, you're a novelist? That's amazing.

**Daniel**<br>
Just call me Daniel.

**Vicky**<br>
Mr. Daniel, we were finally able to get hold of your home address. When we visited, your parents told us that you've already moved out and is living on your own.

**Daniel**<br>
Yes, I'm living together with my girlfriend now.<br>
Go ahead. What do you want to know?

**Vicky**<br>
... I'll let you handle this.

**Hayato**<br>
Miss Aroma's accident occurred around the time between grades I and J. When she returned to class, she already lost her memory. Is that correct?

**Daniel**<br>
Yes. Even though she was in a coma for almost a year, she still passed the continuation exam and continued to be in the same class as us. Back then, Aroma, me and a few other classmates were quite close and we all had pretty good grades.

**Hayato**<br>
We would like to know, that after returning to class, was there anything strange about Aroma?

**Daniel**<br>
... Maybe I was the only one who felt this way.

**Hayato**<br>
... What do you mean?

**Daniel**<br>
To be honest with you, Aroma didn't really have many close friends in class. She was such a wonderful girl, yet she wasn't popular. After she returned to class with her memory loss, those students who dislike her escalated their actions and began straight up bullying her...

**Hayato**<br>
......

**Daniel**<br>
That was also the time I started to notice that there's something... off about her. Sometimes, it felt like she has become a completely different person... She would have this strong and determined look in her eyes. She had this... aura about her, something I had never felt before from her past\-self. When that happened, I felt like I don't know who she is anymore...

**Hayato**<br>
......!

**Daniel**<br>
There were also plenty of other things. Some words she used, small gestures... Back then, I felt like me hysterically caring about all these minute details was really gross too. Therefore, I never told anybody about this, all the way until graduation.

**Hayato**<br>
You... her...

**Daniel**<br>
Yes, Had feelings for her. However, those are all things in the past. After graduation, I've never seen her again. Now, even if I see her on screen with all that glamour, she still feels so unfamiliar. It's like the time we spent together never existed in the first place...

**Hayato**<br>
......

**Daniel**<br>
... All in all, this is all I can say. Even though it's all things from a long time ago, when we heard that she went missing, both my girlfriend and I were still a bit worried. We truly hope she is safe.

**Hayato**<br>
... We will definitely figure out clearly what happened to her! To be honest, right now, we've already...

**Clara**<br>
Ah, guests?

**Daniel**<br>
... Clara, I didn't even hear you come in.

**Clara**<br>
Yikes! How could you serve the guests plain water? I'll go make some coffee!

**Vicky**<br>
No need to bother. It's about time we take our leave too. Thank you so much! Mr. Daniel, we appreciate your help!

**Hayato**<br>
Eh? Sis Vicky...?

**Clara**<br>
......<br>
... If there's any update on Aroma, please let us know.

**Hayato**<br>
.. Certainly!

*\[Door Closes\]*

**Daniel**<br>
... So you heard everything?

**Clara**<br>
Just a little bit. I'm sorry...

**Daniel**<br>
What is there to apologize for?

**Clara**<br>
Not the eavesdropping... It's for back then, when I helped other classmates bully Aroma...

**Daniel**<br>
......

**Clara**<br>
Aroma was truly everything. She was so beautiful, so smart and so good at singing.<br>
Every time I see her, I always feel like I'm so ordinary, so distasteful...<br>
Especially after she left, I hate myself even more for doing all those despicable things to her. I used to like her so much too, but the more I like you, the more I...

**Daniel**<br>
Right now, the one who's with me is you. I've never once considered you to be ordinary or distasteful.

**Clara**<br>
......

**Daniel**<br>
If you truly want to apologize, pray for her safety. Then, apologize to her directly.

**Clara**<br>
...... Okay!
