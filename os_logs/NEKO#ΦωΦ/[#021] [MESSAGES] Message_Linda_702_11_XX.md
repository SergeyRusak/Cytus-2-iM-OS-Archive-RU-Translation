A female reporter came to see our boss. She said she wanted to do an interview about UV, but she kept asking stuff about you and PAFF. I feel like she is already suspecting that PAFF is hiding in your home<br>

*[Sent at PM 03:50]*

**[NEKO#ΦωΦ]**<br>
AHHHHHHH<br>
*[Sent at PM 03:50]*

**[NEKO#ΦωΦ]**<br>
Do I need to tell AROMA chan<br>
*[Sent at PM 03:50]*

**Linda**<br>
Telling PAFF will only make her worry more, right? Her memory is still very messed up. It's best that we don't stimulate her anymore<br>

**Linda**<br>
If things really get out of hand, we'll ask that bar owner for help. He seems like a pretty nice person<br>
*[Sent at PM 03:51]*

**[NEKO#ΦωΦ]**<br>
Yeah...<br>
*[Sent at PM 03:51]*

**Linda**<br>
In short, when you guys go out these days, be careful. If it would attract too much attention, just don't do it<br>
*[Sent at PM 03:52]*

**[NEKO#ΦωΦ]**<br>
Okay<br>
