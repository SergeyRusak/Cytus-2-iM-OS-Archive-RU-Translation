WAHHH... It's really pouring. Shoulda listened to mommy and brought an umbrella. The weather report here is as sucky as always! I'm starting to miss Node 08...

*\[Running\]*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Aroma\-chan said it was somewhere around here...?<br>
......!<br>
Xenon...?

*\[Footsteps\]*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
......

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>

*\[Takes Picture\]*

**Xenon**<br>
......

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
You... What happened to you!? How did you end up like this!?

**Xenon**<br>
......

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Y\-Y\-Y\-You... You gotta go to the hospital! Let's go to Kyubo Medical Center? Nora will definitely help you for free! Ah, gotta tell everybody too.

*\[Pulls hand\]*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Erghhh~~~com' on and get up! NEKO can't pull ya all alone!

**Xenon**<br>
......

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
...Why aren't ya moving? Whatever! Getting soaked like this with all these cuts is no good! Let NEKO help you, huh? There's a pharmacy over there...

**Xenon**<br>
... Leave me alone.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
... eh? What?

**Xenon**<br>
Leave me alone... go away...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
NO WAY!! NEKO promised Aroma\-chan and others that I'd find you!

**Xenon**<br>
... And then? You found me. Now leave.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
What the heck is that!? Nora needs your help with a lotta stuff over there. NEKO shouldn't couldn't and wouldn't just leave you here.

**Xenon**<br>
......<br>
I... I can't do anything...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Whatta you mean? Xenon's amazing...

**Xenon**<br>
You don't understand, do you? All I see is the people around me getting caught up in terrible things... All because of me... ugh...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
It's not like that...

**Xenon**<br>
Go away. It's not safe with me.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
... Not safe? Well, well so what!? NEKO doesn't know what's going on with you, but I'm not just throwing you to the curb! NEKO knows you're upset about Sis Cherry... but so is everybody else! Point is, everybody's got to work together...

**Xenon**<br>
You done?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
... eh?

**Xenon**<br>
I've always... hated your personality.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
......!<br>
NEKO... just wanted...

**Xenon**<br>
All you do is blabber on about what you want to talk about. Don't care about anyone else's feelings. You don't know anything, yet you put on this façade of understanding just to feel validated.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
......

**Xenon**<br>
You just go on and on, so annoying. How old are you? An annoying brat who says the stupidest stuff. Everybody work together? Like what? Who is this "everybody" anyway? Didn't you run away from all that?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
*... \*sob\*...*

**Xenon**<br>
You're clearly not of any use. No need to say that crap to me. I've heard enough of your voice. If you want to feel validated, go somewhere else. Or maybe go fish for compliments from your fans on the internet. I don't care, just go away...

*\[Slap\]*

**Xenon**<br>
......!?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
... You... big, dumb idiot... *\*sob\**... Fine, you can just rot here!

*\[Running\]*

**Xenon**<br>
