**[Platform Announcement]**<br>
*Attention, fellow passengers. The express train directly to Node 03 is now arriving at the platform. For your own safety, please stand behind the yellow line.*

**Vicky**<br>
It's almost time. You kids all prepared?

**Hayato**<br>
All set, Sis Vicky.<br>
... Thank you so much.

**Vicky**<br>
What the heck? You're being weird.

**Hayato**<br>
I never thought you would go this far to help us. You even applied for press passes and got a dedicated carriage for us. This stuff isn't cheap, right...?

**Vicky**<br>
Well, that's all I can do really. Judging by how PAFF looks now... what you said is true. In that case, you won't make any progress staying here. Take her to Node 03.

**Hayato**<br>
Yes!

**Vicky**<br>
Here, you two ladies should get ready to board the train too.

**PAFF**<br>
Thank you, Miss Russell!

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
......

**PAFF**<br>
NEKO?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
08 Daily... Isn't that the media that secretly sneaked photos of NEKO's home? Popping out all of a sudden and saying you want to help... you can't fool NEKO! NEKO doesn't trust you! You're gonna write some BS news report about this, aren't you?  

**Hayato**<br>
Umm.. that's... It's not what you think...

**Vicky**<br>
How rude. I help you guys arrange all this stuff. I don't think it's too much to expect a "thank you"... This is why I hate dim\-witted little girls like you.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Who you calling little!? Who asked for your help? Smelly Paparazzi! Old Hag!

**Vicky**<br>
... O\-OLD HAG!?

**PAFF**<br>
A\-apologies, Miss Russell! We'll be leaving right away... NEKO. 

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Wait a second! NEKO's not done yet...

*\[Train arrives\]*

**Vicky**<br>
Goddamnit, that stinkin wildcat... Hey, Hayato!

**Hayato**<br>
Ah, umm, yes!

**Vicky**<br>
I promised you that I would back out from PAFF news. However, you need to watch that NEKO carefully. She kind of is a celebrity in her own right and is notorious for running wild. She might expose your whereabouts on accident. Don't waste my money, understand?

**Hayato**<br>
U\-understood...

**Vicky**<br>
Why the long face? If you have something to say, say it.

**Hayato**<br>
Nothing... I was just thinking, why don't you come with us? You also want to know what happened to PAFF, right?

**Vicky**<br>
Of course. I'm a journalist first, human second. But\~ I've long been blacklisted by Node 03's Administration Bureau, which denies me any form of entry. Not even special privileges can get me in there, so I can only leave it to you.

**Vicky**<br>
... Besides, if being a paparazzi was all I could think about after hearing your stories, the Vicky Russell that once pursued justice and truth at all costs... is perhaps no longer in me anymore.

**Hayato**<br>
Sis Vicky...

**Vicky**<br>
However, don't you misunderstand me! My instincts tell me that there are still plenty of shady secrets to be found in what happened to PAFF. If we can keep investigating, we might be able to catch an even bigger fish.

**Hayato**<br>
Sis Vicky! Actually...

*\[Platform Announcement Ring\]*

**[Platform Announcement]**<br>
*Attention, fellow passengers. The express train directly to Node 03 is about to depart. For passengers who haven't board the train, please board soon. Thank you for your cooperation.*

**Vicky**<br>
Enough talking. The train is leaving. Take care and protect those girls, will ya.

**Hayato**<br>
G\-got it!

**Vicky**<br>
Good, I expect no less from the disciple I raised myself. You've now obtained the eye of an experienced journalist. Once you're there, don't you dare forget the things I taught you. Do you hear me?

**Hayato**<br>
I'm just an intern...

**Vicky**<br>
Do you hear me!

**Hayato**<br>
Y\-Yes ma'am!

**Vicky**<br>
Alright, now go... Remember, you are NOT allowed to come back before you find the truth.

**Hayato**<br>
... Thank you so much!
