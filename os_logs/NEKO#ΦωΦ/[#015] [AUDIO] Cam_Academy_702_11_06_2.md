This sucks... why am I the one harassed by the weird lecturer... But if I drop the course, I won't have enough credits...

**Hawk**<br>
Hey, you're Neko Asakura, right?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
......? Who the heck are you?

**Raven**<br>
Hawk, this is the Academy. Stop that.<br>
Miss Asakura, I am Raven, a law enforcement agent from Node 08 Administration Bureau. This is my partner, Hawk. There are some things we would like to ask you. Can you spare us some time?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
......<br>
NEKO doesn't have time, bye\-bye.

**Raven**<br>
... Previously, we suspended the investigation on you because of the evidence turned in by Simon Jackson. That shifted the direction of our investigation.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
... And what do you guys want?

**Raven**<br>
No need to be nervous... In fact, that evidence is currently being re\-evaluated. In order to confirm your innocence a second time, we would like to ask you a few questions. Please be sure to cooperate with us. This is for your own good too.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
... NEKO has nothing to tell you losers already!

**Hawk**<br>
Jackson's confession has pretty much confirmed his crimes. I advise you to not try to hide anything from us.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
……Xenon……

**Raven**<br>
Miss Asakura, as an important affiliate of this case, the testimony you provided will be essential. If this case can be clarified as soon as possible, we will no longer bother you anymore either.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
......

**Raven**<br>
So? Did you recall anything? According to the information we obtained, after you were acquitted, you were able to recover your memory that covered the time of the attack. This is identical to the symptoms of the victims who were attacked during the first incident at Æsir\-FEST. We are also willing to believe that you were merely a victim.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
... No...

**Raven**<br>
If your memory has recovered, you should be able to remember something. For example, at the time of your attack, were there any abnormal connections? What kind of images did you see? Something like that.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
... Stop asking! NEKO doesn't know anything!<br>
Xenon is not the criminal! You idiots definitely arrested the wrong person!

**Raven**<br>
Sighs... can't help it then. Hawk, take that thing out.

*\[Device activate\]*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
... What is that!? What are you guys going to do!?

**Raven**<br>
This device can probe the memory. It will clearly tell us what images you saw at a specific time frame. Although we are still unsure whether or not we can see the memory during a virtual internet connection, since you insisted on not speaking, we had no choice but to resort to force.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
N... NO!

**Raven**<br>
If you lied, it leaves us with no other option but to put you in custody again. Your family will be very sad too, right? From what we know, this is going to hurt a bit. We don't want to do this to a young girl either. If you know something, I suggest you behave yourself and tell us. Did Simon Jackson actually come in contact with you during the attack?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
... Xenon is...!

**ConneR**<br>
Hoho? A device that can probe the memory? Now that's impressive.

**Raven**<br>
......!? It's you.

**ConneR**<br>
The first device that can probe the memory was developed in N.A. 700 by A.R.C. virtual internetologist Jacob Wilson. The size of that device is about the same size as a chair. In addition, that experiment also failed the human subject test later. I certainly don't recall A.R.C. developing such a lightweight and convenient memory probe. Would you mind if I take a closer look?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
......!

**Hawk**<br>
... What does this have to do with you!? What the hell are you doing here!?

**ConneR**<br>
Oh, apologies. I'm here to give a lecture. "Contribute to society and A.R.C. as a form of probation." Wasn't you admins the ones that issued that order? 

**Hawk**<br>
That bulls\*\*\* was issued by the higher\-ups... I should've just shot you dead back then!

**ConneR**<br>
Hahaha, you know that's impossible, don't you? Two naive little fowls, your methods are as amusing as always. Speaking of which, what exactly are you trying to do here, eh? Harassing such a cute young girl. 

**Student**<br>
Hey, what's happening there? Something big seems to be going on.

**ConneR**<br>
See, the students are starting to gather.

**Hawk**<br>
Enough! I'll take both of you back to the Bureau first!

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Wah! Let go of me!

**[Enforcer Drone]**<br>
*Unable to perform arrest. Authorization insufficient.*

**Hawk**<br>
!?

**ConneR**<br>
How pathetic. Unfortunately for you, my body right now is the property of the Administration Bureau higher\-ups and A.R.C. On top of that, I'm technically serving my sentence now. With the authorization level of you two, arresting me is quite unlikely.

**Hawk**<br>
You little...

**Student**<br>
Let go of her! She didn't do anything!

**Student**<br>
What is all the fuss about!? We still have classes to take, you know!

**Hawk**<br>
Shut up! We are currently conducting official business. Do not interfere, or we will arrest you people as well!

**ConneR**<br>
Oh? You didn't even show a warrant. From what I can tell, all you've done is trying to force a suspicious device onto an innocent student. I don't think any sane person would refer to this as doing "official business".

**Student**<br>
Yeah, that's right! Stop trying to bully us! You think you can get away with everything just 'cause you're an agent!?

**Student**<br>
What is your serial number? I'll report your sorry a\*\*!

**ConneR**<br>
*\*Chuckles\** Looks like your plan to take credit for the case has backfired spectacularly, little fowls. Right now, there is nothing you folks can do to her. Flex all you want and threaten her all you want; it is nothing but empty fluff. Better get back to your cozy nest and rethink things over.

**Raven**<br>
Forget it! Hawk, let's go.<br>
Miss Asakura, we will visit you again...

*\[Engine sounds\]*

**ConneR**<br>
Thought they would at least improve a bit after all this time... How boring. Alright, everything is fine now. Go home.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
T... thank you.

**ConneR**<br>
I see a cute student in trouble, I offer my help, naturally.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
U...Umm, about that!

**ConneR**<br>
... The bonus points, are you interested now?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
......

**ConneR**<br>
As you just saw, I am not on the same side as the admins. Rest assured.<br>
About the Æsir incident, so you do have some secrets you're hiding after all, right?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
... So you also think... that Xenon is guilty?

**ConneR**<br>
*\*Chuckles\** Let's find a place so we can talk about that in detail.

*[Signal Lost]*
