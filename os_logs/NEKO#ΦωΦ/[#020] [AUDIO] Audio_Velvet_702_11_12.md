Sigh... Linda, wanna close the store and go grab a drink?

**Linda**<br>
Please do your job properly, Boss... There are still the documents for the Rock Festival we have to go through.

**Jacky**<br>
How cold. Can't you be kinder to an old man?

**Linda**<br>
You're the one who said that you'll be reviewing the band documents yourself.

**Jacky**<br>
No profit whatsoever, rookie band complains that the sound field sucks, proceeds to rip off the Hi\-hat and smash it...<br>
If I knew it would be this tiring, I wouldn't have organized it in the first place...

**Linda**<br>
All that whining yet you still keep organizing it. Don't bring trouble on yourself if you don't want to.

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Vicky**<br>
Excuse me, is the manager here?

**Jacky**<br>
Manager is currently escaping from life so he's not here\~

**Linda**<br>
That's enough... Miss, are you here to tour the venue?

**Vicky**<br>
No. I am a member of the media. I would like to do an interview. Could you spare me a few minutes?

**Linda**<br>
Boss Jacky?

**Jacky**<br>
So bothersome. What interview... HM!?

**Linda**<br>
... Boss?

**Jacky**<br>
Apologies, I didn't see clearly. Turns out it's such a pretty lady... Please, come on in, come on in!<br>
Linda, make two cups of coffee for us. The best we have!

**Vicky**<br>
Ara, thank you\~ Then pardon me for the intrusion.

**Linda**<br>
......

**Jacky**<br>
... PAFF did indeed perform here in the past. It was a few years ago when she just made her debut. She was still very shy... but her singing was fantastic.

**Vicky**<br>
She hasn't come here since she became more popular?

**Jacky**<br>
Yeah. Mono decided to let her focus on virtual Lives... After all, she is not the type of singer who is good at stirring up the atmosphere either. <br>
Compare to her, Cherry is pretty amazing at that. Ballad, rock, her range covers everything!

**Vicky**<br>
Mr. Jacky, so you remember every single musician who has performed at UV?

**Jacky**<br>
Even if I don't remember all of them, I'm sure it's around 80 to 90 percent, haha! After all, we are the most awesome Live House in all of Node 08. Everyone wants to work with us.

**Vicky**<br>
That's incredible. If there's the chance, I would love to do an exclusive interview... About your philosophy and passion for this business, just you and me, 1\-on\-1...

**Jacky**<br>
Hehe, of course I'm down with that! Feel free to come anytime!

**Linda**<br>
... Excuse me, coffee.

**Vicky**<br>
Ah, thank you.

*\[Drinks coffee\]*

**Vicky**<br>
Speaking of which, you can recall young musicians as well, right? There's a little girl DJ who gain popularity these days; I'm very interested in her.

**Jacky**<br>
Little girl DJ... Oh, you mean NEKO?

**Linda**<br>
......!

**Vicky**<br>
Ah, yes. That is indeed her name. I heard that she's a regular at UV?

**Jacky**<br>
Yep. She is a loyal customer of ours. She comes here so often that all of us know her... Don't we, Linda?

**Linda**<br>
Ah... yeah.

**Vicky**<br>
Miss here is her friend?

**Linda**<br>
... We're not really close. We had a few quick chats and that's about it.

**Vicky**<br>
I see. Does she come here by herself? Has she ever brought friends with her?

**Linda**<br>
... I'm not really certain...

**Jacky**<br>
I think she tends to come here by herself... To be honest, these years it has been more and more difficult to promote indie bands...

**Vicky**<br>
Thanks for doing the hard work. Does she still come here often recently?

**Jacky**<br>
Not really. Recently, she has come here a lot less. She's probably busy.

**Linda**<br>
... Boss, I need to go watch the store. You two, take your time.

**Jacky**<br>
Oh, gotcha. I'll leave it to you then\~

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Linda**<br>
... She's definitely up to something.
