**PAFF**<br>
NEKO!

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Waah!? Aroma\-chan... Are you guys good already? It's okay if you guys want to stay a little longer.

**PAFF**<br>
Being able to remember Grandma Feng is more than enough. I'm sure she won't want to see me be a sobbing mess. I have to cheer up!<br>
Speaking of which, what are you doing?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Eh? Ahaha... nothing really. NEKO just thinks that the face on this gravestone is very funny. Especially the nose...

**Hayato**<br>
... What? Weren't you also crying just now? Man, your mood changes way too fast...

**PAFF**<br>
Come on\~ You can't disrespect those who have passed on. Grandma Feng told us before, that the dead will protect us from where they are. Right, Hayato?

**Hayato**<br>
... Yes. Grandma also said that the only thing we, the people still living, can do for them is to remember them. As long as we still remember them, they aren't truly dead. They will forever be by our side.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
That sounds beautiful... Grandma Feng feels like a really kind person.

**PAFF**<br>
Yes. She's the best grandma in the entire world.

**Hayato**<br>
That's right! Ah, NEKO's grandma is really great too.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Then, I'll have to apologize to this person.<br>
I'm sorry. NEKO didn't do it on purpose, even though you really do look very funny... I hope you have a happy life on that side and you meet a girl who doesn't care about your nose...

**Hayato**<br>
... What kind of apology is that?

**PAFF**<br>
Haha... it's very "NEKO".

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Alright, let's go back\~

**Hayato**<br>
Uh, umm, NEKO...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
What, Intern Paparazzi guy?

**Hayato**<br>
D\-don't call me that... Have you seen our bags?<br>
They were here just a minute ago...

**PAFF**<br>
... Ah...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
...... Eh!? EHHHHHHH\~\~\~!?

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
N, nothing! Not here either. They're nowhere to be found!!

**Hayato**<br>
Could they have been stolen? There are quite a few pickpockets around here...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Oh god, oh no, we're screwed. The press passes the old hag gave us are inside the bags! Without that, we're all gonna get arrested by the admins the moment we go back to 08!

**Hayato**<br>
This is really bad... I\-I'll keep looking around...

**PAFF**<br>
Maybe they're... Hmm...?

*\[Collapse\]*

**Hayato**<br>
Kaori!? Kaori!!

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Aroma\-chan!?

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

**PAFF**<br>
... Eh? What happened to me?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
You fainted all of a sudden! Don't move, your nose is still dripping blood...

**PAFF**<br>
......! The bags!

*\[Runs\]*

**Hayato**<br>
Eh? Hey! Kaori!? Where are you going?

**PAFF**<br>
I know where they are. Come with me.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
F\-For real?

*[→Signal Switches]*

**PAFF**<br>
Huff... Puff... Found them! The bags really are here. Some homeless person took them.

**Hayato**<br>
......

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Thank goodness. Everything inside is still there!

**Hayato**<br>
Kaori, how did you know...

**PAFF**<br>
I... I don't know myself either. When I fainted back there, I think I had... a dream?

**Hayato**<br>
A dream...? No, the state you were in back then... it was exactly like "The Eye of Horus".

**PAFF**<br>
The Eye of Horus...? Ah, I\-I think I heard this name back there too... Hayato, how did you know that name?

**Hayato**<br>
I wasn't able to finish my story back there. After Grandma Feng passed away, I spent every last bit of money I had to seek the help of Kyuu Hou Kai's "The Eye of Horus". It was the clues she gave me that took me to Node 08 in my search for you!

**PAFF**<br>
Kyuu Hou Kai! That's the place she just showed me. We must go there!

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
What? Excuse me, what? Why does NEKO have no freakin idea what you two are talking about?

**Hayato**<br>
... I think I know where it's located, but that entire area was reduced to rubble not too long ago because of a massive gas explosion...

**PAFF**<br>
No, I got... an address.

**Hayato**<br>
However... that organization is a bit dangerous. Are you sure you want to go?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
... Um, Hello? Aroma\-chan? Intern Paparazzi guy? Can you guys, um, explain things a bit to NEKO? NEKO's brain is gonna explode with all the information you guys just spewed...
