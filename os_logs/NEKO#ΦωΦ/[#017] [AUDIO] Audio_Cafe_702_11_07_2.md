**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Well... that's pretty much it. Did you understand what I just said?

**Linda**<br>
......

**JOE**<br>
......

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
......

**JOE**<br>
HAAAA!? So Xenon really was the one that attacked you!?

**Linda**<br>
PAFF is hiding in your home right now!?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Y, you guys are too loud!

**Linda**<br>
Oh... sorry!

**JOE**<br>
Please, gimme a moment... Too much information... My brain needs time to process it a bit...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Ahhhh~ NEKO has no idea what she should do now! Help me~~ Linda\-Chuwan~

**Linda**<br>
Your troubles escalated way too damn fast this time. I don't know what I can help with... However, let's all calm down and organize the current situation first.<br>
First, the Xenon stuff. Right now, it seems that everyone believes he is the culprit. After watching his trial...

**JOE**<br>
However, we all know that he absolutely is not. We have sufficient evidence with us to prove that.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
NEKO doesn't believe it either! But...

**Linda**<br>
Is there anyone else that knows about these things?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Yes... I've discussed it with a lecturer at the Academy. He said that NEKO's memory was likely altered.

**JOE**<br>
... That sounds insane.

**Linda**<br>
... However, if I am Æsir, I would absolutely try my best to mess with the direction of the investigation. Thus, it's not completely out of the question...

**JOE**<br>
If he can do something like this, wouldn't that make him invincible?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
No... The lecturer told me that the things Æsir can do should be rather limited. Or else, he wouldn't have to go through all that trouble coming up with such a complicated plan. Even if my memory was indeed altered, it's also possible that it's only a small part... And he can only do it to me, who was directly attacked by him.

**Linda**<br>
Who is this lecturer you're talking about?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
A guy name Colin... something? NEKO forgot his full name...

**JOE**<br>
Colin Neumann?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Yes, him!

**JOE**<br>
Then it's very credible... This way, we are closer and closer to proving that Xenon was framed.<br>
NEKO, you don't have to worry about Simon's case. I have the information here. On top of that, somebody is already dealing with it. He will be fine. Trust me.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Eh?

**Linda**<br>
... What do you mean by "dealing"?

**JOE**<br>
Well... In short, the worst case scenario is that he will be directly yanked out of the restricted area.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Ehhhhh? Is that really okay? He won't be caught up in something dangerous, right?

**JOE**<br>
There really is no other option. All A.R.C. and the admins are doing now is passing the buck around and trying to close this case as fast as possible. If it's a mystery about the virtual internet, then he's the only guy that can solve it. However, we have to get him out of there first.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
... Yeah.

**Linda**<br>
Then what about PAFF? Do you plan to keep sheltering her?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Yes... NEKO wants to do what she can and continue to help her recover her memory!

**JOE**<br>
Have you gotten any clues so far?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
A while ago, we found a place that might be where her classmate previously lived. It's near Mountain Breeze Musique.

**JOE**<br>
Mountain Breeze Musique eh... how nostalgic.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
However, NEKO is a bit busy with Academy work these days. On top of that, I was a bit lost with all the Xenon stuff, so I never had the chance to take her there...<br>
Alright then! We'll visit there and take a look in a few days!

**Linda**<br>
Don't force yourself. Your own memory is in a messy state now too...

**JOE**<br>
Ah, one more thing. If you really can't hide her anymore, come to me. I have a hiding place here that will never be discovered.

**Linda**<br>
If you have any problems, I will help as well. Don't forget that.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Okay... Waaaaaa~ Thank you guys so much!

**Linda**<br>
Okay okay, stop faking it. You're gonna spill the drink!
