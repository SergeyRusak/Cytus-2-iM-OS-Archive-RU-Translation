Ha... *\*grunts\**... gotta admit... you're pretty good... "X"... How about a drink? Whiskey? Kaoliang?

**Xenon**<br>
......

**Diego**<br>
A single person took out my entire 03 branch... a talent like you... being "up there" is truly... quite a shame... ha...

**Xenon**<br>
......

**Diego**<br>
... And now? What's all this for...? If you want revenge... then I can only tell you, you came to the wrong place... what happened to your girl, that wasn't us...

**Xenon**<br>
... Shut up.

*\[Loads Gun\]*

**Diego**<br>
... Haha ... it's the truth. Someone as smart as you must know? There's no way we... have the technology or skill to deal that much damage to Kyuu Hou Kai... But regardless of who it was... I'm very happy that they did it before us.

*\[Punch\]*

**Diego**<br>
Poo wah!! Ha... hahaha... You've been blinded by your anger and hatred... Mr. Smart guy... Just like... ha... your dad back then...

**Xenon**<br>
......!

**Diego**<br>
The moment you pull that trigger, you'll become someone "down here"... Ain't no different... from us... haha...But, you can't pull it, can you?

**Xenon**<br>
... *\*gulp\**...

*\[Drinks Liquor\]*

**Diego**<br>
I've... spent a lifetime helping... the trash at the bottom... helped them find a new worth... a purpose in life...<br>
Don't you think... you also really need this kind of help right now? People act like these kinds of trash doesn't exist. Always pretending like they're living in a wonderful, clean city... Once someone is abandoned by the system...  they all need redemption, otherwise they can't survive... I'm the one who gives them redemption. I am their redeemer.

**Xenon**<br>
......

**Diego**<br>
If you still insist on pulling that trigger, then at least... let me finish... this last glass of liquor...

*\[Pulls out gun\]*

**Xenon**<br>
......!?

*\[Consecutive Gunshots\]*

*[→Signal Switches]*

*\[Holding umbrella\]*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
... Ey. You dead?

**Xenon**<br>
......<br>
Didn't I tell you to go away?

*\[Squats down\]*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
......

*\[Wraps up wound\]*

**Xenon**<br>
......

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
... Your wounds are definitely gonna rot. The rain here is really dirty.

**Xenon**<br>
... I don't care...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
You don't care, but NEKO does.

**Xenon**<br>
......<br>
I advise you... to get out of here fast... people might still be chasing me...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
......!<br>
What happened with the gangs... that was really you...?

**Xenon**<br>
......

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
......<br>
Whatevs, I gotta at least patch you up first.

**Xenon**<br>
I'm serious.<br>
You better...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
ANY! WAY!

**Xenon**<br>
AH! Ouch!

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Anyway, NEKO does whatever she wants. I don't care what anyone else thinks. If I wanna do it I do it. If I see someone I Ii... an important friend looking like this, I can't just turn away and ignore them.

**Xenon**<br>
......

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
......<br>
NEKO may not be... for something this big... no even for something small, NEKO may not be of much help. But I still want to try my best to do what I can. And yea maybe I do want to feel validated and noticed. You can hate NEKO, I don't care, NEKO's still gonna do it. Besides, you can't move so what're you gonna do 'bout it?

**Xenon**<br>
......

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Okay all done~ Don't move for now. NEKO already contacted Brother Kai to take you to his place. He'll definitely be able to pick ya up.

*[→Signal Switches]*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Yahooo!! NEKO's here! Brother Kai, thank you. Is Xenon alright?

**Kai**<br>
After he came home yesterday he locked himself in his room... Won't answer any questions.

*\[Door Knock\]*

**Kai**<br>
It's no use. When this guy feels down, he hates it when people bother him.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Ah Ah... Ooo, yea he was pretty pissed at NEKO yesterday.

**Kai**<br>
Usually he'll be fine if you leave him alone for a while. But this time... I don't know how much time he'll need...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
......<br>
This food, did you buy it for him? He hasn't eaten any of it...

**Kai**<br>
Yea, I'll chuck it.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
*\*groan\**... Xenon is super picky, this will definitely not do. Soooo, Tada～～NEKO brought some of her homemade stew! He luuuuved this when he tasted it before! <br>
Xenon, NEKO put some stew here, don't forget to eat it! If you don't, NEKO's gonna give you another big ol' slap!

**Kai**<br>
... Ay, It actually smells really good. Can I have a bite?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
NO WAY! This is for Xenon!

**Kai**<br>
Stingy brat.<br>
Oh, yea... thanks. If you didn't find him. Don't know what woulda happened...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
No probs～～well, let's leave him alone. Let him be. Xenon, we're heading out, kk?
