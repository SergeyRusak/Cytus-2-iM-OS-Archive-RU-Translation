**Student A**<br>
Sigh... Why do we have to come to school for a stupid seminar during break...

**Student B**<br>
Can't help it. This is the last extra credit opportunity of the semester. If we don't take it, neither of us can graduate.

**Student C**<br>
I want to go home...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
NEKO wants to go home too...

**Student A**<br>
Wow! It's NEKO! Did you flunk the semester as well?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Sigh\~\~\~ Yeah, because of the stream incident last time. Like, what the hell! I just wanted to introduce the Academy to my fans!

**Student B**<br>
Can I sit next to you? We're all big fans of you!

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Sure\~ 

*\[Door Opens\]*

**ConneR**<br>
Please be quiet. Class is about to start.

**Student A**<br>
Yikes, who is that...?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
He seems a bit familiar...

**ConneR**<br>
Good morning, students. I am your lecturer today. My name is Colin Neumann Jr.<br>
At the end of today's lesson, there will be a system examination. Although it has nothing to do with me, if you want to graduate on time, I advise trying your best.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Woah... what a smug teacher.

**Student B**<br>
Isn't Colin Neumann the guy the news said is dead a while ago...?

*\[Putting down heavy things\]*

**Student**<br>
...... An ant colony!?

**ConneR**<br>
Today, I'm going to introduce you young folks to one of my researches. It's about an endangered species found in the desert landscapes located on the east side of 08's forbidden area. They're called "Crystal Ants". You can clearly observe their colony through the glass.

**ConneR**<br>
The first appearance of this type of ant can date back to around three hundred years ago. Unlike other creatures in the Formicidae family, they have a clear, transparent, almost luminous body. On top of that, they are also abnormally intelligent and have a well\-developed social system. Pretty magnificent creatures, aren't they?

**ConneR**<br>
Crystal Ants are the only type of creature that will "actively" invade the territory of other ants in that habitat. Even if their own colonies are already very prosperous, they will continue to exterminate other ants in order to expand their own territory. On top of that, they are also one of the very few insect species that knows how to use tools. For example, when they detect that their colony is in danger, they will use all kinds of poisonous thorny plants to protect their colony. <br>


**ConneR**<br>
This type of ant reproduces at terrifying speeds. While not very poisonous themselves, their deadly aggression and intelligence allowed them to overpower everything. In a very short time, no other species of ant exist in that habitat anymore. They've also ascended to the top of the food chain, having almost no natural enemy. 

**Student A**<br>
Won't other animals attack them?

**ConneR**<br>
Very good question. In my hand is a "Desert Rat". Its staple food is ants. Now, I will put it in this glass case.

**Student**<br>
......!!

**ConneR**<br>
Crystal Ants always move in astonishingly large groups. Whenever they are attacked, no matter how big the attacker may be... this is what happens. They will engulf the attacker in minutes and chew him to death, one small bit at a time. The corpse of this Desert Rat will likely dissolve completely within ten minutes. Not even its bones will be left behind.

**Student**<br>
... Ewww...

**ConneR**<br>
Now, why does this seemingly perfect creature end up extinct? That's because, in a desert where resources are scarce, their habitat simply could not withstand their huge appetite. Their lifespan is actually very short, and they don't have the ability to move to another location...

**ConneR**<br>
Pretty ironic, isn't it? After all, they are the most superior existence of their species. Yet, in the end, they went extinct simply because the environment is unable of withstanding their own capabilities.

**Student**<br>
......

**ConneR**<br>
The Crystal Ants in this case are probably the last surviving batch in the entire world. Even now, they have no clue of the dire situation and continue to refer to themselves as kings in this tiny box... How cute. *\*Chuckles\**\~

**Student B**<br>
That lecturer... he feels so... weird. I don't want to take his classes anymore...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Yeah\~ So much for NEKO thinking that he's kinda handsome...

**ConneR**<br>
I appreciate your compliment.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
WAAHH!?

**ConneR**<br>
Miss Neko Asakura... right?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
... Yes. Is there something you want?

**ConneR**<br>
Even though the grades will be announced by the system at a later date, I managed to sneak a quick peek. You... failed, unfortunately.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
EHHHHH!? How come...

**ConneR**<br>
It's true. You can see for yourself, a 55.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Oh crap... This is bad! This is really, really bad!

**ConneR**<br>
Hmm\~ It's not like there's no space for a few bonus points.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
For real!? Please, please let NEKO pass! I don't want to flunk the whole semester!

**Student B**<br>
Hey! What are you trying to do!?

**ConneR**<br>
*\*Chuckles\** No need to be so tense. I just want to know some things about the Æsir attack incident. As a victim yourself, do you have any interesting information you can tell me?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
......!?

**Student B**<br>
That has nothing to do with the course, right!? <br>
Stop asking that ridiculous crap!

**ConneR**<br>
What a shame... I will consider about the bonus points. Here is my contact information. Feel free to visit me whenever you feel like it, Miss Kittyears.

**Student B**<br>
NEKO, let's go!
