**Hayato**<br>
Who would call...? NEKO!?

*[Call Starts]*

**Hayato**<br>
NEKO! Where are you?

**[NEKO#ΦωΦ]**<br>
*On my way home... Is Aroma\-chan there?*

**PAFF**<br>
I'm here. We plan to stay here to continue helping Nora out.

**[NEKO#ΦωΦ]**<br>
*MmmHmm... \*Sniffs\*...*

**PAFF**<br>
NEKO... are you alright?

**[NEKO#ΦωΦ]**<br>
*None*

**Hayato**<br>
They were sent by Mr. Daigo to protect you. I think they'll leave once you arrive home.

**[NEKO#ΦωΦ]**<br>
*NEKO knows... \*sobs\*...*

**PAFF**<br>
... NEKO...

**[NEKO#ΦωΦ]**<br>
*Aroma\-chan, I'm sorry... I said I was going to help you, but...<br>
NEKO doesn't know what's wrong with me either...*

**PAFF**<br>
No, it's okay! NEKO has really helped me a lot already. I'm really grateful to you.

**[NEKO#ΦωΦ]**<br>
*Even the totally useless Hayato chose to stay behind... NEKO is such a coward...*

**Hayato**<br>
... I can hear all that, you know...<br>
NEKO, besides staying by Kaori's side, there's nowhere else for me to go in Node 03. You still have family who's worried about you, right? With the situation this dangerous, it's the right choice to go back home and report your safety first. I'll try my best to protect Kaori. Remember to stay in contact, okay?

**[NEKO#ΦωΦ]**<br>
*Okay... Hayato, you're a good person. NEKO was wrong about you.*

**Hayato**<br>
It's alright. Miss Cherry's incident... I think we're all feeling very down now. Go home and get some rest first.

**[NEKO#ΦωΦ]**<br>
*\*Sniff\*... If anything bad happens to Aroma\-chan, NEKO will NOT let you off the hook!*

**Hayato**<br>
Yeah, I know.

**[NEKO#ΦωΦ]**<br>
*Aroma\-chan, please be careful. NEKO... will try my best to figure out if there's anything I can help with.*

**PAFF**<br>
Okay... Ah, there's one thing. Xenon has gone missing. We all think it's best that we find him as soon as possible. If you can, can you pay attention to where he might go, since you're more familiar with 03 than us?

**[NEKO#ΦωΦ]**<br>
*... Got it! I remember Sis Cherry mentioned that the person who helped them was Kai, the drummer of Crystal PuNK. NEKO will try to get in contact with him.*

**PAFF**<br>
We'll leave that to you —— Ah, but that's after you get home and organize your emotions, of course.

**[NEKO#ΦωΦ]**<br>
*Okay...*

**PAFF**<br>
NEKO... Allow me to repeat one more time. Thank you, thank you for everything you've done for me.

**[NEKO#ΦωΦ]**<br>
*Aroma\-chan... We're still friends, right?*

**PAFF**<br>
Of course! We'll always be!

**[NEKO#ΦωΦ]**<br>
*Hehe... thanks. Then, NEKO's gotta go since I'm almost home. Bye\-bye\~*

*[Call Ends]*

*[→Signal Switches]*

*\[Door Knock\]*

**Saku**<br>
Coming!

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Saku**<br>
NEKO! We're so worried about you! When we saw those reports on the news, we've been wondering whether they're about you or not... How are you feeling? Are you okay? Did you get hurt?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
......

**Saku**<br>
NEKO...?

*\[Hugs\]*

**Saku**<br>
......!

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
......

**Saku**<br>
......<br>
You silly child... you must be tired, right?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
...... *\*Nods\**
