Ooh, lucky. No customers in the shop now. Aroma\-chan, wait here. I'll be done in a minute.

**PAFF**<br>
Okay.

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Frank**<br>
Welcome to "Mountain Breeze Musique".

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Helllooo!

**Frank**<br>
NEKO! It has been a long time! How's the machine last time? Have you gotten used to it?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Yep! The sound is super awesome!

**Frank**<br>
Good to hear that. So? What are you looking for today?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Eh\~ I'm not here to buy instruments today. I want to ask uncle Frank something

**Frank**<br>
Ho? What is it?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
The place on this photo, it's around here, right? Do you recognize where this is?

**Frank**<br>
Hmm... Lemme see. Nothing comes to mind, really. However, if it's able to capture our sign... Judging from the direction, if you go out, turn right and keep walking, you'll probably see a lot of similar alleys, I think?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Eh\~? But I want to know which one it is\~ The alleys there are way too complicated.

**Frank**<br>
Hold on. Let me ask the part\-timer.<br>
Hey! Ting! Come over here for a minute. Do you know where this is?

**Ting**<br>
Hmm? Oh, I know this place. It's pretty close to my house.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Really!?

**Ting**<br>
Yeah. It's not the easiest place to get to. I'll write you the address. Give me a sec.

**Frank**<br>
Welcome to "Mountain Breeze Musique".

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Aroma\-chan!?

**PAFF**<br>
......

**Frank**<br>
Miss, are you looking for something?

**PAFF**<br>
Ah... I...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
WAH\~ Hahaha, she is NEKO's friend. Don't mind her.

**Frank**<br>
......?

*\[Hurried Footsteps\]*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
What are you doing? Didn't NEKO tell you to wait outside?

**PAFF**<br>
I'm sorry... But there's a group of people across the street who kept staring at me. I think they recognized me...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Ehhhh...?

**Ting**<br>
I've written down the address. Here it is.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Waaah!? Ah... thanks, part\-timer!

**Ting**<br>
Don't call me part\-timer... Are you guys buying anything?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Umm... Nope! Uncle Frank, we'll be on our way! Thanks! See ya!

**Ting**<br>
Hey... wait a second! Are you PAF...

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Linda**<br>
Ting! You messed up UV's order again! How many times is this? I'm tired of getting chewed out by boss because of your screw\-ups!

**Ting**<br>
Woah! Linda!

**Linda**<br>
Here, check it yourself. This time, you better do it carefully.

**Ting**<br>
Ummm...

**Linda**<br>
Go, now.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Ah... gotcha!

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Ting**<br>
I don't think there's anything wrong...

**Linda**<br>
Hmm? Is that so? Huh, you're right. Then I guess I made a mistake, sorry.

**Ting**<br>
That girl just now, don't you think she looks a lot like PAFF!?

**Linda**<br>
Dude, you serious?<br>
Stop dreaming, you cream Puff
