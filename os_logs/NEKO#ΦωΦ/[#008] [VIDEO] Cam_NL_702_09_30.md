You can sleep first. Lemme see... you can sleep on the bed. NEKO doesn't mind sleeping on the floor.

**PAFF**<br>
Eh...? I shouldn't do that...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Nah, don't worry about it~ You haven't had a proper sleep in weeks, right? Besides, even if NEKO sleeps on the bed, more often than not I'll wake up and find myself on the floor.

**PAFF**<br>
Haha... Thank you.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
NEKO still has some work to do. I'll sleep later. Goodnight.

**PAFF**<br>
Goodnight.

*\[Door Closes\]*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Whew~ Alrighty then, what should I do next?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
The missing PAFF turns out to be in NEKO's home. This is the stuff that will make every single news headline!

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Regardless, gotta get online and put this gossip out there!

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
"OMGGGGGG! You guys will NOT believe what NEKO just discovered!!! \\(ΦдΦ)/ A really, really, really~~~~~ BIG secret!!"

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Done. This post is certainly going to create quite the discussion~

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Hoho, yesss~ The fans are starting to get hyped!

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
......

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
... This... This is not the best way to handle this news, isn't it? Xenon's probably going to be super mad if he sees this...

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
......

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
... Guess I'll delete it.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
However, what am I going to do now? I can't let her live here forever; that's just not possible...<br>
Now that I think about it, I practically know nothing about her situation. Why did I decide to bring her troubles on myself?<br>
Arrggghh~ So~ annoying! MeowBot, what do you think?

**[MeowBot]**<br>
*When you feel annoyed, it's also important to rely on friends meow~ If you don't mind, I can be your friend meow~*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
... It repeating the same dumb phrases a lot recently. Is it broken?

**[MeowBot]**<br>
*Love can make a girl even more beautiful meow~ Do you want to play a projection of Xenon meow?*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
W, what nonsense are you spewing!? Don't play it! I said no! UGH~ this guy is definitely broken! I'm taking you to a repair center tomorrow!

**[MeowBot]**<br>
*Tomorrow's weather: heavy rain. If you're going out, please remember to bring an umbrella meow~*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Lately, it seems to be raining every single day... Brings me back to the time when I first met him. The weather was like this back then too...

**Kenta**<br>
Big sister, who are you talking to?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
YIKES! That scared me!...... Sister is playing with the MeowBot.<br>
Why are you awake?

**Kenta**<br>
Thirsty.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
See, told you that you need to drink some water before going to bed. Come, I'll pour some water for you.

**Kenta**<br>
Don't want water. I want hot chocolate.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Ehh~? Ok, ok... can't help it. Don't tell sis Yukiko about this though!

**Kenta**<br>
Ah, big brother Xenon; was big sister watching this when I came in?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
WAHHHHH!! Stop stop stop!! I told you not to play it! The MeowBot really is broken! Ahahahaha! Big sister is going to get it fixed tomorrow!
