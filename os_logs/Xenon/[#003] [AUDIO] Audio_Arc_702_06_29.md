Come in.

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Xenon**<br>
I'm back.

**Davis**<br>
Finally free aren't you? Must be pretty tough down there right?

**Xenon**<br>
...Nightmare\-ishly tough.

**Davis**<br>
Can't help it, since all the top IT talents in Node are here at A.R.C. I feel bad for you, since this is not something you should be dealing with.

**Xenon**<br>
It's fine. I was the one who requested to be transferred down there in the first place. Though I didn't think it would be THAT bad.

**Davis**<br>
I know you just came back and may want some rest, but there's already a case waiting for you. So sorry about that. It's a request from the admins.

**Xenon**<br>
What? How come I've never heard about it?

**Davis**<br>
Originally, they planned to do it themselves, but their skills are just not good enough. So they came and asked for our help, specifically yours.

**Xenon**<br>
Specifically mine? Is it something that serious?

**Davis**<br>
Here's the report, take a look. It's a human trafficking group that operates around Node 03. Their "products" include all kinds of things: human test subjects, slaves, drugs..etc.They mainly do their business through cyTus. Only until recently when they expanded their market to Node 08 did the admins finally catch onto them. The admins tried pretty much every single method, but they never crack the code. Never seen a firewall like this.

**Xenon**<br>
... Certainly a very unusual encryption, interesting.<br>
However, judging from the report, I can already tell you that they didn't try every single method.

**Davis**<br>
Oh? you already have an idea? I expect no less from you.

**Xenon**<br>
For example, take a look here. When I set up this port, I added a honeypot here just for criminals like this. Those who attempted to break in through this port will think they've broken through cleanly, when in fact their actions have already been recorded.<br>
If they notice this, it shouldn't be hard for them to track down the signal's source.

**Davis**<br>
Ohhhh... so there is a design like this? Fantastic.

**Xenon**<br>
... Did you guys not read the reports I turn in?

**Davis**<br>
Eh? O, of course we did. It's just that it was a while ago... Ahem, if so, how long does it take to have some progress?

**Xenon**<br>
I'm sorry, but I need to meet with Mark and the other guys first to figure out the progress they had in the past few months. <br>
Hmmm... I should be able to track down the first signal source in about a week. Would that be ok?

**Davis**<br>
A week!? Of course. Do you know that the admins have been chasing this group for almost a year now?

**Xenon**<br>
... Let us handle the internet stuff from now on.

**Davis**<br>
I'll leave this case to you!

**Xenon**<br>
Ok. I'll go back to work.
