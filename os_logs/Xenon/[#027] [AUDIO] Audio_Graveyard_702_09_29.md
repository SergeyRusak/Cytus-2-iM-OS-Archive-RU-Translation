**Xenon**<br>
...... I told you not to buy so many flowers every time.

**Doris**<br>
This is the token of love between your father and me.

**Xenon**<br>
I know. I'm just saying that you bought too much. They always wither when we bring them home.

**Doris**<br>
And what's the problem with that? Your overly serious personality is really a carbon copy of your father.

**Xenon**<br>
... Really? Because I'm pretty sure that dad always used to say that I was nothing like him.

**Doris**<br>
That was when you're still young, right? You are becoming more and more like him... If he's here right now, he will definitely say the same thing too.

**Xenon**<br>
He is here. You're literally standing on him.

**JOE**<br>
*Sobs...*

**Doris**<br>
Eh? The person over there... Isn't that your friend JOE?

**Xenon**<br>
It really is him... What is that guy doing? You can set everything up first. I'll go say hi.
