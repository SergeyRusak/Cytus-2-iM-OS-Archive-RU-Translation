**Cherry**<br>
... Want some water?

**Xenon**<br>
......<br>
Yeah. Thanks.

**Cherry**<br>
......

**Xenon**<br>
......

**Xenon**<br>
Where's that guy?

**Cherry**<br>
In the next car. He said that it's too crowded here.

**Xenon**<br>
It's certainly quite uncomfortable. It's stuffy and narrow.

**Cherry**<br>
Can't help it. After all, this system is meant to transport goods, not people. Bear with it. It'll probably take a few hours before we arrive at the hub.

**Xenon**<br>
This thing sure does travel far.

**Cherry**<br>
This is my first time taking the return trip. Before this, I was responsible for picking up the cargo, and that's it.

**Xenon**<br>
Like that ridiculous transaction we just witnessed back there?

**Cherry**<br>
... Sorry; can only ask you to pretend that you didn't see anything.

**Xenon**<br>
Nope. I already placed a tracker inside and filed an anonymous report to the admins. The transaction is likely going to be intercepted.

**Cherry**<br>
......! You serious!? Wow, I didn't notice that at all.

**Xenon**<br>
... What concerned me more is the fact that you're still doing this kind of stuff, even after what happened...

**Cherry**<br>
... You also knew about that all this time, right? That's why you were avoiding me...

**Xenon**<br>
I really want to convince myself that I don't know, but that doesn't seem to be an option now.

**Cherry**<br>
......

**Xenon**<br>
They ask you to come and interfere with my actions, right?

**Cherry**<br>
Sigh... more or less... I don't want to lie.

**Xenon**<br>
Haha, then sorry to break it to you, but you kinda suck.

**Cherry**<br>
Hey, you can't blame me. You self\-imploded before I ever had the chance to interfere... Getting yourself arrested and locked up for pursuing the truth... That's so dumb...

**Xenon**<br>
You have a point... I still can't quite get over that.

**Cherry**<br>
Never imagine that you'd be defeated in the world of the internet.

**Xenon**<br>
No, the one that defeated me was not just that... the admins, A.R.C., and those thoughts in my mind, I failed to overcome any of these. I was too focused on the things I believed were the most important, yet ended up being toyed around by them...

**Cherry**<br>
What do you plan to do next? With you running away to Node 03, aren't you even further away from the truth now?

**Xenon**<br>
... I don't know. However, once I get there, I won't interfere with the organization's activity in Node 08 for quite some time. There's no need for you to keep following me anymore, right?

**Cherry**<br>
......!<br>
... Simon, although it's the organization's request that gave me the motive to contact you again, in all honesty... I... 

**Xenon**<br>
......

**Cherry**<br>
... Forget it. It's pointless to say these things now too...

**Xenon**<br>
......

**Cherry**<br>
......

**Xenon**<br>
"The real me"...

**Cherry**<br>
......?

**Xenon**<br>
"You can't accept this, can you? The real me"... You asked me that exact question in the past, right? Back then, I didn't really give you an answer either.

**Cherry**<br>
......

**Xenon**<br>
You've always used "the real me" to deny and run away from the Sherry we knew and spent time with, the Sherry who's cheerful, positive and strong\-willed. It's like you're trying to tell us that all of that was fake.

**Cherry**<br>
......

**Xenon**<br>
But to me, that's the "real" you. It's also the you I once liked. As with the you who has been doing all these "bad" things, that's also the real you. It's just one that I don't know much about yet... or it's just one that you don't want to let me know about. 

**Xenon**<br>
I am willing to believe that you have your own reasons for doing these things, but you'll have to prove it to me with your actions. After all, the one thing we both hate the most is a relationship that's all talk and no action, isn't it?

**Cherry**<br>
... Yes, you're right...

**Xenon**<br>
Although Neumann is "that" kind of person, the information he provided and his ability make me believe that there's still an opportunity for me to get closer to the truth. I will cooperate with his actions, for now at least... I feel like we two made a pretty great duo when investigating the Ã†sir incident. Judging by how much you distrust him, you'll help me, right?

**Cherry**<br>
......!<br>
... Yes! You're indeed the type that worries people a lot.

**Xenon**<br>
Let's start over from zero... Partners?

*\[High Five\]*

**Cherry**<br>
... Partners!

**Xenon**<br>
I'll go and check what he's doing in the next car. You must be exhausted. Get some rest.
