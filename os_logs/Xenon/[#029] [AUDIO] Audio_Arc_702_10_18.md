## Log Content
**Xenon**<br>
Said suspect has been arrested. The missing people he purchased are also all escorted back to where they're from. This case is more or less closed.<br>
That's it for the report on this event.

**Davis**<br>
Good work...  Must've been tough for you to dig up all this stuff.

**Xenon**<br>
Hmm... Well, I have my methods.

**Davis**<br>
You didn't cross the line, did you? Especially since you're also investigating the Æsir incident between all this.

**Xenon**<br>
... I said before that I'll deal with these things in my own way. The Administration Bureau didn't say anything about this either, right?

**Mark**<br>
......

**Davis**<br>
I know. I have no intention to deny what you did. In reality, you really did a phenomenal job. Looks like the position of IT security department head will certainly belong to you.

**Mark**<br>
The part on the buyer seems to come to a conclusion; but what about the seller?

**Xenon**<br>
...Whatever the Administration Bureau requested, I will give them the corresponding information.

**Mark**<br>
Going only 50% on your investigation; this is very unlike you.

**Xenon**<br>
......

**Mark**<br>
The Æsir incident, you used that, didn't you? The A.I. you've been using a lot recently.

**Xenon**<br>
Yes.

**Mark**<br>
That thing, even though it was written under an emergency situation, did it clear the official review process for use? Does the Administration Bureau know about this?

**Xenon**<br>
... You're right; they don't know about this yet. However, this version is almost identical to the previous one. I just added a few automatic functions.

**Davis**<br>
Ah, Mark is not wrong about that either. It's best that you send it in for a review, especially since you're using it to help solve the cases.

**Mark**<br>
It's better that you be more careful about it...

**Xenon**<br>
......?

**Mark**<br>
I feel like that thing is not exactly safe.

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Xenon**<br>
What's the deal with him? Too much stress?

**Davis**<br>
Sighs... how troublesome. <br>
Mark is also one of the candidates who have a very good chance of taking the department head position. Recently, the company has been promoting you a lot, so he is perhaps feeling a bit uneasy.

**Xenon**<br>
......<br>
I don't really care whether I can be the department head or not.

**Davis**<br>
No, I told you this before, right? You have the talent and the ability to judge things correctly. You must climb to a higher position and change the current situation.

**Xenon**<br>
You're giving me too much praise. Do not forget that I only have this job because of a mistake I made. Aren't you afraid that I'll rebel against you guys once I get the power to do so?

**Davis**<br>
... At the very least, I trust you.

**Xenon**<br>
... All things considered, I'll still talk to him sometime later. If not, I'm in an awkward spot myself too.
