*\[Doorbell\]*

**JOE**<br>
So you're here?

**Xenon**<br>
Yeah.

*\[Glass Sliding\]*

**JOE**<br>
Have a few drinks with me, will ya? I need to work myself up before I can talk.

**Xenon**<br>
Sure.

**JOE**<br>
... I thought you would want me to cut to the chase immediately.

**Xenon**<br>
Nothing wrong with a quick chat. It has been a while since we last did this; just us two, having a few drinks in a quiet Cafe after it has closed for the day. I don't dislike this.

**JOE**<br>
Ha, same here.

**Xenon**<br>
Besides, I don't mind a few drinks, as long as you don't act drunk and play dumb later.

**JOE**<br>
... Don't worry. I won't.

**Xenon**<br>
Relax, I know you very well. You're THE Joe Miller, the man who dodges questions like nobody's business. If someone like you said they are tackling a question head\-on, then it most definitely meant you've made up your mind to not dodge nor hide.

**JOE**<br>
... If we want to talk dodging questions, you and I are practically neck\-and\-neck, isn't it? On the surface, it seems like you're taking on a lot of things. However, whenever you encounter the key issues, you tend to just beat around the bush...

**Xenon**<br>
What are you talking about?

**JOE**<br>
Well, like your love life... Things in the past... And your family. After our reunion, the more I learn about you, the more I feel like you're basically using work as an escape to those things right now.

**Xenon**<br>
... Perhaps you're right. Today, after talking to you, I went back to my father's grave. I've been thinking about this question myself too... After his death, it seems like I've been constantly trying to become someone like him.

**JOE**<br>
Uncle Kyle eh... My previous image of him was that he is rigid about every little thing. On top of that, he didn't seem to like us very much, since we goofed around all day.

**Xenon**<br>
Haha, your image is on point. Even though he didn't forbid me from playing the guitar, he is still VERY mad when I dropped out of school to play in the band. I had so many arguments with my family back then, way too many to keep track of...

**Xenon**<br>
Despite all that, his passion and diligence for his job as a law enforcement agent, his drive for perfection on every minute detail, and his devotion for caring deeply about others; I've always had great respect for him in those regards.

**JOE**<br>
Uncle Kyle really was a great law enforcement agent. You rarely see people like him nowadays...

**Xenon**<br>
I've been constantly thinking; is there something I can do for a city that is now missing him... Yet I have no idea whether the things I am doing now is correct or not.<br>
Maybe I just don't have it in me to be as perfect as he was...

**JOE**<br>
Nobody's perfect though.

**Xenon**<br>
But, I'm like the farthest thing away from him. The things I did when I was still a teenager... I bet that even in his grave, he still hasn't forgiven me about it.

**JOE**<br>
You're referring to "that", right? Recently, the gossip channel on iM has been reporting on it too.

**Xenon**<br>
Sigh... So they're writing about it again? Remember the paparazzi people I mentioned before, the ones who kept harassing me? These are the ones.

**JOE**<br>
Lemme look it up... Oh, it's this one. Now that I'm reading it, it is indeed quite over\-the\-top.

**Xenon**<br>
... What's did it say?

**JOE**<br>
The mysterious renegade! The legendary hacker X", who robs the rich and gives to the poor! An underground punisher that lurks in the shadows of the internet!"... Pffft, hahahaha!

**Xenon**<br>
Shut up! God, that stuff is so cringeworthy...

**JOE**<br>
How so? Even now, I still find it to be really sick and awesome! I still remember the moment when I first learned that X is actually you. It was truly mindblowing...<br>
On top of that, you were just 14 or 15 years old when you were X. It's just like those anonymous masked heroes in comic books!

**Xenon**<br>
Awesome my a\*\*; I was this close to getting locked up... I only got pardoned because I agreed to join A.R.C.

**Xenon**<br>
Now that I think about it, I'm essentially the same as that guy...

**JOE**<br>
Hmm?

**Xenon**<br>
Nothing...<br>
These damn paparazzi... This stuff is all from ages ago, yet they still report it like some kind of big discovery. <br>
There should be a limit to how dumb they can be, but I guess that doesn't exist.

**JOE**<br>
Those things, are you not interested in doing it again? I can guarantee you if you do it in the current online environment, it's going to create an even bigger commotion. Besides, with your current skill level, nobody's gonna catch you.

**Xenon**<br>
Whenever I see these retards, that idea will still pop into my mind from time to time... But, it's not worth it, so I decide not to.<br>
After all, what I'm doing at A.R.C. now is more or less the same thing. Only difference is now it has a "legal" label on it. 

**JOE**<br>
Tch~ You could've made a s\*\*\* ton of money too.

**Xenon**<br>
... The stink of money in that brain of yours is definitely going to get you screwed someday.

**JOE**<br>
......

**Xenon**<br>
... What's wrong?

**JOE**<br>
Haha... That advice may have come a tad~ bit too late.

**Xenon**<br>
......

**JOE**<br>
Let's... cut to the chase. Follow me; I have something to show you.

**Xenon**<br>
... Okay.
