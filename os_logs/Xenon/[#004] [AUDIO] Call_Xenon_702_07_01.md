**JOE**<br>
Hey, it's me. Do you have a minute?

**Xenon**<br>
What's up? I'm still at work.

**JOE**<br>
Ah, I'm so sorry, but just one quick question.

**Xenon**<br>
Go ahead.

**JOE**<br>
Last year's Æsir\-FEST, you were there right?

**Xenon**<br>
Not in the venue. I was connected to the background system monitoring the data flow and the security records. Did something happen?

**JOE**<br>
Nah, it's just that several customers are on the verge of a brawl after an argument about Æsir\-FEST...

**Customer A**<br>
I said PAFF was on stage, the only guy who's not there is Æsir! There is no way a dedicated pro like PAFF would pull a No\-Show!

**Customer B**<br>
Oh really? Then tell me what songs she sang on stage? I don't remember a single one!

**Customer C**<br>
Gravity! She sang Gravity!

**Customer D**<br>
Robo\_head is the best!!

**JOE**<br>
... Something like that. I wasn't at the event, so I have no idea what they are talking about. 

**Xenon**<br>
.... If you ask me, I say it's gibberish spewed out by a bunch of drunkards. Don't call me for such pointless things. 

**JOE**<br>
Come on, don't be so cold. To be honest I'm quite curious about this event and I think you're a better source than these people. 

**Xenon**<br>
All I really remember that day is that there's a blackout in the venue, which resulted in Æsir not taking the stage and the venue going into complete chaos. Nothing else.

**JOE**<br>
It seems that the thing they are arguing about is whether or not the opening performances actually happened.

**Xenon**<br>
You mean ROBO and PAFF? I can't remember it too clearly, but I believe they did finish their performance as planned. 

**JOE**<br>
You guys heard it. Testimony from a staff member. Now stop arguing.

**Customer B**<br>
What!? Are you saying that cats are better than dogs!? I shall teach you a lesson!

*\[Bottles shatter\]*

**JOE**<br>
Ahhhhh... it seems that they have moved on to other topics.<br>
Hey! No fighting in the shop! Take it outside!

**Xenon**<br>
...I'm hanging up.

*[Call Ends]*
