**ConneR**<br>
Oh, Mr. Xenon. Have you listened to my album?

**Xenon**<br>
This is Library's record of connection errors from last month. Every single one of them has signs that they've been intercepted to your IP. Just what the hell are you doing?

**ConneR**<br>
... Are you questioning me? Quite frankly, I work in Library. It's normal for me to analyze these connection errors, am I right?

**Xenon**<br>
I'm the one in charge of internet security. As a non\-regular employee, your personal interception of these records is trespassing into my territory.

**ConneR**<br>
Hmmm? Then what can you do? Arrest me?

**Xenon**<br>
I have the right to report any suspicious activities to the higher\-ups.

**ConneR**<br>
Then what is your reason for not doing so, instead opting to come talk to me? Wasn't "following the rules" your way of doing things?

**Xenon**<br>
......

**ConneR**<br>
As someone who invented countless protocols and almost singlehandedly established the current internet's security, you couldn't figure out whether the connection errors are from internal or external sources. I'm a bit disappointed.

**Xenon**<br>
Are you saying that you have nothing to do with this?

**ConneR**<br>
No. In fact, it's the exact opposite. This is not just about me; it's about you, it's about everybody. The entire world is living in a giant deception.

**Xenon**<br>
What?

**ConneR**<br>
The current cyTus virtual internet is developed based on the ancient technology in Library combined with the original internet.

**Xenon**<br>
... And your point is?

**ConneR**<br>
Controlling technology that you have no idea how to actually control; won't that make you very nervous?

**Xenon**<br>
What the hell are you talking about?

**ConneR**<br>
From what I can tell, those security protocols weren't "invented"; they were "discovered", right? All you did was apply it to modern technology, yet A.R.C. is holding it like it was their invention. To me, that is no different than theft

**Xenon**<br>
... Internet security is not some kind of artwork. It exists so the people can use the internet under safe and fair conditions. I don't think there is a problem with that.

**ConneR**<br>
Indeed. "Conditions", "Rules", "Protocols". Having such arrogant limitations on a technology that you barely understand and acting as if you're some kind of god; that is the thing that makes me the most furious.

**Xenon**<br>
... I don't get what you are saying.

**ConneR**<br>
Pardon me, I've strayed a bit too far. All in all, I'm not the "mastermind" behind Library's connection errors. On a side note, I'm not the "Anonymous" who has been sending you mail either.<br>
Instead of wasting time on an old man like me, there are more important matters that you should be dealing with, Mr. Simon Jackson.
