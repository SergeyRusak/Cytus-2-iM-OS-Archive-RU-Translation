*\[Door Opens\]*

**Xenon**<br>
I'm home.

**Doris**<br>
Simon... Why are you all messed up!? Did you get in a fight again?

**Xenon**<br>
......

**Shannon**<br>
Brother...

**Doris**<br>
Who is it!? I'll file a report to the Academy tomorrow...

**Xenon**<br>
Forget it. I was the one who started the fight.

**Doris**<br>
Why?

**Xenon**<br>
They were bullying Shannon in the Academy.

**Shannon**<br>
Brother, I told you it's alright! They were just joking with me...

**Xenon**<br>
Throwing your drawings into the river, I don't think that's a very funny joke.

**Doris**<br>
Shannon... is that true? Why didn't you tell me about this?

**Shannon**<br>
It really is nothing serious. Please don't make a big deal out of it. I don't want to be embarrassed in class...

**Doris**<br>
Once your father comes back, I'll have a talk with him...

**Xenon**<br>
Forget about it. Compared to us, he cares more about the bad guys in the city... My guess is that he's not coming back today either.

**Doris**<br>
Simon...

**Xenon**<br>
Sorry, I don't mean to complain... He is doing the right thing.<br>
I'll go upstairs now. I'm sleeping soon, so no need to cook dinner for me.

**Doris**<br>
Simon...! Wait a minute!

**Shannon**<br>
Mom! Let me talk to him... I'll treat his wounds while I'm at it too.

*[→Signal Switches]*

**Xenon**<br>
... Oww.

**Shannon**<br>
Just bear with it a little...<br>
Brother, you... lost the fight, didn't you?

**Xenon**<br>
......

**Shannon**<br>
You really... don't have to do this kind of thing anymore. I don't want to see you get hurt again...

**Xenon**<br>
Those people, if you just ignore them, they will definitely become the bad guys dad is hunting down now. But I don't know any other way. I'm so damn useless. I can't even beat them in a fight... Owww...

**Shannon**<br>
Brother, you're looking down on yourself again. You're not useless at all. You're no.1 in the entire grade in Programming Language, and you're an amazing guitar player. Unlike me... all I do is draw some insects. Can't blame the people in my class for finding that disgusting...

**Xenon**<br>
Don't flatter me. My guitar skills are anything but good. Both mom and dad just treat it as loud noise.

**Shannon**<br>
At least I really like your music. Besides, they didn't stop you from playing despite the things they said. That in itself shows that they are not against it.<br>
Those people in my class, they more or less have issues within their own families. I think that at their core, they are still good people. They won't become those sorts of bad guys.

**Xenon**<br>
You're bullied this badly, yet you still think like that. These kinds of naive ideas will get you in serious danger someday...

**Shannon**<br>
Many people view cockroaches and spiders as disgusting pests for no particular reason other than their appearances and living habits. However, to cockroaches and spiders, they never had the right to choose. That's their only way of life. Even if they can't understand each other, they are still trying their best to live. I feel like it's the same for people, of how we treat one another. 

**Xenon**<br>
No, cockroaches are actually pretty disgusting... right? You're the weird one for not being scared of them...

*\[Slaps on patch\]*

**Xenon**<br>
Ouch! That hurt!

**Shannon**<br>
Last one! Hmph!<br>
All in all, I forbid you to pick fights with other people for my sake anymore. If I found out, I'll fill your room with cockroaches!

**Xenon**<br>
......

*\[Crash\]*

**Shannon**<br>
Waah!

**Student A**<br>
You've been getting real cocky, aren't you? Huh!? Did you think that would scare us?

**Shannon**<br>
......

**Student B**<br>
Ugh, the more I look at you, the grosser you get... Hey! Grab her and hold her down. Heard you really like bugs, is it? Then I'll pour some in your mouth to see if you really like them that much...

**Xenon**<br>
Stop it!

**Student C**<br>
You again? Did you not get enough of my punches last time?

*\[Loads Gun\]*

**Student A**<br>
Hey! He has a gun...!

**Student B**<br>
... He... hehe, so what? Do you know how to use it? Do you have the balls to shoot...?

**Xenon**<br>
... Umm...

**Shannon**<br>
Brother, no!

*\[Punch\]*

**Xenon**<br>
Blargh...!

**Student C**<br>
Imitating daddy and playing Mr. Police Officer? How cute.<br>
Ooh, this is a pretty nice gun... I think I'll take it, haha.

*\[Alarm\]*

**Student A**<br>
Yikes! It's his dad! RUN!

*\[Runs\]*

**Kyle**<br>
......<br>
Simon... give me back the gun.

**Xenon**<br>
......

**Kyle**<br>
Do you have any idea what you're doing?
