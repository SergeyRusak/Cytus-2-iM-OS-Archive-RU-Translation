**Man A**<br>
Hey, you done? Get on it.

**Man B**<br>
Are you stupid? How are we gonna do s\*\*\* with the security cameras uncovered?

**Man C**<br>
It's pointless anyway. That's the type that can record sounds.

**Man A**<br>
Whatever, nobody's gonna pay attention to a security camera in this damn place. Find the cargo first.

**Man C**<br>
Are you sure it's here?

**Man B**<br>
Yeah, Boss said that they put the cargo down here.

**Man A**<br>
Hey! Over here. Behind this thing, help me move it.

**Man C**<br>
Ok, let's go.

**Man B**<br>
Idiot! Check if the numbers are correct. If the buyer finds any problems when he picks it up at Cafe, we'll be erased in a snap.

**Man A**<br>
If that happens we'll just blame it on the Cafe's owner. We did it last time; it'll be fine.

**Man C**<br>
Hahaha! Man you're evil.

**Man A**<br>
Do I look like a nice guy? Stop yapping and start counting!

**Man C**<br>
13,14,15... 15 of them alright.

**Man A**<br>
Just what kind of device are these? I've never seen them before.

**Man C**<br>
Yeah seriously. I mean why can't the guy just use Black Coins? Man it's a pain in the ass.

**Man A**<br>
A while ago, some dude bought humans from us with humans. We had to conduct a full physical check up to see if the goods are injured or not. Don't want to do that ever again. 

**Man B**<br>
Stop babbling; there are cameras around here. If everything's ok, take it to Cafe. I'll call Boss.
