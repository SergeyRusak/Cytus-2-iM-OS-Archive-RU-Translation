**Xenon**<br>
What do you think of this intro?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
OHH! Sounds very cool!

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Then I will do it like this!

*\[Synthesizer\]*

**Xenon**<br>
Not bad, but why does it feel so... random?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
NEKO will patch it up when I get back!

*\[Eat Snacks\]*

**Xenon**<br>
Hey, I thought I told you not to eat snacks in here? Take it outside.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
NO! It's too stuffy outside!

**Xenon**<br>
I've turned on the AC, go outside.

*\[Door Opens\]*

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Hey! Let's go to Under Velvet to see a performance! There's a pretty awesome band today!

**Xenon**<br>
No, go by yourself.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Eh?

**Xenon**<br>
I'm returning to A.R.C. in a few days. I want to finish this song while I can still use this workshop.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
EHHHHHH!? You're going back to the skies!?

**Xenon**<br>
I've finished my support to the surface unit. I want to get back there as soon as possible.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
NEKO really likes here though. The equipment is better then what I have back home too. How about you give NEKO the key after you go back?

**Xenon**<br>
In your dreams. You done eating? Let's finish up the remaining parts.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
OKayyyy~
