**Agent M**<br>
So it finally came, eh...?

**Kyle**<br>
Yeah... they say that they're transferring you to the Intelligence Unit. My guess is that you've been doing your "homework" a bit too well.

**Agent M**<br>
Damn it... I knew there was definitely someone pulling the strings. I just never thought it'd be from that high up... This is trouble.

**Kyle**<br>
Judging from their attitude, they're not suspicious of me yet. You hand me the information and get yourself away from this right now.

**Agent M**<br>
No, we'll definitely get him in the next operation! For the past year, we've been catching a bunch of nobodies that has provided nothing in helping us solve the cases. You know yourself too, don't you!? Someone's carefully protecting the "Mediator".

**Kyle**<br>
Martin, don't be stubborn. You still have Delia and Nate to take care of. Don't lose your job for this.

**Agent M**<br>
... If we're talking about having a wife and children, aren't you the same, captain?

**Kyle**<br>
But our positions are different. In my position, I'm responsible for carrying on Captain Wood's ideals. 

**Agent M**<br>
Ha, haha... Aren't you a crafty one, captain? Only now do you bring up your superior rank...<br>
Then what about my feelings? What if I want to carry on some of that responsibility as well? Are those feelings not important?

**Kyle**<br>
... Of course not...

**Agent M**<br>
Two weeks... no! Ten days, figure out a way to get me ten more days. I'll definitely get you the guy.

**Kyle**<br>
... What are you trying to do? Don't act on your own.

**Agent M**<br>
Ten days.

**Kyle**<br>
Hey! Martin!<br>
Sigh...

*[→Audio\_Graveyard\_693\_10\_15]*

**Agent**<br>
Let us mourn for this brave agent. His bravery will forever remain in our hearts. Salute!

**Nate**<br>
*\*Sobs\**... Dad...

**Xenon**<br>
... Smoke?

**Nate**<br>
... I have my own. Yikes, you're still smoking those crappy cigarettes...?

**Xenon**<br>
Nate... your dad was a good agent. I'm sorry we lost him.

**Nate**<br>
No, we didn't lose him. He will always be in my heart, and I will fill his vacant position.

**Xenon**<br>
You're a lot stronger than I thought. I can rest assured now.

**Nate**<br>
Yeah... can't say the same about my mom though. Back then, when my dad first decided to join the Serious Crime Unit, they got into a big argument... Better not let her see your dad; she's gonna go insane...

**Xenon**<br>
... Got it. Speaking of my dad, I haven't seen him since the funeral. He probably took the loss pretty hard too... Uncle Martin was his most trustworthy subordinate.

**Nate**<br>
I'm probably gonna be alright. You should go stay by his side.

**Xenon**<br>
Nah... To be honest, I haven't had a proper conversation with him for quite some time as well. Even if I were going to console him, I wouldn't have any idea how.

**Nate**<br>
Haha, that's right. You're smack\-dab in the middle of your rebellious phrase...<br>
I advise you to treasure every opportunity you spend together with your family. Don't end up like me.

**Xenon**<br>
......

**Nate**<br>
Ah, sorry... I shouldn't have said those things...

**Xenon**<br>
No, I understand. Even though I don't know how to communicate with him, my respect for him never changed. Everything he did... I admire it all, to be honest——But the way he does things can be just so...

**Nate**<br>
Yeah, really serious and proper. That's the type of person your dad is, and that's why he has such a strong sense of justice. I believe this is something worth learning from.

**Xenon**<br>
Yeah... I agree.<br>
It's about time I get going. Say hi to your mom for me.

**Nate**<br>
Simon...

**Xenon**<br>
Hmm?

**Nate**<br>
Although I'm already a Law Enforcement Agent trainee, my dad never talked to me about his work. I want to know... who killed him.

**Xenon**<br>
... What do you mean?

**Nate**<br>
I heard that he died because he broke the rules to privately investigate a smuggling group... The higher\-ups seem to have a hand in all this as well.

**Xenon**<br>
......

**Nate**<br>
It's unlikely that he's the only one pursuing this case. I think that your dad must know about it. If you can...

**Xenon**<br>
... I told you before; I haven't talked to my dad for a long time. You want me to all of a sudden ask him about that? You're asking the impossible.

**Nate**<br>
No, not by asking. What if you investigate it? Let "X"...

**Xenon**<br>
... Don't mention that name again. Didn't we agree on that?

**Nate**<br>
... My bad. Forget that I ever said these things.

**Xenon**<br>
I will. Nate, what you should be is an agent of the law, not an agent of revenge.

**Nate**<br>
Haha... Never thought I would get lectured by a brat like you one day.<br>
... I know.
