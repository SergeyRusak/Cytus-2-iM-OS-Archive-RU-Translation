**Cherry**<br>
Father! What happened!?

**ER Doctor**<br>
I don't know. Some people found him collapsed on side of the road covered in blood.

**Xenon**<br>
Gunshot wound......?

**Cherry**<br>
......

**ER Doctor**<br>
I'm sorry, Miss Pauline. Your father has already lost too much blood. We need to do an emergency blood transfusion right away, but we don't have any AB type blood in our storage that matches his condition...

**Xenon**<br>
My blood type is AB!

**ER Doctor**<br>
Really!? Are you willing to undergo a blood transfusion checkup...

**Xenon**<br>
Whatever! Let's get on it!

**Cherry**<br>
*\*sob\*... \*sob\*...*

**Xenon**<br>
The doctor said it's nothing major, it'll be alright.

**Cherry**<br>
Okay…

**ER Nurse**<br>
Miss Pauline, you may visit your father now. You've got 10 minutes.

**Cherry**<br>
Thank you!

**ER Nurse**<br>
Sir, we're sorry. Only family members are allowed.

**Cherry**<br>
He's the one who gave the blood!

**Xenon**<br>
Sherry, it's okay. I'm still feeling a bit dizzy. I'll just rest here. Go on.

**Cherry**<br>
Okay!

**Xenon**<br>
……

**[News]**<br>
*...... Earlier today, a male agent who had sustained an injury was found lying here. By the time paramedics rushed to the scene, there were already no signs of life.*

**Xenon**<br>
......?

**[News]**<br>
*By his side is a young girl who is in complete shock. She appears to have sustained no physical injuries, but her emotional state is very unstable. It's currently suspected that this girl may be the agent's daughter.*

**Xenon**<br>
!?

**[News]**<br>
*The Administration Bureau is still in the process of clarifying the... Yes? Got it.<br>
New information just came in. The agent who died in the line of duty was named Kyle Jackson. The girl by his side is his daughter, Shannon Jackson......*

**Xenon**<br>
Dad!? Shannon!?

*[»»»Fast Forward»»»]*

**Cherry**<br>
... Simon? Where did he go?

*[→Audio\_Hospital01\_696\_05\_17]*

**Jacob**<br>
I'm sorry, we're still unable to determine the reason behind your daughter's unique symptoms. She has suffered no brain damage, but her brain is just unable to disconnect with the virtual internet. She may need to remain in the hospital for a while so we can observe her symptoms.

**Doris**<br>
*\*sob\*... \*sob\*...*

**Xenon**<br>
……

**Jacob**<br>
I'm very sorry about what happened to Mr. Jackson... he was a good agent.

**Doris**<br>
Thank you. That's what everybody says...

*[→Audio\_Hospital01\_696\_09\_15]*

**Doris**<br>
Doctor.

**Jacob**<br>
Good morning.

**Xenon**<br>
Has there been any progress?

**Jacob**<br>
Yes, as for Shannon's condition, we've designated it "Virtual\-internet Related Post Traumatic Stress Disorder", or "VR PTSD" for short. We suspect that the symptoms are residual effects of excessive emotional trauma clashing with the virtual Internet.

**Xenon**<br>
……

**Jacob**<br>
I'm sorry. As of now, I can't allow you two to see her. Anything that can arouse her memory could potentially cause her to have an emotional breakdown. We're currently still doing our best to look for things she could come in contact with in her daily life that can evoke a normal reaction. The information you provided us has been a big help.

**Xenon**<br>
Have you discovered anything?

**Jacob**<br>
Yes. We've discovered that when she hears Simon's music, her emotions will be significantly more stabilized. She's able to maintain a stable emotional state even without the use of sedatives.

**Xenon**<br>
If possible, let me play for her in person. Maybe that can get more of a reaction out of her.

**Jacob**<br>
No. Even if she so much as sees your faces, she will...

**Xenon**<br>
... So it's alright as long as I don't show my face?
