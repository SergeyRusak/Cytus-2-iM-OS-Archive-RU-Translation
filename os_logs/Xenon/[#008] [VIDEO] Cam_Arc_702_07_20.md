**ConneR**<br>
Greetings. I believe this is our first meeting. I'm Colin Neumann Jr.

**Xenon**<br>
I'm Simon from the IT department. We received a report that there is a problem with your system.

**ConneR**<br>
Master Simon, pleased to meet you. The system kept overheating when I'm trying to process this piece of data. I would be quite troubled if this issue can't be solved.

**Xenon**<br>
Understood. Let me take a look; this may take a while.

**ConneR**<br>
Of course.

**Xenon**<br>
......

**ConneR**<br>
......

**ConneR**<br>
By the way, can you give me access to cyTus's virtual connection security reports? I heard that you were the person who established the majority of the security protocols?

**Xenon**<br>
...I can't give you access to anything without the higher\-ups agreeing to it first.

**ConneR**<br>
Is that so? What a pity. My job would be much easier if I have those documents.

**Xenon**<br>
... Your job should have nothing to do with those documents, right?

**ConneR**<br>
" Assist Library in the research and development of technology from ancient cultures" that's my job description. I believe there is no conflict between my job and me having those documents.

**Xenon**<br>
... I have improved the algorithms for you. The overheating should not occur anymore.

**ConneR**<br>
Ahh, it is running fine now. My sincerest gratitude.

**Xenon**<br>
Also, the amount of data you are processing is way too much. The estimated data flow for every project will be sent to our department. You're a non\-regular employee; best you not do anything that is not related to the company.

**ConneR**<br>
You are very sharp indeed, but don't worry. All my actions are part of A.R.C.'s requirements.

**Xenon**<br>
I hope so. If there aren't any more problems, I will leave now.

**ConneR**<br>
Of course. It's a great pleasure meeting you.
