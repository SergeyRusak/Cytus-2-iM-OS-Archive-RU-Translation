**Andrew**<br>
And that's it for the Serious Crime Unit's operation report. Meeting's over. Jackson, you stay. I have something to tell you.

**Kyle**<br>
......

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

**Andrew**<br>
So the gun was stolen by Simon?

**Kyle**<br>
Yes. I've already taught him a serious lesson. He is now grounded.

**Andrew**<br>
Good thing it didn't become a major issue.<br>
Jackson, of all my subordinates, you're the one I think most highly of. Don't let this kind of minor mishap get in the way again. Many people are jealous of you, and they are more than happy to see you fail so they can climb up themselves.

**Kyle**<br>
Captain, those students who were bullying my children in the Academy, I saw their faces.

**Andrew**<br>
... We've discussed this already. Student issues are the responsibility of the Juvenile Crime Unit. We have bigger cases to deal with on our hands.

**Kyle**<br>
I don't understand. This is something we could've stopped. Why are we pushing it away just because it belongs to a different unit?

**Andrew**<br>
......<br>
I'm retiring in a few years. Before that, I'll do whatever I can to make you the successor of my position. Listen closely, even if it's someone from the Administration Bureau, as long as it's not a member of our unit, do not trust them easily. If you can't understand this, you'll never do well in this job.

**Kyle**<br>
......

**Andrew**<br>
... I know you're very concerned about your kids. However, you're the only person who has a legitimate chance of bringing "Law Enforcement" back on the right tracks. As with the Academy's students, I'll ask the Juvenile Crime Unit to handle them. You just need to focus on completing the Serious Crime Unit's missions. That's the most efficient way for you to earn credits. 

**Kyle**<br>
......

**Andrew**<br>
Time's up. You should meet up with the others.<br>
One more thing... Isn't it better for you to directly show your children that you really do care about them? They'll never feel how much you care about them if you keep a stern face in front of them all the time... This is coming from someone who also has a family himself.

**Kyle**<br>
... Understood.

*[→Audio\_AB08\_688\_05\_19]*

**Agent A**<br>
Walk forward! Get in!

**Student A**<br>
I get it! Stop pushing me, you bum!

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Kyle**<br>
... It's that student.

**Agent B**<br>
Hey, SCU guy, what do you want? You have no business here.

**Kyle**<br>
That student is the main culprit behind my daughter's bullying at the Academy...<br>
Don't tell me... did my daughter...?

**Agent A**<br>
I have no idea what you're talking about. He's under arrest for a busted drugs transaction.

**Kyle**<br>
Drugs transaction?

**Agent B**<br>
An anonymous connection sent a series of transaction records to our system. We traced that connection, found the address and this brat... Alex's the name, right? Got busted by us right on the site.

**Agent A**<br>
Hey, what are you doing spilling the beans to this guy?<br>
In short, this is a pretty major catch. You SCU folks and your arrogant a\*\*es better watch out cause you aren't the only ones solving cases.

**Kyle**<br>
... Did you reverse track that connection? Following a tip with unknown origins is way too risky! Besides, how did that anonymous person manage to hack into your system?

**Agent A**<br>
... Shut up. You don't get to tell us how to do OUR jobs! Jackson, I know you're cocky, but this is not over. When all is said and done, the one who climbs to the top may not be you. Remember that well.

**Kyle**<br>
......

*[→Signal Switches]*

**Agent A**<br>
Alex Flynn, do you know why you are here?

**Student A**<br>
Huh? How would I know?

**Agent A**<br>
Stop pretending. An anonymous tip has provided us with records of you selling drugs on the dark web. The evidence is all here.

**Student A**<br>
Ha, you guys think this tiny bit of evidence is enough to arrest me?

**Agent A**<br>
You do have a point. This certainly isn't enough. Information from the dark web doesn't qualify as valid evidence in front of a jury. Therefore, we've prepared some other exhibits. 

*\[Places item\]*

**Student A**<br>
...!?

**Agent A**<br>
Heard you had a good time messing around with classmates when you were at the Academy. Remember anything about this little box?

**Student A**<br>
Hey, what are you gonna do? Take that thing away!

**Agent A**<br>
What's the matter? This item belongs to your, right?<br>
You took this box and told your mates to catch some bugs. You then used them to bully a female classmate, correct?

**Student A**<br>
......

**Agent A**<br>
Although there were no fingerprints on the box, we were able to analyze it and discovered traces of the "goods" you sold.<br>
So? Remember anything now?

**Student A**<br>
... What the f\*\*\* does that have to do with me...

**Agent A**<br>
Still can't remember anything, can you? Then perhaps I should put those bugs back inside to remind you of the scenario.

**Student A**<br>
WAAH! Don't come near me!

**Agent A**<br>
Looks like they weren't kidding when they said you really hate insects...<br>
A good kid shouldn't bully a classmate for this kind of reason, especially someone with a criminal record like you.<br>
From the looks of it, your dad is lowly scum himself too. So? What do you think? Plead guilty now and you can have a touching reunion with him in the restricted area. 

**Student A**<br>
N... no! WAAAAHHHHHH!!
