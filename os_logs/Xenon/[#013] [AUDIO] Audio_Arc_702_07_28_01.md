**Davis**<br>
Next, we'll talk about the cases where music\-related connections cause users to experience physical discomfort. Simon, you're in charge of this.

**Xenon**<br>
Yes. Data shows that in addition to yesterday's incident, reports of physical discomfort during virtual connection have increased significantly. The increase started around half a year ago, after the event known as Æsir\-FEST. Symptoms include headaches, dizziness and nausea. A.R.C.'s medical department has not yet identified the reason for these symptoms.

**Davis**<br>
We need to talk about this. Public pressure is now at a breaking point after yesterday's incident. The higher\-ups are starting to panic. We have made an announcement to advise users to use traditional connection instead of the ID chips. However, that's only a temporary solution; we need to find the real reason behind all this as soon as possible.

**Xenon**<br>
Right now, I've eliminated the possibilities of hacker and internet virus. The reason is that during those incidents, we did not detect any abnormal active connections 

**Mark**<br>
Then is it because of the user's personal health conditions?

**Davis**<br>
If it's personal health, the circumstances where the symptoms appear should be a lot simpler. 

**Xenon**<br>
Now here's the key point. Remember the Æsir\-FEST I just mentioned? In a bizarre coincidence, it turns out that every single person who displayed the symptoms was a participant of Æsir\-FEST. 

**Davis**<br>
I recall that you were the one monitoring that event, right? Did you sense anything abnormal back then?

**Xenon**<br>
There was a sudden blackout, but I don't remember any error messages about the internet. Also, Æsir didn't show up for that event and has been missing since then. I find that very suspicious. If that event really is the beginning of everything, I think we should ask the admins to search for this person.

**Mark**<br>
Æsir only does things through the internet. There's no way the admins can do anything about him.

**Xenon**<br>
Then I'll do it myself. It shouldn't be that hard to locate where his activity records originate from.  

**Davis**<br>
Without authorization from the admins, you can't do anything to the guy even if you locate him. 

**Xenon**<br>
They had us handle internet security. Shouldn't they give us a certain degree of power to maintain that?

**Davis**<br>
About that, it has been a complete stalemate between the admins and me. I know their attitude on this too well.

**Xenon**<br>
So what? We just sit here, wait for more victims to appear and let the company's reputation go completely down the drain?

**Davis**<br>
Calm down. Right now we are not 100% sure that Æsir has anything to do with this. However, the direction you pointed to is very believable. I'll talk with the admins to see if we can get something. You should investigate more on this guy first. 

**Xenon**<br>
... Understood.

**Davis**<br>
Then we move on to the next topic: overall security.
