**Andrew**<br>
This is the criminal activity we're pursuing this time.

*\[Data projection\]*

**Andrew**<br>
A group of organizations that mainly operates in Node 03. Through some not\-yet recreated or abandoned tunnels beneath the Nodes, they conduct a smuggling business. They have an organization as their respondent in Node 08 as well. As of now, the most suspicious one is obviously "Baro", a name everyone must be very familiar with. As you can see here, they're the ones who collect all the direct profits at the end of these transactions.

**Kyle**<br>
A criminal group from 03 has extended its influence all the way here...?

**Andrew**<br>
That's right. Due to the extremely uncooperative attitude of 03's Administration Bureau, that area has basically become a lawless place. That's none of our business, but having that situation invade 08 will create quite a headache for us.

**Agent M**<br>
All these sporadic incidents... Can't believe we never found out about them before...

**Andrew**<br>
No, this is a mistake on my behalf. The Ando family has always kept a balance among the underground organizations, a balance that doesn't require us to resort to violence. After all, we don't want a conflict between the two sides to disturb civilians. However, relying on the underground society itself is a mistake. Someone in Baro wants to destroy this peace, which is why they're constant taunting the Administration Bureau like this. Right now, we can no longer ignore them.

**Kyle**<br>
This data on their profits... They didn't even bother hiding them. This is clearly a declaration of war against us...

**Andrew**<br>
In short, this data contains all the suspicious figures reported by my "informant". This includes buyers, sellers, missing people and other related witnesses. Jackson, I'll have you in charge of this case. Do you accept this?

**Kyle**<br>
Have me in charge? Captain, what about you?

**Andrew**<br>
I have some other jobs to deal with this month... It's a case about some crucial encrypted data being stolen from A.R.C.'s servers. However, that should be ending soon. Once I'm done with that, I'll return to join the investigation.

**Kyle**<br>
... Understood. With Martin and I, as well as the members we have right now, it should be enough.

**Agent M**<br>
Leave it to us, captain.

**Andrew**<br>
With you two together on the job, no need for me to worry.<br>
Martin, your son... Nate, he's currently a trainee, right? Judging by his grades, he'll be an excellent Law Enforcement Agent like you in no time.

**Agent M**<br>
I'm flattered, captain. That brat still has a lot to learn.

**Andrew**<br>
Jackson, perhaps this is the case to take down Baro once and for all. If so, you'll move one step closer to my position. Do your best.

**Kyle**<br>
Yes, Sir!

**Andrew**<br>
Right... I know I shouldn't say this in a meeting, but the Serious Crime Unit members present here are the comrades I trust most... Regarding this investigation, try your best to let other people in the Bureau know. I suspect that these smuggling and trafficking transactions were able to go through because of an accomplice within the Administration Bureau.

**Agent M**<br>
......!!

**Andrew**<br>
I believe that said accomplice is definitely not present in this room. However, I suggest you be careful yourselves. The people from other units may not be as trustworthy...

**Kyle**<br>
... Understood.

*\[Door Knock\]*

**Agent M**<br>
Captain, not done with work yet?

**Kyle**<br>
The criminals won't be so considerate as to take a break when we do... Also, when we're in private, don't call me captain. Just refer to me as you normally do.

**Agent M**<br>
Sorry, no can do. We're still in the Bureau. Besides, aren't you supposed to get used to it by now?

**Kyle**<br>
It has been two years since Captain Wood was killed in action... No, since we took over this case. Yet we still haven't had any major breakthroughs. I'm too ashamed to even face Captain Wood, much less get used to this...

**Agent M**<br>
Don't say that. After you took over the position, the crime rate is far lower than what it previously was.

**Kyle**<br>
But as a result, I created more enemies, be it on the outside or on the inside.

**Agent M**<br>
Yeah, yeah. You give yourself way too much pressure. Come on, go grab a drink.

**Kyle**<br>
Now? Let me put these files...

**Agent M**<br>
I'll handle it for you! Go!

**Kyle**<br>
Hey, don't drag me...

*[→Audio\_HNote\_692\_08\_12]*

**Kyle**<br>
... Is this the type of place you like to go to after work? Guess you're no different than the other folks in the Bureau.

**Agent M**<br>
What do you mean "this type of place"? The resident singers here are the best! Especially the female singer making a guest appearance today, you better listen closely!

*\[Singing\]*

**Kyle**<br>
......!<br>
Ah\~ this certainly is a beautiful voice...

**Helena**<br>
Thank you. That's my little sister.

**Agent M**<br>
Oh! Helena, another night shift today? Must be tough.

**Helena**<br>
You too, agent Martin. Thank you for coming so often\~ Here, it's a treat. Don't tell the owner!<br>
Then, I'll leave you two to it. Enjoy!

**Agent M**<br>
Thanks!<br>
Kyle, to be honest, I brought you here because there's something I want to tell you. Something that's best not talked about inside the Bureau.

**Kyle**<br>
... What is it? Being so serious all of a sudden.

**Agent M**<br>
Here is some information I got through some of my connections. Take a look first.

![xos4101.png](./attachments/xos4101.png)
**Kyle**<br>
Paper documents...?<br>
......! These are... Hey, did you file an application for all this?

**Agent M**<br>
Don't be silly. Following that system will get you nothing but jack s\*\*\*.<br>
Captain Wood was indeed correct. Those Baro bastards in charge of smuggling have an accomplice within the Bureau. Thus, I decided to meet you in private to discuss this... Are you going to report me?

**Kyle**<br>
Course not, great job! With this information, we finally have a clear direction! Who's the one in this photo...?

**Agent M**<br>
Don't know yet. The computer analysis couldn't figure out the identity due to the angle. Despite that, these pieces of evidence all point to the fact that this person is their "Mediator". Judging by how familiar he is with the underground tunnels, I presume that this person probably worked there in the past.

**Kyle**<br>
This means the search range is now reduced significantly! As long as we can get a list of former employees...

**Agent M**<br>
We'll be able to catch the big one using this guy.
