**JOE**<br>
Oh! Simon! You're here.

**Xenon**<br>
The usual stuff.

**JOE**<br>
Got it, one bottle of milk. But seriously, when are you going to start drinking some booze? You're already 26.

**Xenon**<br>
Age is not the issue.

**JOE**<br>
Don't you have to socialize with your bosses up there? I mean that's a thing right?

**Xenon**<br>
My manager and my colleagues are all a bunch of geeks. We have almost no interaction outside of work.

**JOE**<br>
Jasus! Don't you get bored? I'll probably be bored to death under those circumstances!

**Xenon**<br>
I like my job quite a bit, so it's no big deal.

**Xenon**<br>
But now that I think about it, I really only chat with other people when I'm here.

**JOE**<br>
I call BS! I know for a fact that recently you're very close to a particular streamer girl!

**Xenon**<br>
... She is 6 years younger than me. She's just a little sister to me.

**JOE**<br>
Age is not the issue.

**Xenon**<br>
... Shut up.

**JOE**<br>
Bwahaha! What's the matter? I can give you hand if you really want me to!

**Xenon**<br>
I will never be in a romantic relationship again. You of all people should know that, right? Let's change the topic.

**JOE**<br>
Haha! Okay, okay. By the way, are you going back to A.R.C. tomorrow?

**Xenon**<br>
Yes, finally. Those worthless ITs at the Administration Bureau are driving me nuts.

**JOE**<br>
Hahaha! Good work my man! As a celebration, shouldn't you break the mold and try some alcohol?

*\[Makes Cocktail\]*

**Xenon**<br>
... What is this?

**JOE**<br>
Stairway to Heaven. Cheers!

**Xenon**<br>
... Alright.

*\[Cheers\]*

**Xenon**<br>
... Tastes terrible.
