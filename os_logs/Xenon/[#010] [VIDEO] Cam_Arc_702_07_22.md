**Xenon**<br>
I tracked down the IP address of the anonymous mail I received a while ago.

**Mark**<br>
Hmm?

**Xenon**<br>
The address is within A.R.C.

**Mark**<br>
So who is it?

**Xenon**<br>
No matter how hard I try I can only get the IP address. Haven't run into an encryption this tough in a long time.

**Mark**<br>
Does our company really have someone like that?

**Xenon**<br>
Can't say it's impossible. People that come to work at A.R.C. are all extremely skilled. 

**Mark**<br>
So this guy chose to hide his abilities, yet writes a letter like this to challenge you?

**Xenon**<br>
The only possible candidate I can think of right now is the new advisor. I met him a few days ago.

**Mark**<br>
Oh. How was it?

**Xenon**<br>
He's a complete a\-hole. However, I might have to admit that he indeed has something special, or else the company would not give a non\-regular employee access to so many things. 

**Mark**<br>
He still thinks it's not enough though.

**Xenon**<br>
Regardless I will keep a keen eye on him. He is not someone you should overlook.

**Mark**<br>
OK.
