**Davis**<br>
The admins are almost here. Where's Simon?

**Mark**<br>
In his room.

**Davis**<br>
What's the matter? You look kind of pale.

**Mark**<br>
... Similar to Simon, I don't really like the Administration Bureau people.

**Davis**<br>
Relax. It should be just one or two investigation agents.

*\[Door Opens\]*

**Agent A**<br>
Starting now, we will carry out the arrest of Simon Jackson.

**Mark**<br>
... Armed forces and drones!? Isn't it supposed to be just a simple interrogation?

**Davis**<br>
Arrest!? Wait! If this whole group of people barged in, you'll disturb other employees!

**Agent B**<br>
The Æsir attack incident is labeled as security level A. The evidence you provided is already enough for Simon Jackson to be identified and forcefully arrested as a suspect for the case. Please stay out of the way.

**Mark**<br>
......

*\[Door Breaks\]*

**Agent A**<br>
FREEZE!

**Xenon**<br>
......!?

*\[Things crashing\]*

**Agent B**<br>
Where do you think you're running!? Stay down! You're under arrest!

**[Enforcer Drones]**<br>
*Beginning arrest of identified suspect: civilian Simon Jackson. Please cooperate.*

**Xenon**<br>
...... Did I do something?

**Agent A**<br>
You want to play dumb? If you didn't do anything, why did you run?

**Xenon**<br>
... Instinctive reaction. It couldn't be that, can it? A while ago, I hacked into the server of your HR department to look for some info... Is it really necessary to deploy armed forces for such a minor incident?

**[Enforcer Drones]**<br>
*Civilian Simon Jackson, you are under arrest for your crimes as "Prime suspect of the Æsir large\-scale internet attack incident". *

**Xenon**<br>
......!

**Xenon**<br>
......

**Agent A**<br>
Oh, not resisting anymore? So you admit it?

**Davis**<br>
Simon...... Was it really you......?

**Xenon**<br>
Mark's the one who uncovered this, right?

**Mark**<br>
......

**Agent A**<br>
If you have something to say, you can talk once we get back to the Bureau. Now move!
