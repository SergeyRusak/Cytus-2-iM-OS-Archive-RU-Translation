Hello.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Hi HI! I'm NEKO!

**Xenon**<br>
I saw your name on the call. What's up?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
My internet became weird all of a sudden. Do something about it!

**Xenon**<br>
... Call customer service.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
NO! Last time I called them their attitude was terrible!

**Xenon**<br>
You're the one to blame for the issue last time... wait, did you just say your internet became weird? Are you using the ID chip to access the internet?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
I'm using the PC. The connection speed just suddenly dropped.

**Xenon**<br>
Good. If possible, stay away from using ID chips to access the internet. For now at least. 

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Eh? Why?

**Xenon**<br>
Did you forget about the PAFF Incident? Most of the victims accessed the event through ID chips. 

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
EHH!? So that's really a thing? I always thought it was just fake news!

**Xenon**<br>
Fake news my ass. Right now the entire department is investigating this. All in all, stay away from the internet for a while. 

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Negative! NEKO will die if she can't use the internet!

**Xenon**<br>
Then at least switch to traditional connection.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Hmmmm\~? Are you worried about NEKO?

**Xenon**<br>
...It's normal for an A.R.C. employee to worry about the user's safety.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
Haha, you're blushing!

**Xenon**<br>
... I'm hanging up.

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
EHH! You still haven't fixed my connection speed problem!

**Xenon**<br>
Call customer service.
