**Student A**<br>
Shannon, bye\-bye\~ See you next week.

**Shannon**<br>
Okay! See you next week!

*\[Engine sounds\]*

**Kyle**<br>
Shannon, want a ride?

**Shannon**<br>
Dad!? What are you doing here!?

*[→Signal Switches]*

**Shannon**<br>
Jeez, stop picking me up with the admins' car!<br>
My classmates all laugh at me for this.

**Kyle**<br>
I'm worried about you. The security in this area has been getting worse and worse too...

**Shannon**<br>
Isn't that your fault, for not doing your job well?

**Kyle**<br>
Haha... well, that I am guilty of.<br>
However, I'm relieved to see that you have many friends at school.

**Shannon**<br>
I'm already far passed that age where I get bullied all the time. Dad, don't just remember things from that time. I'm not a child anymore.

**Kyle**<br>
Speaking of which, things back then were truly... got to thank Simon for that. Do you still see him?

**Shannon**<br>
Yep! He's doing great. He often invites me to see their practices or performances. Their band is really awesome, and all the members are really fun people! Especially Sis Cherry! It looks like their da... ah!

**Kyle**<br>
Da...?

**Shannon**<br>
N... Nothing! All in all, dad should go listen to their next performance too!

**Kyle**<br>
I don't have that kind of time... Besides, isn't it just some noisy music?

*\[Play Music\]*

**Kyle**<br>
Hey! What are you doing!?

**Shannon**<br>
Ah, what a coincidence. I turn on your music player and the first song just so happens to be "noisy music"\~

**Kyle**<br>
......

**Shannon**<br>
If it wasn't for the guitar you gifted him, he wouldn't have gone into music in the first place. Say, isn't it about time you two stop giving each other the silent treatment?

**Kyle**<br>
... Hmph, if he wants to come back, he can come back whenever he wants.

**Shannon**<br>
Here we go again\~ Who would want to live with you if you have that attitude...

*\[Brakes\]*

**Shannon**<br>
Wahh! W\-what's the matter!?

**Kyle**<br>
......!!<br>
Shannon... get out the car.

**Shannon**<br>
......?

**Kyle**<br>
It's that guy...

**Shannon**<br>
Dad...?

**Kyle**<br>
Get out the car, now! Listen carefully; don't do anything else, go straight back home, got it?

*\[Car Door\]*

**Shannon**<br>
