**Xenon**<br>
Having lunch now?

**Mark**<br>
Uh\-huh.

**Xenon**<br>
All the non\-human errors have been fixed. When you finish eating, take this report to Davis.

**Mark**<br>
Uh\-huh.

**Xenon**<br>
......

**Mark**<br>
......

**Xenon**<br>
Ah, there's another thing. Last night I received this mail in my personal inbox. Did you send it?

**Mark**<br>
... I don't have a reason to send you a report anonymously.

**Xenon**<br>
Since it's a record of cyTus errors, I thought it was some extra info you found.

**Mark**<br>
The format of this report is exactly the same as the one you wrote for the security loops. Is this a memo for yourself?

**Xenon**<br>
No, it's not. I don't remember writing anything like this. I've asked other members as well; none of them wrote it.

**Mark**<br>
Only someone within A.R.C. can write a report like this. If it's from outside the A.R.C., things can get interesting.

**Xenon**<br>
... I don't think that's possible. Regardless, I'll try and track down the IP address of the signal. If it's from a public area, I might have to tell Davis about this.

**Mark**<br>
Uh\-huh. Tracking is not exactly my specialty, so I can't help.<br>
But I'm curious about the results. If you got something, tell me.

**Xenon**<br>
It's quite rare that you are interested in something other than your work.

**Mark**<br>
You're the person that almost singlehandedly created the cyTus internet security system; the very reason that the security is at its current strength. If there exists someone besides me that can crack the firewall program you wrote, I would be very interested.

**Xenon**<br>
Don't be full of yourself. You weren't even close to cracking it last time.

**Mark**<br>
... OK.
