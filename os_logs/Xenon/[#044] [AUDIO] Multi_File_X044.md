Stop right there!

*\[Running\]*

*[→Signal Switches]*

**Kyle**<br>
This is a dead\-end. There's nowhere for you to run! Show yourself!

**????**<br>

**Kyle**<br>
I'm throwing a tear gas grenade in three seconds. If you don't want to end up a sobbing mess, stop hiding... "Mediator"! Three... Two...

*\[Things crashing\]*

**Shannon**<br>
... Eek!?

**????**<br>
......!<br>
Stay away!

**Kyle**<br>
......!? Let go of her!

**????**<br>
I told you to stay away! Do you not care about what's going to happen to this girl!? I will pull the trigger!!

**Kyle**<br>
... Didn't I tell you to go straight back home...?

**Shannon**<br>
I... I was worried about dad. I\-I'm sorry...

**????**<br>
... Dad? Umm...<br>
I\-is this your daughter? If you want her to be safe, don't come near me. Let me go...

**Kyle**<br>
Shut up! It's you... you killed Martin...

**????**<br>
......?<br>
No... I\-I didn't kill anyone! *\*breathes heavily\**...

**Kyle**<br>
Let go of her now! You think I can't hit you at this distance!?

**Shannon**<br>
Kyaa!

**Kyle**<br>
......!<br>
Mediator... you're not the only one, right? As long as you confess the names of your comrades, I'll consider asking the Bureau to make your sentence lighter.

**????**<br>
No... *\*breathes heavily\**... As long as you stop pursuing me, I won't harm your daughter.

**Kyle**<br>
Tch...

**????**<br>
What's the matter? *\*breathes heavily\**... There isn't anybody coming to help you, right? You really think you have the upper hand in this situation? You don't want... something bad...  hah... had... to happen to your daughter, don't you? That's right... nobody wants... Therefore... back off! I'm leaving...

**[Administration Bureau]**<br>
*This is the Administration Bureau call center. What is the situation?*

You little...! You made a call through the virtual internet!

**Shannon**<br>
WAAHHH!
