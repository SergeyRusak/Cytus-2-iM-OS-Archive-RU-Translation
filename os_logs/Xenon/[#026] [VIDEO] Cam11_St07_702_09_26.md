Are you really not staying for dinner? Kenta hasn't seen you for a long time. He would love to have you at the table.

**Xenon**<br>
No. You're annoying. Why do you keep wanting me to stay for dinner?

**NEKO#ΦωΦ**<br>
... Fine then! I was being nice! Get lost!

**Xenon**<br>
... Bye.

**Young Man**<br>
Crap! This is bad...

**Xenon**<br>
Hey! What are you doing?

**Young Man**<br>
Eh? Ah... I'm sorry...

**Xenon**<br>
Are you sneaking a photo of me?

**Young Man**<br>
Eh... umm... you are Xenon, right! I'm your fan! Apologies, I was too excited to see you, so I just thought I can snap a quick photo and...

**Xenon**<br>
I have fans in Node 03...?

**Young Man**<br>
Eh? Y, yes, I am indeed from Node 03. Is my appearance that obvious? Haha...

**Xenon**<br>

*Hayato Kusu, born October 1st, 678 N.A. 24 years old; blood type A...*

**Xenon**<br>
... I see. So you're an intern reporter at "08 Daily"? Isn't that the one that has been harassing me with messages and likes writing about baseless gossip?

**Hayato**<br>
Ehh? How did you...?

**Xenon**<br>
Sorry about that. I'm quite sensitive these days, so I hacked your device... You little... you even took photos of me in NEKO's room... I've deleted them all. Don't do illegal things like this anymore.

**Hayato**<br>
How could you!?... I, I mean, aren't you the same! It's illegal to look at other people's personal information without their permission!

**Xenon**<br>
Idiot, if you really care about your info, don't set your privacy setting to "Public"... Even if I don't hack your device, it won't take me more than a few minutes to find this information.

**Hayato**<br>
Uhh...

**Xenon**<br>
If you're still an intern, I suggest you quit the job. That world is not suitable for people like you. Goodbye.

**Hayato**<br>
......

**Hayato**<br>
Thank goodness that I already sent the photos to Miss Vicky...
