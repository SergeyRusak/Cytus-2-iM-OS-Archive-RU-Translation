**Davis**<br>
What's wrong, Mark? Saying that you want to speak with me in private all of a sudden.

**Mark**<br>
......

**Davis**<br>
What's the matter? Take a seat first. Don't just stand there.

**Mark**<br>
Okay.

**Mark**<br>
......

**Davis**<br>
Did something happen?

**Mark**<br>
I mentioned before... that I was also investigating the Æsir incident, right? I think it will be quicker if I directly show you all the data.

**Davis**<br>
......?

*[»»» Fast Forward »»»]*

**Davis**<br>
...... This is...... It can't be...

**Mark**<br>
I've decrypted all the connection activity. After analysis, these are the results.

**Davis**<br>
Every single signal source... points to Simon... Do you meant to tell me that Simon is Æsir?

**Mark**<br>
I didn't say that. However, that's what the data shows.

**Davis**<br>
Mark... You aren't jealous of his promotion, are you...?

**Mark**<br>
......

**Davis**<br>
I'm sorry to suspect you like this. I just don't think that you're the type of person who would do these things just for the sake of it.

**Mark**<br>
As his peer, being unable to surpass him all the time does indeed make me a bit frustrated. However, that doesn't mean that I don't respect his abilities, nor does that mean I deny my own skills.<br>
This incident has nothing to do with that. I investigated Æsir... for my own reasons.

**Davis**<br>
Your own reasons?

**Mark**<br>
There's someone I know... She was a victim of the second Æsir attack incident. As of now, she is still unconscious in the hospital.

**Davis**<br>
NEKO's stream... Why didn't you tell us about this?

**Mark**<br>
It's not someone I'm particularly close to. I figured it's not necessary to tell.<br>
Besides, I don't want to affect my mood during work...

**Davis**<br>
... I see. <br>
Nevertheless, even if this data is real, you can't really prove anything. After all, tampering with signal sources from this long ago is a pretty easy thing to do.

**Mark**<br>
Do you recall that we tried to decrypt the encrypted messages his A.I. sent him before? Right around the time when Æsir \- FEST just concluded.

**Davis**<br>
...... Yes.

**Mark**<br>
In reality, the connections related to Æsir all use the same set of encryptions, the set Simon wrote. This is different than what he wrote on his report. I started my own independent investigation after I discovered that.

**Davis**<br>
I don't understand... If it really was him... Why would he do these things?

**Mark**<br>
I said before that his A.I. is not safe, right? Not long after Æsir \- FEST, it began to have more and more autonomous actions.

**Davis**<br>
That was indeed the case...

**Mark**<br>
Everything I said from this moment on is just my baseless speculation: I suspect that when Simon said he "upgraded" his A.I., that wasn't the case. What really happened was that the A.I. "grew" on its own and has lost control. As with Simon, he could be hiding this to avoid being the one held responsible.

**Davis**<br>
......

**Mark**<br>
Cases where the A.I. evolved beyond their original algorithms have already been observed to a different degree. It's no longer something rare in this day and age. This is also the reason why the Administration Bureau has been especially careful when managing this type of technology. 

**Mark**<br>
In fact, the system Simon wrote is also a direct continuation of the one he wrote when he was still "X". Perhaps some of his logic or personality back then have been mixed into the system and that's what caused the A.I. to lose control after it experienced growth. 

**Davis**<br>
If Simon knows about this, these clues would never be found so easily.

**Mark**<br>
... I spent a lot of time decrypting these. I wouldn't say that it was done "easily"...<br>
Besides, what if the situation is that he doesn't know about it? 

**Davis**<br>
......

**Mark**<br>
It's not unheard of. Previously, there was the case where his A.I sent a message to him, yet he couldn't figure out who send it. Even though he stated that he suffered memory loss as well, in reality, I feel that things may not be in his control anymore.

**Davis**<br>
In contrast, if he does know about it, then I'm afraid this incident won't be so simple... His purpose for still keeping that A.I., and exactly what he wants to do with all those stolen memories...

**Mark**<br>
... Stop making random guesses. I said that these are just my baseless speculation.

**Davis**<br>
Regardless, I think we should still ask for an explanation directly from him. It's better that way, right...?

**Mark**<br>
I think it's best we ask the Administration Bureau to do an official investigation. Simon is very smart. If he intends to hide things from the people at A.R.C., we may not be able to handle him. On top of that, if it's truly because of the A.I.'s actions, his personal will may be a non\-factor in this case already.

**Davis**<br>
Do we need to get the admins involved...?

**Mark**<br>
Just to be certain. If he really is innocent, he should cooperate with the Bureau's investigation.

**Davis**<br>
Got it. Let's do that. I believe that he is not the culprit.

**Mark**<br>
I hope not.
