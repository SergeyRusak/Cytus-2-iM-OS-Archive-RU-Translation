## Log Content
**Xenon**<br>
Here's this month's working report. 

**Davis**<br>
Good job. If there's nothing else to report, the meeting is dismissed. Mark, remember to send me last month's contact records.

**Mark**<br>
Uh\-huh.

**Xenon**<br>
Davis, can we talk in private for a moment?

**Davis**<br>
What's up?

**Xenon**<br>
About the admins' case, I did some tracking on my own afterward. I discovered that the crime group's activity records are completely different than what the admins' told us in the report. 

**Davis**<br>
... How so?

**Xenon**<br>
The report says it was a year ago when they start operating in Node 08. However, I found out that this organization has been using the dark web to do business across the whole world for nearly a decade.<br>
There is no way the admins don't know this. I am quite certain that they are hiding something from us. 

**Davis**<br>
Is that so...? Frankly, I've been doubtful with the admins' careless attitude when it comes to internet crime for a while now. However, that's not part of our responsibility. I would advise you to not dive too far into this, or trouble might get to you.

**Xenon**<br>
All this PC crap again, just like the incident we just talked about in the meeting. The admins never set up any rules when it comes to internet crimes. In times like this, shouldn't we be doing something?

**Davis**<br>
I know you have a strong sense of justice. Your father was part of the law enforcement too. But, if you don't do things by the rules, I get joint responsibility as well.

**Xenon**<br>
This has nothing to do with my father! Do you think that your own well\-being is more important than the public's safety!?

**Davis**<br>
......

**Davis**<br>
Simon, I might be retiring next year.

**Xenon**<br>
...So?

**Davis**<br>
When that time comes, the person that will be sitting in my seat will definitely be you. A.R.C. is very powerful here in Node 08, but not to the point of overshadowing law and order.<br>
There's plenty of nonsense happening within and outside the company. I hope you can be the one to guide the world back to its righteous path.

**Xenon**<br>
... What can a mere IT department head do?

**Davis**<br>
With your talent level and contribution to the company, it's very unlikely that you'll stop here. Aim for a higher place Simon. To be honest, that's the entire department's expectation of you. 

**Xenon**<br>
... Stop talking like you know who I am. I'll deal with this case in my own way.
