Report<br>
==========<br>
\- Compared cyTus's server data from past 35 years. Found records of multiple initiation errors.<br>
\- No particular pattern in the initiation errors. System can detect and fix errors on its own.<br>
\- Judging from the excerpted log files, errors are from within the system. Since A.R.C. keeps the completed log files in a closed network, has no physical access to it right now.

Future actions: Continue to track initiation errors.<br>
