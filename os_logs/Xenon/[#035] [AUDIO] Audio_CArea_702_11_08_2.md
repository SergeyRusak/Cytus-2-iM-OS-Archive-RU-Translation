**Xenon**<br>
... Hey, where are you taking me?

**Agent N**<br>
Shut up and just come with me.

*[→Signal Switch]*

**Agent N**<br>
We're here. Now, stand still.

**Xenon**<br>
......?

*\[Punch\]*

**Xenon**<br>
Ugh!

**Agent N**<br>
This one is for your father.<br>
If he is still alive, I'm certain this is what he will do.

**Xenon**<br>
......

**Agent N**<br>
Because of my position, I never had the opportunity to talk to you since your arrest, until now<br>
Speak. What the hell is all this stuff about? Before Kyle died, he truly believed that his son has changed for good. Is this your response to his expectations? By causing all this nonsensical mess?

**Xenon**<br>
... You haven't changed one bit.

*\[Lights fire\]*

**Agent N**<br>
...... (Inhales)<br>
If it's so easy to change, I would never be able to hold his position to this day.

**Xenon**<br>
... Sorry, I didn't mean for things to turn out this way.

**Agent N**<br>
That is not what I want to hear. What happened exactly?

**Xenon**<br>
It's a bit complicated.

**Agent N**<br>
You have until this cigarette burns out to explain.

*[»»» Fast Forward»»»]*

**Xenon**<br>
... That's more or less it. The real Æsir is definitely still hiding somewhere right now. He is using the window created by all this chaos to carry out his next plan... We have no idea what secrets A.R.C. is hiding either.

**Agent N**<br>
...... (Exhales)

**Agent N**<br>
...... Kyle often used to say, "No matter what kind of justice we uphold,"...

**Xenon**<br>
"we are always the villain in someone else's story."<br>
...... His favorite saying.

**Agent N**<br>
Later, I was able to understand this saying in an even deeper way. This means that every single villain has something they upheld as their justice.

**Xenon**<br>
......

**Agent N**<br>
How should I believe that the story you just told is not a load of crap?

**Xenon**<br>
... You don't have to believe. You just have to know, that for the sake of pursuing the truth, I am willing to give up my most treasured things. Even if I become a villain in your eyes, I will not stop.

**Agent N**<br>
......

**Xenon**<br>
If you don't unlock these handcuffs now, this case will never end. By then, it doesn't matter if it's your justice or mine; they will all be reduced to ashes.

**Agent N**<br>
Those eyes... you two are indeed father and son after all.

*\[Unlocks handcuffs\]*

**Xenon**<br>
......!

*\[Punch\]*

**Xenon**<br>
Argh!?

**Agent N**<br>
The previous punch didn't draw any blood. This one should do. Hey, you punch me a few times too.

**Xenon**<br>
......Huh?

**Agent N**<br>
Quick.

**Xenon**<br>
......

*\[Punch\]*

**Agent N**<br>
... Man, do you really eat properly?<br>
Whatever, just need to cause an injury. This way, I can treat it as if we had a brawl. Oh, and my helmet too. You can break it somehow, right?

**Xenon**<br>
I can...

**Agent N**<br>
Go down this door. I will command them to go somewhere else.

**Xenon**<br>
......

**Agent N**<br>
The justice I... or Kyle upheld may no longer exist anymore. <br>
However, if it's you, maybe there is still hope.

**Xenon**<br>
... Thanks.

**Agent N**<br>
Oh, one more thing. "Willing to give up my most treasured things." Don't say that until you've lost something for real.
