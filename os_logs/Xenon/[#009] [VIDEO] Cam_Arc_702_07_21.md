## Log Content
**Davis**<br>
What's up? Is there something you want from me?

**Xenon**<br>
There's something I want to know. If you know anything, you have to tell me.

**Davis**<br>
Go ahead.

**Xenon**<br>
I did a little research on the new advisor, Colin. He used to be one of the top wanted people for both A.R.C. and the admins, right? His criminal records are quite significant too.

**Davis**<br>
Hmmm...not a big secret. There's plenty of news on this stuff.

**Xenon**<br>
Then why is A.R.C. working together with someone like this?

**Davis**<br>
In terms of academic credibility, Colin is at the very top. His father used to be an elite A.R.C. explorer too. They contributed quite a lot to technology development for the past few years. In some ways, they're on the same side with us. <br>
If A.R.C. is the leading chariot in modern technology, he is like a wild horse doing whatever he desires. The best solution for this is to have him under our control while we provide him with what he needs. That way it's mutually beneficial.

**Xenon**<br>
For someone who refused to work with us all these years, isn't it suspicious that he willingly joined us all of a sudden?

**Davis**<br>
"Willingly"' is not the word I would use. From what I've heard, Sagar was the one who persuaded him by offering him a deal: he assists us in research. In return, we'll erase his criminal records.

**Xenon**<br>
... I can never get why people would try such risky actions.

**Davis**<br>
Just like you said, he's a pain in the neck. However, to A.R.C., his talent and knowledge are indispensable resources. This is already the best\-case scenario for us.

**Xenon**<br>
Do the admins know about this?

**Davis**<br>
Yes. The people who know this are the admins, management and then you. If other employees or even worse, civilians get hold of this information, it might create commotion and panic. So I would like you to keep this a secret. 

**Xenon**<br>
... Understood. However, I would like to monitor Colin's system and internet personally. I don't think he is someone that can be kept down so easily.

**Davis**<br>
Hmm not a bad idea. Let's go with it. I can rest assured even more if you're around.

**Xenon**<br>
If there's anything fishy, we'll immediately report it to the admins.
