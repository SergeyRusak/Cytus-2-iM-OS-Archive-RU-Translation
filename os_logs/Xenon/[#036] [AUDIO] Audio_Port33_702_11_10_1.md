The transporter is over there. Thank god we made it in time. Let's go, Mad Dog. The cargo is in the last car.

**Hunter**<br>
Hnnngh\~ Dang, this s\*\*\* is heavy...

**Cherry**<br>
Don't be such a p\*\*\*\*.

**Hunter**<br>
Okay, cargo in perfect shape. Now get moving.

**ConneR**<br>
Oh, I see. Using this route to smuggle... how did I not think of this?<br>
Very clever idea, Miss Pauline.

**Xenon**<br>
Hey, is that... a human inside there?

**Hunter**<br>
So what? It's none of your business.

**Xenon**<br>
......

**Hunter**<br>
What are you trying to do? I advise you don't try anything stupid!

**Cherry**<br>
... Simon, we've gone this far already. This is the only way to get you out of here.

**Xenon**<br>
... Nothing. Now go.

**Hunter**<br>
...... Hmph.

*\[Drags Cargo\]*

**Cherry**<br>
Alright, let's board the transporter. This ride will take us back to a transportation hub. We will board another ride there that'll take us into Node 03.

**Xenon**<br>
What about you?

**ConneR**<br>
I'll figure out a way to sneak into Node 13 from there. I'm currently a criminal after all.
